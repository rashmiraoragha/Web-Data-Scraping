The accuracy of MBV prediction is important for a successful application of GS. Recently  several methods have been proposed to estimate MBV.

In this study we compared the accuracies and possible bias of five different regression methods in an empirical application in dairy cattle. Genotypes of 7 372 SNP and highly accurate EBV of 1 945 dairy bulls were used to predict MBV for protein percentage (PPT) and a profit index (Australian Selection Index  ASI).

A significant decrease in accuracy of prediction of ASI was seen in young test cohorts of bulls compared to the accuracy derived from cross-validation of the training set. This reduction was not apparent for PPT. Combining MBV predictions with pedigree based predictions gave 1.05 - 1.34 times higher accuracies compared to predictions based on pedigree alone. Some methods have largely different computational requirements  with PLSR and RR-BLUP requiring the least computing time. The four methods which use information from all SNP namely RR-BLUP  Bayes-R  PLSR and SVR generate similar accuracies of MBV prediction for genomic selection  and their use in the selection of immediate future generations in dairy cattle will be comparable. The use of FR-LS in genomic selection is not recommended. Until recently  the use of molecular genetics in commercial applications of marker-assisted selection (MAS) have focused on the use of individual genes or a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to markers [  ]. With the exception of a few genes with relatively large effects such as DGAT [] or FECB [] most candidate genes or QTL capture only a very small proportion of the total genetic variance. Recent empirical genome-wide association (GWAS) studies using a high-density SNP technology in humans  (. [–]  mice [] and cattle [] suggest that complex traits are most likely affected by many genes with a small effect. A dramatic change in terms of the use of genomic information to estimate the total genetic value for breeding animals  known as genomic selection (GS) or Genome Wide Selection (GWS) was predicted by Meuwissen . []. Using simulations  they showed that with a dense marker map covering all the chromosomes  it is possible to accurately estimate the breeding value of animals without information about their phenotype or that of close relatives. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be calculated for both sexes at an early stage in life  and therefore GS can increase the profitability and accelerate genetic gain of dairy cattle breeding by reducing the generation interval and cost of proving bulls [  ]. This is projected to restructure dairy cattle breeding schemes  many of which rely on progeny testing sires and the recording of hundreds of thousands and often millions of cows []. Whole-genome analyses require methods that are capable of handling cases where the number of marker variables greatly exceeds the number of individuals  and models are at risk of being over parameterized. Furthermore  inclusion of complex pedigrees in large animal breeding data sets may lead to population stratification and confounding of relatedness with gene or SNP effects []. A variety of methods have been suggested for the estimation of genomic breeding values. Meuwissen . [] have compared a joint least squares estimation of individually significant haplotype effects with best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) including all haplotypes and two Bayesian approaches similar to BLUP  but allowing for variation in the genetic variance accounted for by individual haplotype effects. Xu [] has used a similar Bayesian approach but has estimated additive and dominance effects attributed to individual marker loci rather than haplotype effects. As pointed out by Gianola . [] Bayesian regression methods  such as those by Meuwissen . []  require some strong  assumptions. These authors have proposed non-parametric kernel regression with a BLUP model accounting for the residual polygenes. Initially  these methods for computation of genomic breeding values have been investigated by simulation studies which may not be realistic in empirical situations and it is unlikely that the models underlying these simulations reflect the complexity of biological systems. Recently  other methods have been attempted in GWS analyses  . principal component regression []  partial least squares regression [  ]  LARS []  LASSO [  ]  and BLUP including a genomic relationship matrix []. In this study we compared the accuracies of five different regression methods for the computation of genomic prediction of genetic merit in an empirical application. The selection of methods was based on their inherent differences in the underlying assumptions and previous application in GS. We analyzed a data set of 7 372 SNP markers genotyped on 1 945 Australian Holstein Friesian dairy bulls with highly reliable estimated breeding values (EBV) derived from phenotypic records of large groups of progeny. Five regression methods were used to estimate SNP effects: fixed regression using least squares (FR-LS)  random regression BLUP (RR-BLUP)  Bayesian regression (Bayes-R)  partial least squares regression (PLSR); and support vector regression (SVR). Other than the requirement that markers are located across the genome  no additional information  such as marker location or pedigree  is required by the methods. The basic model can be denoted as where is the estimated breeding value (EBV) of sire  ( = 1  2 ...  ) and is a 1 ×  vector of SNP genotypes on bull   and () is a function relating genotypes to EBVs and can be considered as a molecular breeding value (MBV) and is a residual term. The SNP genotypes are coded as variates according to the number of copies of one SNP allele  . 0  1 or 2. We denote with  the matrix containing the column vectors of SNP genotypes at locus  ( = 1  2  ...  ). In linear regression on SNP  () is modeled as where is the regression of EBV on the additive effect of SNP   and  the number of SNP fitted in the model. The multicollinearity between SNP  . two or more SNP in high but not complete LD  is addressed by selecting a limited number of 'important' SNP. A stepwise procedure in which markers are considered for inclusion in the model one at a time was used  as applied by Habier . []. Each marker that is not already in the model is tested for inclusion in the model. In each step the most significant SNP which had a -value below a predefined threshold  was added to the model. -values of all markers in the current model were then checked and the marker with the highest -value above  was dropped from the model. The procedure stopped when no further addition or deletion was possible. The optimal -value was found by cross-validation. In RR-BLUP  SNP effects are assumed random []  with () having the form where is the effect associated with SNP   is set up as described above for additive effects. The regression coefficients are found by solving the normal equations  where  is constant for all SNPs. Differences in shrinkage between SNP still arise as a result of variation in allele frequency. Meuwissen . [] and Habier . [] have calculated  for their simulated data from known genetic and residual variances. With no knowledge of these variance components and analyzing EBV data  an appropriate value for the shrinkage parameter can be obtained by cross-validation. When EBV have a variety of reliabilities then the regression can be weighted accordingly so that   where  is a diagonal matrix of weights. In this case most reliabilities exceeded 0.85 so they were treated as homogeneous  .  = . Bayesian regression on additive SNP effects was performed as proposed by Meuwissen . [] for their method BayesA using a Gibbs Sampler. It differs from the RR-BLUP model in that each SNP effect has its own posterior distribution. This model allows each marker to have its own variance  resulting in different shrinkage of SNP effects. The prior of Meuwissen . [] was used for SNP effects. Support vector machines are algorithms developed from statistical learning theory. Support vector regression (SVR  Vapnik []) uses linear models to implement non-linear regression by mapping the input space to a higher dimensional feature space using kernel functions. A feature of SVR is that it simultaneously minimizes an objective function which includes both model complexity and the error on the training data. SVR can be considered as a specific learning algorithm for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression  first proposed for whole-genome analysis of quantitative traits by Gianola . []. A precise account of the theory of RKHS and details of SVR is beyond the scope of this article  so only a brief description is given here. For essential theoretical details and term definitions we refer the reader to Gianola . []  Gianola and van Kaam [])  Gianola and de Los Campos [] and de Los Campos . []. An application of the RKHS regression approach to estimate genetic merit for early mortality in broilers from SNP data is described in []. A more detailed introduction to SVR is given in []. RKHS regression estimation is based on minimization of the following functional (. equation  in []): where (  ()) is some loss (error) function  the second term in the equation acts as an penalty  and  is a fixed positive real number that somehow controls the trade-off between the two terms and  denotes the norm under a Hilbert space. Several choices of the loss function  in (1) are possible []. In their application of RKHS regression []  used (  ()) = (- ()) (equation () in []) as the loss function  which corresponds to the conventional least squares error criterion. In SVR the quadratic error function is replaced by a function called epsilon-insensitive loss proposed by Vapnik []: It can be shown that the minimizer of (1) using epsilon-insensitive loss can be written as:  = 1  2 ...    where  = (  ) is the kernel involving the genotypes of sires  and . The coefficients and * are the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. The loss function assigns zero loss to errors less than   thus safeguarding against overfitting. The parameter  also provides a sparse representation of the data as only a fraction of the coefficients   * are nonzero. Data points associated with non-zero coefficients are called support vectors and a detailed interpretation of support vectors is given in []. Unlike the case of the quadratic loss function  where the coefficients are found by solving a linear system  using epsilon-insensitive loss the coefficients are the solutions to a quadratic programming problem. In our implementation of SVR we used a Gaussian kernel. In order to solve the SVR regression problem three meta-parameters must be specified; the insensitivity zone   a penalty parameter  > 0 that determines the trade-off between approximation error and the amount up to which deviations larger than  are tolerated and the bandwidth of the kernel function. Cross validation employing a grid search was used to tune the meta-parameters. A dimension reduction procedure  partial least squares regression (PLSR  [])  was used for modeling without imposing strong assumptions. The main idea of PLSR is to build orthogonal components (called 'latent components') from the original predictor matrix  and use them for prediction in place of the original variables. Thus  () can be expressed as: where is latent component  ( = 1  2...  ) and generally  <<. PLSR is similar to the well-known principal component regression (PCR)  both methods construct a matrix of latent components  as a linear transformation of    =   where  is a matrix of weights. The difference is that PCR extracts components that explain the variance of   whereas PLSR extracts components that have a large covariance with   . the columns of weight matrix  are defined such that the squared sample covariance matrix between  and the latent components is maximized under the constraint that the latent components are mutually uncorrelated. Different techniques to extract the latent components exist  and each gives rise to a variant of PLSR. We implemented PLSR using an algorithm by Dayal and MacGregor []  which does not require the calculation of the sample covariance matrix of  and which we have used previously []. A different PLS algorithm was used by Solberg . [] to predict genomic breeding values in their simulation study. The optimal model complexity (. number of latent components) was estimated by cross-validation. A total of 1 945 progeny tested Holstein Friesian dairy bulls born between 1955 and 2002 were used in the study. The phenotypes used were Australian breeding values (EBV) taken from the August 2007 Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS; ) evaluation. The traits analyzed included protein percentage (PPT) and Australian Selection Index (ASI). ASI is a production based index that combines protein yield  fat yield and milk yield EBV and is weighted in relation to the value of the milk components: (ASI = 3.8 × protein EBV + 0.9 × fat EBV - 0.048 × milk EBV). The mean reliability of the EBV for both ASI and PPT was 0.89  with corresponding distribution of variation in range of reliability shown in Figure . The distribution of EBV for both ASI and PPT for all 1 945 bulls is shown in Figure  and   respectively. . The genotypic data belonged to a panel of 1 546 bulls genotyped for a 15K SNP chip and of 441 bulls for a GeneChip Bovine Mapping 25K SNP chip . There were 9 217 SNP and 44 bulls in common between these two datasets. A combined data set on 7 372 common SNP were extracted for the present study after removing SNP with low minor allele frequency (< 0.01)  with low call rates (<80%)  that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( = 0.0001) or which showed inconsistent inheritance []. The proportion of missing SNP genotypes was less than 1%. We performed genotype imputation using the NIPALS (nonlinear iterative partial least squares  []) algorithm  which performs principal component analysis in the presence of missing data. To assess the ability to predict breeding values of young bulls based on SNP data before progeny data were available  animals born before 1998 (N = 1 239) were included in the training set. Bulls born between 1998 and 2002 represented five single year cohorts and were allocated to test sets according to their year of birth. Applying FR-LS  RR-BLUP  SVR and PLSR requires the selection of appropriate meta-parameters. Model optimization was performed by 5-fold cross-validation. The complete training set (N = 1 239) was partitioned in K = 5 folds. For a given value of the meta-parameter(s)  the prediction model is estimated using K-1 folds  and the predictive capacity of the model is assessed by applying the estimated model to the individuals in the left-out fold and this process is repeated K times so that every fold is left out once. The value of  which minimized the average mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) in the K test sets was then used in the model to estimate the SNP effects from the full training set. The correlation coefficient between the realized EBV and the predicted MBV (r) was used as a measure of the accuracy of MBV prediction. The realized EBV were linearly regressed on the predicted MBV  where the regression coefficient b reflects the degree of bias of the MBV prediction. The interest here is the comparisons between bulls and therefore the constant estimated in the regression of EBV on MBV is of less interest and is not reported. The bias relates to the size of the absolute differences between MBV among cohorts  . the estimate of the difference between a pair of bulls is greater (b < 1) or less (b > 1) than the difference between their EBV. A regression coefficient of one indicates no bias. The MBV predictions of young bulls were combined with pedigree based predictions into an estimate of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) as GEBV = (w MBV + w SMGS)/(w + w)  where SMGS are predictions based on the sire maternal-grandsire pathway and  with i = 1 for MBV and i = 2 for SMGS. For MBV  R was calculated as the squared correlation between realized EBVs and MBV predictions (r) from cross-validation of the training data. For SMGS  R was calculated as the squared correlation between the realized EBV and SMGS predictions calculated at the time of the birth of the bull calves (r). As a measure of the accuracy of GEBV prediction we calculated the correlation between realized EBVs and GEBV predictions (r). An analysis of variance was performed to investigate the effect of trait  method and test year on the accuracy and bias of MBV prediction. The regression coefficient was log-transformed to account for non-normality and unstable variance. A single linear model was fitted to each of the metrics  where  is either r or logb   is a mean   is the effect of trait (PPT  ASI)   is the effect of test cohort (1998  1999 ...2002) including the 5-fold cross-validation set as a level of year;  is the effect of method (FR-LS  RR-BLUP  Bayes-R  PLSR  SVR)      and  are two-way interactions between main effects; and  is a random error. For Bayes-R  the MCMC chain was run for 200 000 cycles with the first 50 000 samples discarded as burn in. Posterior estimates of SNP effects are based on 15 000 samples  drawing every 10 sample after burn-in. The Gauss-Seidel algorithm with residual uptake suggested by Legarra and Misztal [] was used in Bayes-R. FR-LS  PLSR  RR-BLUP and Bayes-R were implemented in Fortran  for SVR analyses we used the C++ library LIBSVM []. Despite the fact that most sires were pre-selected as young bulls on the basis of pedigree information  the distribution for both ASI and PPT is fairly symmetric (Figure  and ). One would not expect a noticeable genetic trend for PPT which was not part of the selection goal in the past. ASI was introduced in 1997 such that 63% of animals were born before the first ASI EBVs became available  ASI and was incorporated into a new profit-centered breeding objective in 2003. The majority of the sires were test mated at approximately one year of age and their daughters subsequently brought into milk and performance tested. The body responsible for the genetic evaluation of dairy cattle in Australia publishes a single reliability value for all production traits and ASI. The published reliabilities of the EBV for ASI and PPT had an average of 0.89  with over 84% of animals having reliabilities of 0.85 or higher (Figure ). The age distribution of the genotyped bulls is shown in Figure . Around 50% of the bulls were born after 1995  with a greater number of animals in the more recent cohorts. The use of PLSR for genomic prediction has been described before [  ] but we briefly illustrate the method by showing the cross-validation results for the analysis of ASI (Figure ). A series of models with increasing numbers of latent components from 1 to 20 was fitted. The proportion of variance explained in the training samples shows that a small number of latent components provided an adequate fit of the data  with the first eight latent components explaining more than 90% of the EBV variance and the first latent component accounting for 34% alone. The prediction error in the corresponding test sets (MSEP) identified the first five latent components as having the lowest MSEP (Figure ). The model with five latent components used only 8% of the SNP variance in the training set  suggesting a high degree of multicollinearity among SNP loci. . Shown is the mean prediction error (MSEP) in the training (MSEP) data set  the average MSEP in the 5-fold cross-validation samples (MSEP)  the proportion of EBV (Var) and SNP variance (Var) explained in the training data for models with an increasing number of latent components; the optimal prediction model includes the first 5 latent components  identified by the smallest MSEP. Table  provides a summary statistic of optimizing the threshold parameter  used to select SNP for the FR-LS prediction model by cross-validation. Shown are the mean accuracies obtained by predicting the five cross-validation samples  standard errors of accuracy and bias of prediction were computed from the variance of the means of the five cross-validation samples. As expected  the number of markers selected in the prediction model decreased with more stringent threshold values of . The optimal model for ASI with the lowest MSEP was obtained with  = 0.001 including 33 markers  resulting in an accuracy of MBV prediction of 0.53. Similarly the best model for PPT was obtained at  = 0.001 (based on 30 SNP on average) with accuracy of prediction of 0.43  whereas the worst model was obtained at  = 0.1 (with inclusion of 215.6 SNP on average) with an accuracy of prediction of 0.35. In general the differences in accuracy of prediction between models including different number of SNP are small  and are small compared to their standard error. The degree of bias is assessed by comparing the regression coefficient of EBV on MBV with the value 1. The results show that for all a values predictions had a large bias as shown by a regression coefficient markedly less than 1 and bias decreased with decreasing number of SNPs. Table  summarizes the results for the various methods obtained from cross-validation of the training set. Accuracies of prediction ranged from 0.53 to 0.72 for ASI and 0.43 to 0.58 for PPT  respectively. All methods that used the information of all 7 372 SNP outperformed FR-LS. Accuracies of prediction and prediction errors for methods that estimate effects of all markers were essentially the same  although for ASI and PPT  SVR had the lowest MSEP  and the highest accuracy of prediction of 0.72 and 0.58  respectively. For both traits predictions obtained by FR-LS and PLSR had the largest bias  whereas for RR-BLUP  SVR and Bayes-R the regression of EBV on MBV was close to one. Table  shows the accuracy of MBV prediction of young bulls according to their year of birth and of the total test sample containing 706 animals. Marker effects were estimated using all animals in the training set with the best model of each method obtained by cross-validation. The FR-LS models included 48 SNP for ASI and 29 SNP for PPT. For ASI  accuracies of prediction (r) of all young bulls were 0.45  0.42  0.41  0.39  0.27 for SVR  PLSR  Bayes-R  RR-BLUP and FR-LS  respectively. As for ASI  accuracies of MBV prediction of PPT were very similar between methods that used all SNP information (r = 0.55-0.61)  whereas FR-LS was the least accurate method (r = 0.47). In general the MBV predictions of PPT showed lower bias compared to those of ASI. MBV predictions of ASI obtained by all methods resulted in inflated differences in the relative rankings of bulls compared to relative rankings based on EBV. For PPT  predictions obtained by RR-BLUP and SVR were close to being unbiased compared to predictions of MBV obtained by PLSR and Bayes-R. Figure  shows fits relating MBV predictions and realized EBVs of ASI and PPT in a single cross-validation sample  and in a young bull cohort 1998 for each of the five methods. FR-LS showed a larger dispersion of MBV across the range of EBV in cohort 1998 for both traits compared to the other methods  which is consistent with the lower accuracy seen with this method. . To avoid cluttering predictions are plotted for a single fold of the cross-validation (CV) of the training data set and young bull cohort 1998; ASI: Australian Selection Index; PPT: protein percentage; FR-LS: fixed regression-least squares; RR-BLUP: random regression-BLUP; Bayes-R: Bayesian regression; SVR: support vector regression; PLSR: partial least squares regression. Accuracies of MBV prediction of ASI in young bull cohorts were considerably lower compared to the accuracy obtained by cross-validation of the training set  whereas for PPT predictions of the test data set were as accurate as the predictions obtained from cross-validation. As depicted in Figure   the EBV variance for ASI in the test sample is much lower relative to the cross-validation sample  which can partly explain the decrease in accuracy of predictions of ASI in young bull cohorts. Correlations between MBV predictions obtained by cross-validation of the training data set and the test data set of young bulls are shown in Table . Predictions obtained by FR-LS were considerably less similar (r = 0.72-0.83) to all other methods. Thus using a smaller number of SNP as fixed effects produces somewhat different predictions to methods which use all SNP. The correlations between methods that used all SNP information were very high (r>0.9) for both ASI and PPT. Figure  shows the distribution of SNP effects along the genome estimated in the training data set for four methods for ASI and PPT. Relatively few SNP are used by the FR-LS method for both traits. The other methods assign relatively small effects to most of the SNP. However  the distribution for PPT depicts a small number of SNP with relatively large effects. All methods displayed very similar clustering of SNP with large effects along the genome. . The right most 772 SNPs are unassigned to chromosomes; ASI: Australian Selection Index; PPT: protein percentage; FR-LS: fixed regression-least squares; RR-BLUP: random regression-BLUP; Bayes-R: Bayesian regression. The accuracy of genomic predictions depends on the number of animals that are used to estimate the SNP effects []. The accuracy of MBV prediction estimated by PLSR from training data sets of increasing size are shown in Table . Larger training data sets did not result in significant gains in accuracy of MBV prediction in year cohorts of young bulls. In all cases predictions of PPT were more accurate than of ASI. GEBV predictions for bulls born between 1998 and 2002 were calculated by combining the MBV predictions with the sire maternal-grandsire pathway predictions  which were calculated at the time of birth of the young bull calves (Table ). The accuracy of GEBV prediction of ASI was 1.06 - 1.34 times higher than the accuracy of the pedigree based prediction  and 1.16 - 1.27 times higher for PPT. Among the methods FR-LS had the lowest accuracy and the differences between the other methods were small. Abridged analysis of variance tables for the accuracy and bias of MBV prediction are shown in Table . The method and the interaction between trait and year showed significant effects on the accuracy of MBV prediction. Accuracies of prediction by FR-LS and SVR were significantly different from other methods  with SVR being the most and FR-LS the least accurate method (additional file ). Accuracy of prediction obtained by cross-validation of the training data was significantly higher than the accuracy of prediction in cohort 2002. The interactions between method and trait and between trait and year showed significant effects on the regression of EBV on MBV. Computing time is important  particularly for cross-validation and implementation in practice which requires frequent re-estimation of breeding values. The computational demand of the various methods is shown in Table . The machine used for all calculations had a dual core Intel D 3.2 GHz CPU. The PLSR and RR-BLUP methods  took less than 1 min to calculate the marker effects for a single replicate of the training data. The requirements of Bayes-R are several orders of magnitude higher (~421 min). The computational burden for SVR lies in the grid search for the meta-parameters and also requires the computation of the kernel matrix in the prediction step. PLSR  RR-BLUP and SVR all scale well to larger number of SNPs. The concept of genomic selection was first raised over eight years ago []  but it was not until the advent of high capacity genotyping platforms that empirical data sets became available in dairy cattle [–]. Initial reports on efficiencies and pros and cons of different statistical approaches for genomic selection have been conducted largely on simulated data sets (. [        –]) and to a lesser extent in real data (. [      ]. Simulation studies  although informative  are strongly dependent on the underlying assumptions  some of which may be biologically unrealistic or limited in their complexity. This paper describes the performance of five statistical approaches for the prediction of molecular and genomic breeding values using empirical data. The choice of methods evaluated here represent a range of methods proposed previously for the potential use in genomic selection including variable selection methods (FR-LS  [    ]  shrinkage methods (Bayes-R and BLUP  [    ]); support vector learning methods (SVR  [  ]) and dimension reduction methods (PLSR  [  ]). Methods for calculating genomic breeding values have to deal with the problem of multicollinearity and over-parameterization resulting from fitting many parameters to relatively small data sets. The FR-LS regression method  which exploits a reduced subset of selected SNP consistently had lower accuracy and a larger bias of prediction than the other methods. Bayes-R  RR-BLUP  SVR and PLSR which use all available SNP information performed remarkably similarly; even though these methods are very different from each other. The performance of all methods depends on one or more meta-parameters. For RR-BLUP  SVR and PLSR optimal values of the meta-parameters are found by minimizing the prediction error using cross-validation  potentially leading to more robust predictions than Bayes-R where the posterior estimates of SNP effects are greatly affected by the choice of the parameters in the prior distributions. Using the same priors as in [] Bayes-R performed similar to the optimized models of RR-BLUP  SVR and PLSR. One reason why these priors performed well might be that the frequency distribution of estimated SNP effects for ASI and PPT somewhat resembles the frequency distribution of SNP effects underlying the simulation in [] which was derived from published estimated QTL effects []. It appears that the gain in accuracy of RR-BLUP  Bayes-R  SVR and PLSR over FR-LS is related to the increased number of SNP included in the model. FR-LS fitted only 48 SNP for ASI and 29 SNP for PPT in the prediction equations and including more SNP did not result in higher accuracies in the cross-validation set (Table ). It is well known that FR-LS estimates of a subset of SNP effects or QTL are biased upwards and that SNP selection methods perform poorly on multicollinear markers []. An advantage of the use of multicollinear SNP is that it can increase the accuracy of estimates of effects. SNPs in high LD define a larger segment of genome and the standard deviation of the estimated effect of the segment is reduced by a factor of  when the average of n SNP is used instead of a single SNP. This averaging takes place when many SNP in high linkage disequilibrium are used to construct a model. An analogy is encountered in QTL mapping  when QTL inference is related to the peak area of a QTL  rather than the peak height at a given position. In general  prediction is not seriously affected by multicollinearity as long as the correlational structure observed in the training sample persists in the prediction population  . []. With close genetic relationships between bulls in the training and tests set  as was the case here  methods that fit more SNPs capture more of the genetic relationships which can in fact lead to an increase in accuracies as shown by Habier . []. For example  sons and grandsons of the 10 most popular ancestors accounted for 37.6% of bulls in the training data set and 32.7% of young bulls in the test data set. As technology platforms advance it is possible to extend the density to many thousands of SNP genotypes per individual  possibly capturing all sources of genomic variation with entire genomes being sequenced per individual. Such technology platforms will only exacerbate the curse of dimensionality and computational burden of a method will become more important. In particular  PLSR and RR-BLUP are very fast methods. The use of methods based on Bayesian regression on the other hand  such as BayesA  might be prohibitive when the number of SNP is large. For SVR computing time does not depend on the number of SNP but rather on the animals that are genotyped. The relevance of methods which focus on identifying a subset of the available SNP will remain high while the cost of dense chips is high. Although subset selection by FR-LS performed poorly in our study and therefore cannot be recommended  some authors reported similar or improved accuracy when using a pre-selected subset of SNP. In the study of Moser . [] the selection was performed within the PLSR and in Gonzalez-Recio . [] within a kernel regression framework. The use of SNP subset selection in genomic selection needs further testing. In the end  it may be of limited use if multiple traits require so many SNP that the cost of genotyping them is similar to the cost of a high density chip. A key issue in genomic selection is predicting genetic merit in young animals across a wide range of traits. In the case of dairy cattle breeding  this is particularly advantageous given the sex limited expression of most traits and the long generation interval due to relying on progeny testing to select superior replacement sires. The potential advantages of using genomic selection in breeding programs of dairy cattle have been demonstrated by Schaeffer [] and König . []. Although the assumptions may not be met by the currently achieved accuracies of GEBV  the principles of reduced generation interval and increased accuracy of selection of young bulls at time of entry into progeny test all show substantial benefits from increase in genetic gain and reduced costs. Genomic breeding values that combined the marker-based MBV with a pedigree based polygenic effect had higher accuracies than MBV or polygenic component alone  which is consistent with reports in dairy cattle [  ]  wheat and mice []. We show here that accuracies of GEBV were approximately 1.3 times larger than accuracies of sire maternal-grandsire pathway breeding values  which are currently used to select bull calves to enter progeny testing. Most of the bulls in our study belong to the same breeding program as the population used to estimate GEBV by Hayes . []  but there was no overlap between the training sets between studies as their training set included animals born between 1998 and 2002  some of which are presumably part of our test sets. Although direct comparison of both studies is difficult since there were differences in the number of bulls in the training data and in the method used to calculate accuracies of GEBV  Hayes . [] reported higher accuracies of GEBV for ASI than for PPT. It remains uncertain to what extent MBV predictions of the same trait derived from different populations  or even different reference populations within the same breed  are robust and warrants further examination. Improvement of accuracies of genomic predictions are likely to benefit from substantially increased training sets as individual SNP effects are estimated with greater accuracy [  ]. In contrast with observations by VanRaden . []  an increase in accuracy of MBV was not apparent with an increased number of bulls in the training set (Table ). This discrepancy may rest with the smaller range in the number of bulls in the training set in our data (1 239-1 882) compared with 1 151 to 3 576 used in []. Gains in accuracy are expected from increased SNP densities  as a larger proportion of the QTL variance is explained by markers and effects of QTL can be predicted across generations as shown in simulated data sets [  ]. VanRaden . [] have shown a consistent but small increase in the coefficient of determination for genomic prediction for North American Holstein bulls from 0.39 to 0.43 when the map density increased from 9 604 to 38 416 SNP. We would expect a similar relatively small increase of the accuracy of MBV prediction with greater SNP densities here. The reason is that many animals in our training and test data share DNA segments from a small number of sires and relatively few markers are required to trace the chromosome segments shared between related animals separated by only a few generations. To what extent increasing SNP densities improves the accuracy of genomic prediction in populations with low effective population size remains to be seen. Greater SNP densities may be required in more divergent populations or when individual animal phenotypes are analyzed instead of EBVs derived from progeny test data. As noted above  markers used in the statistical model not only estimate QTL effects but also capture genetic relationships between individuals in the training data []. Habier . [  ] and Zhong . [] have demonstrated differences in the contribution of LD between marker and QTL and marker-based relatedness for different statistical methods. They show a gradual decline of accuracy of prediction for individuals which are removed several generations from the training data set. Habier . [] have found that RR-BLUP is affected by genetic relationships to a larger degree than FR-LS  predicting a steeper decline in the accuracy for RR-BLUP in generations following training. Here  we did not observe a gradual decline in accuracy of prediction  in fact for ASI correlations for all methods were higher in animals born in year 2000 compared to animals born in year 1998. Small rank changes in the performance of the methods between test years did occur  but there was no strong evidence for different rates of decline of accuracies in later test years between methods. This is supported by the non-significant interaction between method and year from the ANOVA. In practice  it will be difficult to differentiate between improvements in the accuracy of prediction resulting from modelling relationships via SNP or from LD between SNP and QTL. It is still likely that a significant component of the gains of GS will reside with predicting relationships more accurately on the genome level either within families [] or even across families. For industry applications it is feasible and most likely that prediction equations can be updated as information on new animals becomes available  and this will ensure a minimal lag between animals in the training set and the test set. In practice  the accuracy of predictions of future outcomes needs to be assessed. The partitioning of the data depicts this situation with older bulls in the training data and younger bulls in the test data. Care must be taken when the accuracy of future predictions is evaluated by cross-validation of random subsets of the training data set. A significant decrease in accuracy of prediction of young bull cohorts was observed for ASI relative to the accuracy obtained by cross-validation of the training data set  whereas for PPT the reduction in accuracy was negligible (Tables  and ). In general a decrease in the accuracy of MBV in young bull cohorts might be expected  since accuracies of realized EBV for early proofs are likely to be lower than the accuracies of realized EBV of the older bulls in the training data set. Initially  this would not explain the differences in accuracy of MBV of young bulls seen between ASI and PPT  as the body responsible for the genetic evaluation of dairy cattle in Australia publishes a single reliability value for all production traits and ASI. However  heritabilities for the ASI component traits (0.25) are lower than for PPT (0.40) and more training animals may be required to obtain accurate prediction equations for traits with lower heritability. Another reason for a decrease in accuracy of prediction of younger bull cohorts may be a reduction in EBV variance in pre-selected bull teams. As shown in Figure   the variance of PPT and ASI (column 1 and 2  respectively) of the training animals is greater compared to the variance in one of the young bull cohorts (column 3 and 4  respectively). This is likely to have affected the accuracy of ASI  since ASI is a strong component of the multi-trait profit index on which young bulls are currently selected  whereas no pre-selection is likely to have occurred on PPT. Finally the genetic architecture underlying traits may also affect the robustness of accuracy of prediction from SNP data  since for PPT compared to ASI  fewer individual SNP with relatively large effect contributed to the prediction equations. Five regression methods proposed to calculate genomic breeding values have been empirically evaluated using data of 1 945 dairy bulls typed for 7 373 genome-wide SNP markers. From our evaluations a number of important observations can be made. Firstly  FR-LS based models included a small number of markers and had poor accuracy and large bias of prediction. Secondly  accuracies of MBV prediction obtained by methods that estimate effects of all SNP were remarkably similar  despite the different assumptions underlying the models. Thirdly  accuracies derived by cross-validation with random subsets of the training data are likely to overestimate the realized accuracies of future predictions for some traits in young bull cohorts. Combining marker and pedigree information increased the accuracy of prediction but the gain was different for the two traits investigated. Computational demand of a method is potentially important in implementing genomic selection in practice and was lowest for PLSR and RR-BLUP  and highest for Bayes-R.

Available observations may take the form of individual phenotypes  repeated observations  records on close family members such as progeny  estimated breeding values (EBV) or their deregressed counterparts from genetic evaluations. The literature indicates that researchers are inconsistent in their approach to using EBV or deregressed data  and as to using the appropriate methods for weighting some data sources to account for heterogeneous variance. A logical approach to using information for genomic prediction is introduced  which demonstrates the appropriate weights for analyzing observations with heterogeneous variance and explains the need for and the manner in which EBV should have parent average effects removed  be deregressed and weighted. An appropriate deregression for genomic regression analyses is  where EBV excludes parent information and  is the reliability of that EBV. The appropriate weights for deregressed breeding values are neither the reliability nor the prediction error variance  two alternatives that have been used in published studies  but the ratio (1 - )/[( + (1 - )/)] where  > 0 is the fraction of genetic variance not explained by markers. Phenotypic information on some individuals and deregressed data on others can be combined in genomic analyses using appropriate weighting. Genomic prediction [] involves the use of marker genotypes to predict the genetic merit of animals in a target population based on estimates of regression of performance on high-density marker genotypes in a training population. Training populations might involve genotyped animals with alternative types of information including single or repeated measures of individual phenotypic performance  information on progeny  estimated breeding values (EBV) from genetic evaluations  or a pooled mixture of more than one of these information sources. In pooling information of different types  it is desirable to avoid any bias introduced by pooling and to account for heterogeneous variance so that the best use is made of available information. Uncertainty as to whether or not EBV should be used directly or deregressed or replaced by measures such as daughter yield deviation (DYD) []  and the manner in which information should be weighted  if at all  has been apparent for some time in literature related to discovering and fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL). Typically in fixed effects models with uncorrelated residuals  observations would be weighted by the inverse of their variances. Morsci et al. [] pointed out the counter intuitive behavior of using the reciprocal of the variance of breeding values as weights in characterization of QTL and followed the arguments of Rodriguez-Zas et al. [] in using reliability as weights. Rodriguez-Zas et al. [] did analyses that were limited by features of the chosen software so EBV/2 (i.e. predicted transmitting ability PTA) were multiplied by the square root of reliability and analyzed unweighted. Georges et al. [] deregressed PTA to construct DYD and weighted these using the inverse of the variance of the DYD. Spelman et al. [] had direct access to DYD and similarly weighted these by the inverse of their scaled variance  equivalent to using the inverse of reliability as weights. Other researchers have reported the use of PTA []  standardized PTA [  ] or DYD weighted by respective reliabilities []. The uncertainty associated with using information for QTL discovery has recently been extended to genomic prediction. An Interbull survey [] of methods being used in various countries for genomic prediction of dairy cattle reported that some researchers used deregressed proofs weighted with corresponding reliabilities  others used DYD weighted by effective daughter contributions  while yet others used EBV without any weighting. The objective of this paper is to present a logical argument for using deregressed information  appropriately weighted for analysis. For simplicity  we consider the residual variance from the perspective of an additive model but the deregression and weighting concepts extend to analyses that include dominance and epistasis. Genomic prediction involves the use of genotypes or haplotypes to predict genetic merit. Conceptually  it involves two phases  a training phase where the genotypic or haplotypic effects are estimated  typically as random effects  in a mixed model scenario  followed by an application phase where the genomic merit of selection candidates is predicted from the knowledge on their genotypes and previously estimated effects from the training phase. The ideal data for training would be true genetic merit data observed on unrelated animals in the absence of selection. In that case  the model equation would be: where  is a vector of true genetic merit (i.e. breeding value BV) with () =   the scalar  is the genetic variance and  can be constructed using the theory from combined linkage disequilibrium and linkage analyses []   is an intercept   is an incidence matrix whose columns are covariates for substitution  genotypic or haplotypic effects   are effects to be estimated  () =    is a genomic relationship matrix [–]   is the lack of fit  () =   hopefully small and will be  if BV could be perfectly estimated as a linear function of observed marker genotypes. In different settings   might be defined as a vector of fixed effects [] or a vector of random effects []. Even when  is fixed   is random because   which contains genotypes  is random. However  in genomic analyses  is treated as fixed because the analysis is conditional on the observed genotypes. The philosophical issues related to the randomness of  and  are discussed in detail by Gianola [] but for our context it is sufficient to define () =  without explicitly specifying distributional properties of  or . Genotypes used as covariates in  are unlikely to capture all the variation in true genetic merit  either because they are not comprehensively covering the entire genome  or because linkage disequilibrium between markers and causal genes is not perfect. Knowledge of  is required in the analysis whether  is treated as a fixed (e.g. GLS) or random effect (e.g. BLUP). In practice with experiments that involve related animals  it is unreasonable to assume  has a simple form such as a diagonal matrix since that implies a zero covariance between lack of fit effects for different animals  however  it can be approximated using knowledge on the pedigree using the additive relationship matrix   []. These lack of fit covariances can be accommodated by fitting a polygenic effect for each animal  in addition to the marker genotypes []  or accounted for by explicitly modeling correlated residuals. For a non-inbred animal    therefore  and the proportion of the genetic variance not accounted for by the markers can be defined to be . The scalar   will be close to 0 if markers account for most of the genetic variation and close to 1 if markers perform poorly. In practice we do not have the luxury of using true BV as data in genomic prediction. A more common circumstance might involve training based on phenotypic observations that include fixed effects on phenotype denoted  where  is an incidence matrix for fixed non-genetic effects in . An appropriate model equation for phenotypes is where  is a vector of random non-genetic or residual effects. In comparison to (1)  the use of  for training involves the addition of the vectors  and  to the left- and right-hand side  inflating the variance and giving with  since cov(  ) = . This model can be fitted by explicitly including a random polygenic effect for   or by accounting for the non-diagonal variance-covariance structure of the residuals defined as var ( + ). Including a polygenic term is not typically done in genomic prediction analyses [  ]  and when undertaken does not seem to markedly alter the accuracy of genomic predictions [Habier D. Personal communication]. Assuming var ( + ) is a scaled identity matrix facilitates the computing involved in fitting this model  as the relevant mixed model equations can be modified by multiplying the left- and right-hand sides by the unknown scale parameter as is typically done in single trait analyses. However  this is not an option if residuals are heterogeneous  for example  because they involve varying numbers of repeated observations. Consider the circumstance where the training observations are a vector  representing observations that are the mean of  observations on the individual with  potentially varying. In that case  equation () becomes With   a diagonal matrix with elements  with  being the phenotypic variance  heritability   and repeatability . Ignoring off-diagonal elements of   the elements of the inverse of  with  = var() +  would for non-inbred animals be . In fixed effects models  this matrix can be arbitrarily scaled for convenience. In univariate random effects models  a common practice is to formulate mixed model equations using the ratios of residual variance to variances of the random effects. Here  it makes sense to factor out the residual variance of one phenotypic observation  i.e.   from the expression for the residual variance of the mean of  observations. In this circumstance  a scaled inverse of the residual variance being  or equivalently which can be used for weighted regression analyses treating marker effects as fixed or random. When  = 0  the genetic effects can be perfectly explained by the model  and for  = 1  a single observation on the individual  the weight is 1 for any heritability. Scaling the weights is convenient because records with high information exceed 1 and the weights are trait independent which is useful when analysing multiple traits with identical heritability and information content. In some cases the training data may represent the mean of  individual measurements on several offspring  rather than the mean phenotype of the genotyped animal. In that circumstance  the residual variance includes a genetic component for the mate and Mendelian sampling. For half-sib progeny means with unrelated mates and no common environmental variance  . However  the half-sib progeny mean contains only half the genetic merit of the parent  therefore the genotypic covariates need to be halved  or the mean doubled  in order to analyse data that includes records on genotyped individuals and records on offspring of genotyped individuals. The variance for twice the progeny mean is   and adding   factoring out  and inverting gives For full-sib progeny means the intraclass correlation of residuals will include a genetic component and perhaps a common environmental component (e.g. litter  with variance  and  giving  for unrelated parents. Adding variation due to  factoring out  and inverting gives This expression can be used as weights in the fixed or random regression of full-sib progeny means on parent average marker genotypes. An estimated breeding value  typically derived using BLUP  can be recognised as the true BV plus a prediction error. That is  . Accordingly  training on EBV might be viewed as extending the model equation in (1) by the addition of the prediction error  in the same way that (3) was derived by the addition of a residual nongenetic component. The model equation would therefore be There are at least two issues with this formulation of the problem  which may not be immediately apparent  and which both result from properties of BLUP. The first issue is that the addition of the prediction error term to the left- and right-hand side of (8) actually reduces rather than increases the variance  despite the fact that diagonal elements of  must exceed 0  in contrast to the addition of non-genetic random residual effects in (3). That is   whereas var() < var()  due to shrinkage properties of BLUP estimators []. Generally   but for BLUP  so that  implying . The reduction in variance of the training data comes about because prediction errors are negatively correlated with BV as can be readily shown since . This means that superior animals tend to be underevaluated (i.e. have negative prediction errors) whereas inferior animals tend to be overevaluated. This is a consequence of shrinkage estimation and prediction errors being uncorrelated with EBV  i.e. . In order to account for the covariance between the prediction errors and the BV  a model that accounted for such covariance would need to be fitted. Such models are computationally more demanding compared to models whereby the fitted effects and residuals are uncorrelated. The second issue resulting from the properties of BLUP  is that it is a shrinkage estimator  that shrinks observations towards the mean  the extent of shrinkage depending upon the amount of information. This is apparent if one considers the regression of phenotype on true genotype (i.e. BV) which is 1  whereas the regression of EBV on BV is equal to  = 1  where  is the reliability of the EBV (for animal ) or squared correlation between BV and EBV. In the context of any marker locus  the contrast in EBV between genotypes at a particular locus is shrunk relative to the contrast that would be obtained if BV or phenotypes were used as data  with the shrinkage varying according to . We are  however  interested in estimating the effect of a marker on phenotype  but we get a lower value for the contrast if EBV with  = 1 are used as data  rather than using phenotypes. A further complication is that training data based on EBV typically comprise individuals with varying . This problem can be avoided by deregressing or unshrinking the EBV. The solution to the model fitting problems associated with the reduced variance of EBV and the inconsistent regression of EBV on genotype according to reliability can both be addressed by inflating the EBV. Rather than fitting (8)  we will fit the linearly inflated data represented as  for some diagonal matrix . That is  we will fit: for some matrix  chosen so that  and  is a constant. Since  then this expression will be 0 when . For this value     a constant for all animals regardless of their reliability. Accordingly  the deregression matrix is  =  and the deregressed observations are . Note in passing that the nature of the deregression will depend upon the EBV base. Genetic evaluations are typically adjusted to a common base before publication  by addition or subtraction of some constant. The EBV should be deregressed after removing the post-analysis base adjustment or by explicitly accounting for the base in the deregression procedure []. To show the dependence of the deregression to the post-analysis base  supposes that EBV are adjusted to a base  b. Then a linear contrast in deregressed EBV without removing the base effect is  unless . Marker effects are typically estimated as linear combinations of data  and will therefore be sensitive to the base adjustment. A deregressed observation represents a single value that encapsulates all the information available on the individual and its relatives  as if it was a single observation with  = . This can be shown by recognising that  is the regression of genotype on phenotype. Taking the deregressed observation to be the phenotype  . Training on deregressed EBV is therefore like training on phenotypes with varying . Provided  >   training on deregressed EBV is equivalent to having a trait with higher heritability. However  as explained later  we recommend removing ancestral information from the deregressed EBV. Deregressed observations have heterogeneous variance when  varies among individuals. The residual variance of a particular deregressed observation is  but  and  so the residual variance expression simplifies to . Ignoring the off-diagonal elements of var() as before  the diagonals of the inverse of the residual variance after factoring out  are  which simplifies to give an expression analogous to (5) with  = 1 and  = . Note that the weight in (10) approaches  as <U+2192>1 in which case the weight tends to infinity as <U+2192>0. This is the same as would occur when the number of offspring <U+2192>8  and  is used as a weight. Animal model evaluations by BLUP using the inverse relationship matrix shrink individual and progeny information towards parent average (PA) EBV []. It makes sense to remove the PA effect as part of the deregression process for two reasons. First  some animals may have EBV with no individual or progeny information. These animals cannot usefully contribute to genomic prediction. This is apparent if one imagines a number of halfsibs with individual marker genotypes and deregressed PA EBV. These animals cannot add any information beyond what would be available from the common parent's genotype and EBV. Second  if any parents are segregating a major effect  about half the offspring will inherit the favourable allele and the others will inherit the unfavourable allele. However  the EBV of both kinds of offspring will be shrunk towards the parent average. Parent average effects can be eliminated by directly storing the individual and offspring deregressed information and corresponding  during the iterative solution of equations carried out for the purposes of genetic evaluation []. In some cases researchers do not have access to the evaluation system used to create the EBV on their training populations. In those circumstances  it is necessary to approximate the evaluation equations and backsolve for deregressed information free of the effects of parent average. This can be done for one training animal at a time  given  and knowledge of only the EBV (unadjusted for the base) and  on the animal  its sire and its dam. First  compute parent average (PA) EBV and reliability for animal  with  and  as parents:   and . Assuming sire and dam are unrelated and not inbred  the additive genetic covariance matrix for PA and offspring is  with inverse . Using this result  recognise that the equations to be solved are: where  is information equivalent to a right-hand-side element pertaining to the individual   and  reflects the unknown information content of the parent average and individual (plus information from any of its offspring and/or subsequent generations)   = (1 - )/ is assumed known. Define then using the facts [] that  and  leads to   and . Rearranging these equations    and . The formula to derive the inverse of a 2 × 2 matrix applied to the coefficient matrix from (11) gives   and  for . Equating these alternative expressions for leads to and equating the expressions for leads to Second  solve these nonlinear equations for  and . Although not obvious  there is a direct solution for  and . It can be derived by dividing (12) by (13)  defining   and rearranging to get Substituting the expression for  in (14) into the denominator of (13)  defining   and rearranging leads to a quadratic expression in   namely   which has a positive root that can rearranged to Application of (15) provides the solution for  that can be substituted in (14) to solve for   together enabling reconstruction of the coefficient matrix of (11). Third  the right-hand side of (11) can be formed by multiplying the now known coefficient matrix by the known vector of EBV for PA and individual. The right-hand side on the individual  free of PA effects is  The equation to obtain an estimate of EBV for animal   free of its parent average    based only on   is  and the corresponding  for use in constructing the weights in (10) is given by . The deregressed information is   which simplifies to  and is analogous to an average. An iterative procedure using mixed model equations to simultaneously deregress all the sires in a pedigree  while jointly estimating the base adjustment and accounting for group effects was given by Jairath et al []. However  that method requires knowledge on the numbers of offspring of each sire. Genetic evaluation of animal populations results in EBV that are a weighted function of the parent average EBV  any information on the individual  adjusted for fixed effects  and a weighted function of the EBV of offspring  adjusted for the merit of the mates []. The previous section has argued for the removal of parent average effects in constructing information for genomic analyses. It could be argued that information from genotyped descendants should also be removed to avoid double counting. This can be achieved during the evaluation process  and is desirable in the absence of selection. If the genotyped descendants are a selected subset  the removal of their information will lead to biased information on the individual. Simulation suggests that the double counting of descendants performance has negligible impact on genomic predictions (results not shown). Comparative weights for individual and average of  individual observations using (5)  and for progeny means of  halfsibs using (6) and deregressed EBV of varying reliability using (10) are in Table . Suppose genomic training is to be undertaken for a trait using EBV available from national evaluations that have yet to be deregressed. Widely-used bulls have been genotyped and the EBV and  of those bulls are available  along with corresponding information on the sire and dam of each bull. Such a trio might have values of  = 10   = 0.97;  = 2   = 0.36; and  = 15   = 0.68. Given  = 0.25   = 0.75/0.25 = 3  the PA information is   and . Using (15)  with  = 5.97   = 0.523  then  = 9.16 which substituted in (14) gives  = 5.08. Substituting these information contents into the coefficient matrix or left-hand side of (11) is  with inverse . These values correspond to  = 0.5 - 3 × 0.0558 = 0.33 and  = 1.0 - 3 × 0.1066 = 0.68 the reported  and  confirming the equations used to determine the information content. The right-hand side of (11) can then be reconstructed by multiplying the coefficient matrix by the vector of EBV as . The element of interest is the right-hand side element corresponding to the individual  obtained as  = -6 × 6 + 11.08 × 15 = 130. The deregressed information for use in subsequent analysis is obtained as  and the corresponding reliability of this information free of PA effects is  = 1.0 - 3/(5.08 + 3) = 0.63. The relevant scaled weight for use with the deregressed information on this individual assuming  = 0.5 can be found using (10) as . This implies that the deregressed information is 2.76 times more valuable than a single record on the individual. The relative value of alternative information sources varies according to   the parameter that reflects the ability of the genotypic covariates to predict genetic merit. Genomic prediction models that fit well have small values for  and result in greater relative emphasis of reliable information than is the case when the genomic prediction model fits poorly and the residual variation is dominated by contributions from lack-of-fit. For example  the mean of 20 halfsib progeny has about 3.6 times the value of the mean of 5 progeny when  is 0.1  and 2.5 times the value when  is 0.8. Deregressed EBV with reliability 1.0 are 11 times as valuable as reliability 0.5 when  is 0.1 but only 3 times as valuable when  is 0.5. These results indicate that collecting genotypes and phenotypes on training animals with low to moderate reliability will be of more relative value to genomic predictions that account for only 50% genetic variation (i.e. correlation 0.7 between genomic prediction and real merit) than they will for genomic predictions that account for a high proportion of variance. The impact of the assumed  is to influence the relative value of individuals with reliable information  such as progeny test results  in comparison to individuals with information from less reliable sources  such as individual records. The use of too large a value of  will result in overemphasis of less accurate information in relation to more accurate information. The use of too small a value of  will result in too little emphasis on less accurate records. The correct value of  will not be known prior to training analyses but can be estimated from validation analyses. Training analyses could then be repeated using the estimated value of . Alternatively  sensitivity to  could be assessed by training using a range of values. The sensitivity to  varies according to the heterogeneity of information content in the training data. In practice  information sources of phenotypic data on training individuals can vary more widely than the examples derived in this paper. For example  training individuals might have their own and a mix of half-and fullsib progeny observed. In such cases  a practical approach is to first set up the mixed model equations that would be appropriate to estimate breeding values on the training individuals and use these to solve for the deregressed information []. This approach could also be useful in circumstances where training individuals do not all have the appropriate phenotypes. Consider a situation where some individuals have carcass measurements while others have correlated observations such as live animal ultrasound measures. A bivariate analysis of these two traits could be used to produce a single deregressed value for the carcass trait for each animal that accounted for appropriately weighted ultrasound information. The arguments put forward in this manuscript support the use of deregressed information  in agreement with practices adopted by many researchers []. The weighting factors proposed in this paper differ from any reported in the literature except when the parameter  = 0 in which cases the weights are effectively the same as those used by Georges et al. [] and Spelman et al. []. In practice  the benefit of deregression and the subsequent weighting of alternative information sources will depend on the extent to which the number of repeat records  number of progeny and/or  varies among individuals in the training population.

Although we cannot infer causality in these relationships  these results suggest a role for using some immune traits  particularly CD11R1 cells or AGP concentrations  as predictors of pig performance under the lower health status conditions associated with commercial farms. The control of infection represents a major challenge to the pig industry. Over the last decade  this challenge has become greater due to the spread of viral infections such as PMWS (post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome)  PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) and enzootic pneumonia. In addition to the impact of these infections or diseases upon pig morbidity and mortality  they can also affect pig health by increasing susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections [–]. Since antibiotics and bio-security control measures can only partially control infection  and effective vaccines are not always available  it would be advantageous to find a method of selecting pigs with increased resistance to a wide range of infectious diseases or an increased ability to maintain high performance levels in the face of disease pressure. In pig breeding companies  pigs are generally selected for improved performance within the high health status environment of a nucleus farm  but often their progeny are reared within a lower health status environment and  as a result  their performance may be compromised. Hence there is a need to find a way of selecting boars that can produce progeny with an increased resistance to a wide range of infectious diseases so that they are able to perform well under a range of health conditions. In pig production systems it is difficult to select animals directly for disease resistance since the major challenges often differ in different environments and most husbandry practices attempt to minimise exposure to infection. Therefore  an alternative approach is needed. One such approach would be to use measures of innate and adaptive immunity which are heritable and associated with parameters related to health and/or performance. In order to predict progeny that will perform equally well in a range of environments  these immune markers would have to be heritable regardless of health status. Previously  we have shown peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte (PBML) subsets to be heritable []. Further  CD11R1 cells  a subset consisting of natural killer (NK) cells and NK T cells  [  ] were also genetically negatively correlated with performance []. It may be hypothesized that this type of association reflects an underlying response to infection  and this result can be explored by comparing the genetic relationship between CD11R1 cells and performance under both high and lower health status environments. Significant genetic relationships with performance under lower health status environments would suggest that they can be used as biomarkers for health or performance in such environments. We still need to satisfactorily quantify the effect of health status on the properties of these immune traits  particularly their heritabilities and correlations with performance. Added insight into the utility of measuring the PBML subsets may also be gained by refining their definitions. For example  in our previous study []  we did not account for the presence of the different CD8a subsets that are unique to pig PBML. In addition to classical CD8aß cells  these subsets include CD4CD8a cells  CD8a <U+03B3>d T cells and CD8a NK cells []. In particular  CD4 CD8a cells have been suggested to be memory CD4 helper cells [  ] and hence  an important component of the adaptive immune response. It is also possible to distinguish between CD8aß cells and CD8aa subsets on the basis of CD8a expression since CD8aß cells express higher levels of CD8 antigen compared to CD8aa cells []. Further PBML subsets of importance that we can define include CD14 and CD16 cells. Within pig PBML  CD16 is expressed on NK cells and monocytes [    ] whilst  in pigs  CD14 is a marker of monocyte differentiation []. Lastly  CD11R1 cells may be sub-divided into CD8a and CD8a subsets since these cell subsets differ according to cell size  complexity and phenotype [] (Clapperton  unpublished observations). In addition to PBML subsets  we have also reported that acute phase proteins (APP) have a negative phenotypic correlation with daily weight gain and food efficiency []. One possible interpretation of this effect is that sub-clinical infection simultaneously leads to both decreased weight gain and food efficiency and increased APP levels. This study [] also found pig line differences in the levels of the acute phase protein  alpha- acid glycoprotein  which suggested that APP levels may also be under genetic control. APP such as haptoglobin  transthyretin  alpha- acid glycoprotein (AGP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have also been shown to act as potential indicators of animal and farm health status [–]. Therefore  these APP may be valuable as genetic predictors of pig health  the hypothesis being that low APP values predict increased performance as a result of lower levels of infection in selected offspring. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of PBML and APP measurements  and their genetic relationships with performance  extending our previous results []. In particular  we provide the first estimates of heritability for all APP that were measured and the newly defined PBML. Importantly  by substantially increasing the size of our dataset we can also compare the heritabilities of a large range of immune traits  and their associations with performance  between high and lower health status environments. These results should indicate the extent to which host genotype influences both the basal levels of these traits and their levels in response to exposure to pathogens. Measurements were performed on pigs sampled from seven farms labelled A to G. Details of numbers of pigs tested per farm along with the number of sires and full-sib families (i.e. litters) are shown in Table . All pigs tested were apparently healthy with no clinical signs of infection. Farm G represented the Roslin Institute farm whilst farms A to F represented farms from one of the three pig breeding companies (sources 1-3) who contributed animals to the study and are cited in the acknowledgements. In all cases  sows were reared on the same farm as the offspring. After birth  the offspring remained with their dams until age four weeks  whereupon they were weaned and transferred to flat deck pens and kept in groups of 28-20. At start of test (ca. 10-13 weeks of age)  animals were split into groups (less than 20 animals) until end of test  except for Farm G where animals were housed in individual pens. All animals were housed in straw bed pens. There was variation between farms with respect to the type of buildings used and ventilation. Farms A  B and C were classified as specific pathogen-free (SPF)  i.e. free of all major swine pathogens whilst farms D  E  F and G were classified as non-SPF. Farms D-G were free of all major swine pathogens  as determined by clinical examination and serology tests  except for the following: Farm D was tested positive for enzootic pneumonia () on the basis of serology and clinical signs  and Farms E and F were positive for porcine multi-wasting syndrome (PMWS) on the basis of clinical signs. Farm G was positive for  and also   phage type 104 was detected in faecal samples from this farm. A detailed breakdown of the collected data is given in Table . Data from sources 1-3 were split into three generations  G1  G2 and GX. A small number of sires were selected from G1 by the breeding companies on performance attributes and used to produce progeny (G2) using unrelated dams on the same farm. Immune traits were measured in all G1 animals and a sample of G2 animals chosen at random  whilst performance was measured in all G1 and G2 animals. The G2 pigs located on both the SPF and non-SPF farms at source 2 were progeny of the same sires. Generation GX animals comprised populations from the same breeding companies/lines as G1 or G2; however their data (immune measures and performance) were collected three or more years later  and genetic relationships between GX and G1 or G2 were sparse and not included in the analyses. In general  different pig breed-lines were used on different farms  except on farms B and E  and C and F where common lines were used. Also Farm F comprised Landrace as well as Large White pigs. Approximately equal numbers of males and females were measured. Animals were blood sampled at end of test (ca. 90 kg) by collecting blood via the external jugular vein into a tube containing EDTA or acid citrate dextrose anti-coagulant for leucocyte subset measurements and a tube containing lithium heparin for acute phase protein measurements. Sampling was staggered so that pigs were tested in weekly groups of 20 to 30 pigs in all farms except Farm G. Sampling for each farm was completed within a period of 3 to 8 weeks except for Farm G where sampling was performed on groups of 6-8 pigs over a twelve month period. The liveweights obtained at the start of test (ca. 30 kg) and at the end of test were retained in this dataset and used to calculate average daily gain for both blood sampled animals and their non-sampled littermates. All procedures performed on the animals tested in this study were approved by the relevant government authorities responsible for animal welfare. Leucocyte subset measurements and the storage of plasma samples for acute phase protein measurements occurred within 72 h after blood collection. During this time  blood was stored at room temperature. Total and differential white blood cell counts (WBC) were measured as described previously []. The proportions of different peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte (PBML) subsets were measured as described previously []  using flow cytometry and primary monoclonal antibodies that recognized cell surface markers for CD4  CD8a  gamma delta (<U+03B3>d) T cell receptor  immunoglobulin light chain (B cell marker)  CD11R1 (NK cell marker) and SIRPa (monocyte marker). In addition  we added markers for CD14 monocytes (clone MIL-2; []) and CD16 cells (clone G7; [  ]). Our measurements also incorporated the following CD8a subsets - CD4 CD8a cells and CD4CD8a cells  CD11R1CD8a and CD11R1CD8a cells. CD8a cells sub-divide into two clearly distinct subsets based upon the intensity of staining for CD8a  into 'bright' and 'dim' populations as previously described []. CD8a 'bright' cells were CD8a cells with high intensity of expression for CD8a  and CD8a 'dim' cells were CD8a cells with low intensity of expression for CD8a. The antigen density for both the different CD8a populations and for the CD8ß population was calculated using Qifikit beads (Dako Cytomation  Ely  Cambridgeshire) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma from a 5 mL blood sample was used for the measurement of the acute phase proteins  viz. AGP  haptoglobin  CRP and transthyretin. Plasma was collected from each blood sample after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and then decanted into a polypropylene tube and stored at -20°C. AGP was measured using a commercial kit based on a radial immuno-diffusion assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (The Metabolic Institute  Tokyo  Japan). Transthyretin and CRP were measured using an ELISA as described previously [  ]. The concentration of haptoglobin was derived from its haemoglobin binding activity  as described by Eckersall . (1999) []. Traits selected for analysis were average daily gain and the following immune traits  total and differential WBC count  proportions of PBML subsets and APP levels. PBML subset proportions included CD8a cells  CD11R1 cells (CD8a and CD8a subsets)  CD4 T cells (CD8a and CD8a subsets)  <U+03B3>d T cells  B cells  monocytes (SIRPa cells)  CD14 cells (monocyte subset) and CD16 cells (NK cells and monocytes) and APP included AGP  haptoglobin  CRP and transthyretin. An initial analysis of the data was performed using GENSTAT [] to determine significant fixed effects and to characterize the data. Since the distributions of most traits were skewed to the right  log transformations were required to normalise the data for these traits prior to analysis. The proportions of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells were instead square root transformed. Significant fixed effects for most traits included farm  generation and genetic line nested within farm  sex and age at blood sampling. For the non-SPF animals  disease status was confounded with farm  i.e. different farms had different diseases  and Farm F had Landrace as well as LW pigs. Genetic parameters and their standard errors were estimated using the AS-REML package []  fitting an animal model including all known pedigree relationships. Each trait was fitted against the fixed effects described above and the random effects fitted in all analyses were the residual term  the effect of pen plus the direct genetic effect. For one trait (transthyretin) a general maternal effect  which could contain both genetic and environmental (litter) effects  was also significant and fitted. Uni-variate and bi-variate analyses were performed for each trait described above using all available data for each trait from all animals shown in Table   i.e. including animals with performance data but no immune measurements as well as those with both sets of data. The uni-variate and bi-variate analyses for each trait were then repeated using data from either only SPF and non-SPF farms. Uni-variate analyses were performed for all traits  bi-variate analyses were targeted at specific hypotheses. In order to test whether differences in heritability estimates between SPF and non-SPF conditions were significant  a t value was estimated as: Table  shows the details of the numbers of pigs tested along with the number of generations  genetic lines and pedigree details for each farm. Table  summarises the data for all immune and performance traits tested within each type of environment. Health status did not affect either the mean values or the variances for any of the traits tested with the exception of AGP  which was lower under non-SPF conditions than SPF conditions (p < 0.01). This difference could have been caused by differences in either health status or line  as these factors were confounded in the dataset. Estimated heritabilities obtained using the entire dataset are shown in Table   for all measured traits. Overall  most of the traits tested were moderately to highly heritable and significantly different from zero (p < 0.05). In particular  classical cytotoxic CD8aß cells and the CD4 subsets were both highly heritable  with values ranging from 0.37 to 0.75. The expression of CD8a and CD8ß antigens were also highly heritable  ranging from 0.73 to 0.93. However  for CD16 cells  the heritability was low and not significantly different from zero (h (s.e.) 0.09 (0.08)). For acute phase protein transthyretin  there was a strong maternal effect which  if not fitted  resulted in an inflated heritability estimate (data not shown). For some traits  the variation contributed by the local environment  represented by the effect of pen  was also significant (Table ). In Tables  and   the effects of health status on the direct heritability of immune and performance traits along with the genetic and residual variances are shown. The effect of pen was also fitted to all traits  and is shown in cases where it is significant. Because differences in estimated heritabilities may be due to changes in either the genetic or environmental variance  both of these variance components are also presented. There is a tendency for the transition from a high to a lower health status to be associated with a decrease in heritability  and this change tended to be more associated with a decrease in the genetic variance than an increase in the residual variance. The residual variance was often relatively stable particularly for the acute phase proteins. Notably  the proportions of CD11R1 cells and CD16 cells were moderately heritable under SPF conditions (h (s.e.) 0.46 (0.12)) but lowly heritable under non-SPF conditions (h (s.e.) 0.07 (0.08))  although for CD11R1 cells the local environmental effect  i.e. the pen variance  appeared to be high compared to the average pen variance for other traits. When the pen effect was not fitted  the estimated heritability for this measurement was 0.36 (0.14). When the variance for 'pen' was fixed to be the same as for SPF pigs  the estimated heritability (± se) for this measurement was 0.29 (0.14). However  the opposite trend was observed for some traits  viz. the proportions of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells  CD14 cells and CD8a cells. For these traits  a lower health status environment was associated with higher genetic variance and this difference was significant for CD14 cells (p < 0.05). Indeed  under SPF conditions  the heritability estimates were not significantly different from zero for the proportions of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells and CD14 cells  but there was a strong pen effect for mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells within SPF conditions. These two traits will be correlated with each other since the composite of the two traits is equal to one hundred percent. CD4 and CD4CD8 cells are also somewhat  albeit not significantly  more heritable under SPF conditions (h for SPF and non-SPF conditions were 0.78 and 0.57 for CD4 cells and 0.82 and 0.45 for CD4CD8 cells). Indeed the CD4CD8 subset under SPF conditions had the highest heritability of all. Heritabilities for CD8 antigen density measurements were similar under both SPF and non-SPF conditions (data not shown). Heritability estimates for the proportion of monocytes and acute phase protein  AGP were unaffected by health status. Further  the health status environment did not affect the maternal effect associated with transthyretin (0.24 (0.11) for SPF conditions  and 0.24 (0.10) for non-SPF conditions). Heritability estimates for average daily gain were lower under non-SPF conditions compared to SPF conditions (p < 0.01)  due to both lower genetic variance and increased residual variance. To explore possible effects of the allocation of different genetic lines to different farms  the data were reanalyzed using only progeny derived from the same sires from sources 2 and 3 (see Table )  which were equally distributed between SPF and non-SPF farms. Each source was made up of a single genetic line. Within this subset  the same result was observed as for the whole dataset  i.e. heritability estimates for average daily gain were lower under non-SPF than SPF conditions (p < 0.05) (data not shown). Since the initial weight (start weight) had a significant effect upon some of the traits  e.g. AGP  uni-variate analyses for each trait were repeated with this factor fitted as an extra covariate; however this did not affect the heritability estimates (data not shown). The effect of health status upon the relationship between immune traits and average daily gain is shown in Table . Most of the genetic correlations between immune traits and average daily gain that were significantly different from zero were negative  i.e. decreasing average daily gain was associated with increasing values of a particular immune trait. In particular  there were negative genetic correlations between average daily gain and the proportions of CD11R1 cells  monocytes  the acute phase protein  AGP. There was a strong negative genetic correlation between the proportions of CD11R1 cells and average daily gain under non-SPF conditions but this relationship was absent under SPF conditions. There were also weak negative phenotypic correlations between these two traits under both SPF and non-SPF conditions. For the proportions of monocytes  there were negative genetic and phenotypic correlations between this trait and average daily gain under SPF conditions but not under non-SPF conditions. There were negative genetic and phenotypic correlations between AGP and average daily gain under both types of environment. Although there were apparently high genetic correlations between other immune traits and weight gain  e.g. WBC and weight gain under non-SPF conditions  these were not significantly different from zero (p > 0.05). There was a negative phenotypic correlation between haptoglobin and average daily gain  and a weak positive phenotypic correlation between the proportions of <U+03B3>d T cells and average daily gain  with neither of these correlations being affected by health status. There were weak negative correlations between average daily gain and the proportion of PMN leucocytes under non-SPF conditions and between CD14 cells and average daily gain under SPF conditions only. The analysis was repeated for each set of traits with the initial weight included as an extra covariate. This extra fixed effect did not affect the genetic or phenotypic relationship between any of the immune traits tested and average daily gain except for the correlations with the proportions of CD11R1 cells and AGP under non-SPF conditions  and the correlation with the proportions of monocytes under SPF conditions. Adding the initial weight as an extra fixed effect caused the genetic correlation (r (se)) between CD11R1 cells and average daily gain to increase from -0.68 (0.29) to -0.99 (0.23)  and the genetic correlation between AGP and average daily gain to increase from -0.72 (0.22) to -0.92 (0.22). Adding the initial weight as an extra covariate also caused the genetic correlation of average daily gain with the number of monocytes to decrease from -0.46 (0.23) to -0.36 (0.19) and this effect was then no longer significant (0.05 < p < 0.1). Phenotypic correlations between acute phase proteins and PBML subsets were mostly weak (r < 0.2) and not significantly different from zero (data not shown). However  some genetic correlations were significantly different from zero  and these correlations were all positive. In summary  there was a positive genetic correlation between the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) and the proportions of B cells (r = 0.80 (s.e. 0.21))  and between the concentration of haptoglobin and either the proportions of monocytes (r = 0.52 (s.e. 0.24)) or the proportions of CD11R1 cells (r = 0.53 (s.e. 0.21)). Nearly all genetic and phenotypic correlations between different PBML subsets were not statistically significant from zero except there were strong genetic and phenotypic correlations between pairs of subsets where one subset was part of the other subset e.g. CD4 and CD4CD8a cells (data not shown). It is essential that markers for increased resistance to infectious disease can be transmitted across generations  i.e. are heritable. Although we have previously estimated the heritability of a range of peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte subsets and their correlations with performance  we had not yet been able to robustly examine the influence of health status upon these parameters []. Our current dataset comprised animals that were previously tested [] along with additional animals from farms that varied in health status. This data also included additional immune traits such as CD8a cell subsets and acute phase proteins  AGP  haptoglobin  CRP and transthyretin. Overall  most of the immune traits tested were found to be moderately heritable across the dataset as a whole and these heritabilities  combined with the observed trait variability  would permit selection for altered trait values. Estimated heritabilities for total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts and the acute phase protein  haptoglobin are similar to those quoted by other workers [] (Diack (unpublished observations)). Our heritability estimates for total and differential white blood cell counts were within the range of those published by Edfors-Lilja . (1994) and Henryon . (2006) [  ]. Additionally  we were able to provide some novel heritability estimates. For example  unlike humans and other species  pigs possess high proportions of CD4CD8a cells and we have provided the first evidence that these subsets are heritable. This is arguably unsurprising because these cells are a subset of total CD4 cells which are also highly heritable  and a high genetic correlation was observed between CD4CD8a cells and CD4 cells. There was an unexplained maternal effect associated with the acute phase protein  transthyretin which might not necessarily be immune-related. Transthyretin mainly acts as a carrier protein for thyroxine and retinol (vitamin A) []. It is also a marker for nutritional status and is usually maintained at high levels except during infection and malnutrition  when it drops [  ]. Maternal influences such as maternal stress or nutrition have been shown to influence transthyretin levels in the off-spring [  ]  and these effects may well explain our observed maternal effect. Most immune traits were heritable regardless of health status although some immune traits  e.g. the proportions of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells and CD14 cells  were only observed to be heritable within a lower health status environment. This is possibly because genetic differences are more fully expressed for this particular trait when there are environmental or pathogen challenges. In our experiments  monocytes were all SIRPa but only a proportion of them were CD14 and  unlike for CD14 cells  health status did not affect the heritability of monocytes. Pig peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population  both with respect to function and phenotype and  in pigs  CD14 cells have been suggested to represent a more mature population of monocytes [  ]. In contrast  other work has shown that exposure to viral or bacterial pathogens can influence the expression of CD14 on porcine alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells [  ]. Thus  there might be a stronger genetic influence upon either monocyte differentiation or the expression of CD14 in response to the environmental pathogens present within the lower health status environment. Ideally  markers for increased resistance to infectious disease should correlate (within a herd) with indicators of health  such as performance  morbidity or mortality. Previous work by ourselves and others  has demonstrated negative phenotypic and genetic relationships between some immune traits and weight gain [      ]. This study confirms and extends these earlier findings. This type of association could reflect a response to sub-clinical infection that increases the proliferation of certain immune cell types and/or the production of acute phase proteins  with a reduction in growth being a consequence of infection. The traits that were most strongly and consistently associated with weight gain included the proportions of CD11R1 cells and monocytes and acute phase proteins  AGP and haptoglobin. There were also negative genetic correlations between average daily gain and immune traits  total CD11R1 cells  monocytes and AGP. For total CD11R1 cells  this effect was only detectable under non-SPF conditions. The cell marker CD11R1 is mainly expressed by NK cells [  ] which are one of the major defences against intra-cellular pathogens []. Since the main pathogens present on the non-SPF farms were intra-cellular pathogens  e.g. pig circovirus (PCV) and   then the genetic association between CD11R1 cells and weight gain may reflect a response to sub-clinical infection. This effect is reinforced by the observation that correcting for starting weight strengthened the correlation of average daily gain with CD11R1 cells. This  under this type of non-SPF environment  CD11R1 cells could act as an indicator for sub-clinical infection. For monocytes  the genetic relationship between weight gain and this cell type was only evident under SPF conditions. We cannot fully explain this effect. One major difference between the SPF and non-SPF animals was that many of the non-SPF animals came from farms that were positive for PMWS. PCV is one of the main agents associated with PMWS and this virus only appears to infect monocyte/macrophage cell types [  ]. If viral infection prevented these cell types from proliferating in response to infection  then this could have affected the relationship between these cell types and weight gain under non-SPF conditions. Unlike CD11R1 cells  health status did not affect the genetic and phenotypic relationships between AGP and weight gain  which might indicate that this is a more reliable indicator for selection purposes. As with other APP  infection can increase the production of AGP through cytokines TNF a  IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines can also reduce growth by inducing anorexia and tissue breakdown [–]. Since AGP concentrations remain raised for longer after infection than other acute phase proteins such as CRP and haptoglobin  AGP has been used as a marker of sub-clinical infection in large scale human studies [  ]. In contrast  an alternative view is the lack of any impact of health status on the relationship between AGP and weight gain might indicate that the association between AGP and weight gain is not due to an underlying response to infection  since AGP is also a constitutive protein. High plasma AGP concentrations are present after birth and gradually decrease with age [  ]. One argument against this view is that the expression of higher levels of AGP has been associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory effects which can influence the outcome of infection and inflammation [  ]. In one study  higher constitutive levels of AGP present in transgenic mice were associated with higher levels of weight loss and inflammation in response to inflammatory bowel disease compared to wild-type mice []. An analogous situation may exist in pigs where animals with higher constitutive serum AGP concentrations are more susceptible to pro-inflammatory tissue damage due to infection  which may lead to reduced weight gain. This hypothesis could be tested by monitoring AGP and weight gain in response to direct challenge or disease outbreak  or by looking for genes that influence both plasma AGP levels and weight gain. One limitation of this study was that health status was confounded with farm (i.e. housing and environment)  although husbandry methods were similar between farms. We attempted to minimise the impact of this confounding by statistically accounting for farm in our models  by placing little importance on mean trait values  as these could differ for many reasons  but concentrating instead on genetic variation and relationships between variables. Performing larger studies on a single farm would enable us to select genetic parameters that could be applied to specific health status situations. However  the generality of our results would be reduced  as we wish to find parameters that are robust across a wide range of health environments. Overall  we have shown that for a wide range of immune traits  heritabilities were generally unaffected by health status  although genetic correlations between performance and CD11R1 cells or monocytes  were influenced by health status. There were strong genetic and phenotypic correlations between AGP and performance  and health status did not affect the strength of these relationships  however the genetic association between CD11R1 cells and average daily gain was only present under lower health status conditions. In order to effectively select for higher performing animals using either of these measurements  we need to fully understand the underlying mechanisms that control the relationship between these traits and weight gain. Also  the relationship of these immune traits with other immune traits needs to be fully understood to avoid any antagonistic effects. For CD11R1 cells  we also need to know the genetic correlations between different health status environments. Future use of these biomarkers may be conditional on further studies addressing the implications for complex immune traits of selecting on single markers. In this context  future work should focus on finding genetic markers that are linked to both innate and adaptive immunity and performance  since such markers would be independent of changes in health status and they would avoid logistical issues associated with measurement of phenotypes. antigen alpha- acid glycoprotein acute phase protein C-reactive protein ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay interleukin-1 interleukin-6 Landrace Large White mononuclear leucocytes natural killer non specific pathogen-free specific pathogen-free peripheral blood mononuclear leucocyte subsets pig circovirus polymorphonuclear leucocytes porcine multi-wasting syndrome signal regulatory protein a tumour necrosis factor alpha transthyretin porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome white blood cell Zimmerman JJ  Yoon KJ  Wills RW  Swenson SL: General overview of PRRSV: a perspective from the United States.

Hence  these markers mainly explain polygenic effects rather than QTL effects. However  if a polygenic effect is included in a Bayesian model  it is expected that the estimated effect of these markers will be more persistent over generations without having to re-estimate the marker effects every generation and will result in increased accuracy and reduced bias.MethodsGenomic selection using the Bayesian method  'BayesB' was evaluated for different marker densities when a polygenic effect is included (GWpEBV) and not included (GWEBV) in the model. Linkage disequilibrium and a mutation drift balance were obtained by simulating a population with a Ne of 100 over 1 000 generations.ResultsAccuracy of selection was slightly higher for the model including a polygenic effect than for the model not including a polygenic effect whatever the marker density. The accuracy decreased in later generations  and this reduction was stronger for lower marker densities. However  no significant difference in accuracy was observed between the two models. The linear regression of TBV on GWEBV and GWpEBV was used as a measure of bias.

Hence  these markers mainly explain polygenic effects rather than QTL effects. However  if a polygenic effect is included in a Bayesian model  it is expected that the estimated effect of these markers will be more persistent over generations without having to re-estimate the marker effects every generation and will result in increased accuracy and reduced bias. Genomic selection using the Bayesian method  'BayesB' was evaluated for different marker densities when a polygenic effect is included (GWpEBV) and not included (GWEBV) in the model. Linkage disequilibrium and a mutation drift balance were obtained by simulating a population with a Ne of 100 over 1 000 generations. Accuracy of selection was slightly higher for the model including a polygenic effect than for the model not including a polygenic effect whatever the marker density. The accuracy decreased in later generations  and this reduction was stronger for lower marker densities. However  no significant difference in accuracy was observed between the two models. The linear regression of TBV on GWEBV and GWpEBV was used as a measure of bias. The regression coefficient was more stable over generations when a polygenic effect was included in the model  and was always between 0.98 and 1.00 for the highest marker density. The regression coefficient decreased more quickly with decreasing marker density. Including a polygenic effect had no impact on the selection accuracy  but showed reduced bias  which is especially important when estimates of genome-wide markers are used to estimate breeding values over more than one generation. High-throughput genotyping and availability of dense marker information have made prediction of breeding values based on dense marker genotyping possible resulting in so-called genome-wide breeding values (GWEBV). Several methods have been suggested to estimate marker effects in the prediction of GWEBV e.g. [–]. The advantage of selecting parents on GWEBV in genomic selection schemes is the potential to select candidates with high accuracy and low bias directly by using marker genotypes or haplotypes only. Several simulation studies in which markers were calibrated on a training set of phenotypes e.g. [–] have demonstrated these advantages. GWEBV may reduce the amount of phenotyping required for breeding schemes and hence constitute an attractive proposition because obtaining phenotypic records routinely for all generations can be expensive  reduce animal welfare  and sometimes impossible for live selection candidates. An example for which all three issues apply is in fish aquaculture where selecting disease resistance is done by challenging sibs of the candidates with the disease to avoid infecting the selection candidates []. Genomic selection selects animals directly on the genotype  rather than the phenotype which may be an advantage  especially for traits that cannot be measured or are expensive to record on selection candidates (e.g. slaughter traits and challenge-test data). Successful implementation of genomic selection relies on some underlying assumptions. One assumption is the existence of population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL). As a result of imperfect LD  markers in LD with the QTL are not likely to explain all existing genetic variation  and the remaining genetic variation will be included in the polygenic variance. For sparse marker maps  linkage disequilibrium between the markers and the QTL will be reduced and only part of the genetic variance will be explained by the markers. Furthermore  estimated marker effects may model family relationships []  which will result in spurious associations between phenotypes and marker alleles  i.e. there will be non-zero marker effects whilst the marker alleles are not linked to any causative QTL. It is expected that such marker-QTL associations decay at a rate of (1-)  where  is the distance between marker and QTL and  is the number of generations []. For spurious associations   = 0.5  and for tightly linked markers   < 0.01. Thus  spurious associations decay much more rapidly than associations based on real linkage over time. This introduces the important issue of the persistence of GWEBV predictions over generations in the absence of marker effects re-estimation  and few studies have examined this issue  e.g. []. One solution that may address both issues is to include a polygenic effect in the model and this has been addressed by others  e.g. [    ]  but not evaluated over multiple generations. Our hypothesis is that these spurious associations are better represented by a polygenic effect in the model than by markers that happen to have a higher frequency in some families compared to others. Thus it is expected that including a polygenic effect will capture genetic variation that is not in tight linkage with markers  such that this variation is to a lesser extent captured by markers through spurious associations. The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the effect of including a polygenic effect into a Bayesian model for the estimation of marker estimates to predict GWEBV  and their accuracy and bias over multiple generations to study their persistence over time. Details of the simulation model have been described in an earlier paper []. Briefly  a population with an effective population size of Ne = 100 was simulated over 1000 generations of random mating  random selection and with a genome subject to mutation. In generation  = 1001  the number of animals was increased to 1000 by factorial mating of 50 sires (i = 1-50) and 50 dams (i = 51-100) from generation  = 1000. The factorial mating was achieved by mating sire 1 to dams 51-70  sire 2 to dams 52-71  sire 3 to dams 53-72 and so on  and each dam had one offspring per sire. In descending generations ( = 1002 to  = 1006)  the animals had 1000 offspring produced by random sampling with replacement among the parents selected from the previous generation. The size and structure of the genome were the same as described in []. The genome (10 Morgan) was simulated with 10 chromosomes each 100 cM long. Four density schemes were evaluated  and the density was scaled by the effective population size (Ne) used to generate the markers  which was Ne = 100 and a genome size in Morgan (M). Scaled marker densities were 1  2  4 and 8 Ne/M  which corresponded here to 100  200  400 and 800 markers per Morgan. Mendelian inheritance and the Haldane mapping function were assumed for all loci. The mutation rate of the markers was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 per locus per meiosis. With this mutation rate  99% of the potential markers were segregating at  = 1001. Markers with more than two alleles segregating at  = 1001 were converted to bi-allelic SNP markers by ignoring some of the mutations as described in []. The minor allele frequencies of the SNP markers showed approximately a uniform distribution with an over-representation of marker alleles with intermediate frequencies  which in practice may reflect the effect of pre-screening SNP markers and selecting the most informative. The potential number of QTL was kept at 100 per chromosome  distributed evenly over each chromosome. The actual number of segregating QTL at  = 1001 depended on the mutation rate which was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 per locus per meiosis. The resulting number of segregating QTL was typically 5 to 6% of the potential number. The additive effect of a mutational allele of the multi-allelic QTL was sampled from the gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.4 and scale parameter of 1.66 [] with an equal probability of a positive or negative effect. No polygenic effect was simulated. The true breeding value (TBV) of animal  from generation 1001-1006 was calculated as: where  is a vector of true QTL effects of the QTL alleles at locus   and  is an incidence row vector indicating for animal  which of the QTL alleles it carried at locus  (e.g. Q = [1 1 0 ..]' for animal  carrying QTL alleles 1 and 2 at locus ); N is the number of QTL loci. For generation 1001  phenotypic values for each animal were simulated as: y = TBV + e  where e ~ N(0  s). The variance of the TBV effects (s) varied somewhat from replicate to replicate  but was on average 1.0 (s.e. = 0.118). The environmental variance (s) was set equal to s such that the heritability was 0.5 for every replicate. The 'BayesB' method of Meuwissen . [] was used to estimate the effects of the SNP markers for the 1000 animals in generation  = 1001. The 'BayesB' model is described in more detail in earlier papers [] and []  but briefly  the variance of the marker effects (s) was estimated for every marker using a relevant prior distribution which was a mixture of an inverted chi-squared distribution and a discrete probability mass at s = 0. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was used to sample s from its distribution conditional on *  (s | *)  where * denotes the data  corrected for the mean and all other genetic effects except the marker effect () []. Given s  marker effects   were sampled from a Normal distribution as prior and using Gibbs sampling []. The 'BayesB' model was extended to include a polygenic effect (): where  is the vector of phenotypes  µ is the overall mean   is the vector of polygenic effects   is the summation over all marker loci from 1 to   where  is varying from 1010 marker loci for the lowest marker density (1Ne/M) to 8080 marker loci for the highest marker density (8Ne/M).  is a design matrix for the 'th marker   is the vector of the 'th marker effect and  is the residual term. Dimension of the   and  vectors are 1000 × 1  the  matrix varies from 1010 × 2 for the lowest marker density up to 8080 × 2 for the highest marker density. The variance of  was Var() =  s  where  (1000 × 1000) is the additive relationship matrix  calculated based on five generations of pedigree from generation  = 996 to  = 1000 using the algorithm of []. Polygenic effects were sampled in the MCMC chain using Gibbs sampling and assuming a prior N(0  s) following []  and s was estimated using a scaled inverted chi-squared prior distribution with -2 degrees of freedom  which implies a non-informative flat prior distribution []. The variance of the marker effect was s  which was estimated for every marker using a mixture distribution as the prior; The probability  depends on the density of the markers  and varies with different marker densities  because with more markers  it becomes less likely for marker  to be required to capture the predictive LD between QTL and markers  i.e.  = 53/(Nloc) where 53 is the expected number of QTL and Nloc is the number of marker loci. Sampling from the posterior distribution of s  was by a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that sampled s from (s | *)  where the prior distribution  (s)  was used as the distribution to suggest updates for the Metropolis Hastings chain []  and * denotes the data  corrected for the mean and all other genetic effects except the marker effect (). The Metropolis Hastings chain was run for 10.000 cycles using a burn-in period of 1000 cycles. Given s  marker effects   were sampled from (g | s) using Gibbs sampling []. Prediction of the GWEBV for the method 'BayesB' without polygenic effect was calculated from: where  denotes the marker genotype of animal  at locus  in generation  = 1002 to  = 1006  and  is the estimate of the marker effects  which was estimated on animals in generation  = 1001. Prediction of the breeding values including the polygenic effect (GWpEBV) for the method 'BayesB' was calculated from: Since no data was recorded after generation  = 1001  the polygenic effect  of animal  in generation  was calculated as  where the subscripts  and  represent the sire and dam of animal   respectively. This formula is valid here because the parents of the next generation were randomly selected and there was no phenotypic data entering the evaluations in later generations  i.e. after generation  = 1001. For each replicate  the mean and median of the Gibbs samples for the polygenic variance were calculated from the final 5000 values of the chain. These values were then averaged over 10 replicates. As a measure of bias we calculated the linear regression coefficient of true breeding values on GWEBV and GWpEBV within each of the five generations from  = 1002 to  = 1006. The correlation coefficients were calculated between the true breeding value and the GWEBV and GWpEBV for all five generations which reflects the accuracy of predicting the genome-wide breeding values. The result is based on the average of 20 replicates for each marker density. Tables  to  show the accuracy of selection and bias for the four marker densities when the polygenic effect (GWEBV) is ignored and when it is included (GWpEBV). For the highest marker density (8Ne/M)  the selection accuracy decreased from 0.875 in generation  = 1002 to 0.842 in generation  = 1006 for GWEBV (Table ). Selection accuracy was higher for GWpEBV than for GWEBV for all generations and this was particularly significant for three out of five generations. The difference in accuracy between the two models varied from 0.008 in generation  = 1002 to 0.014 in generation  = 1006. The decrease in accuracy from one generation to the next was similar for the two models. For both intermediate marker densities  the accuracy of GWpEBV in generation  = 1002 was lower compared to that of GWEBV (p < 0.05)  but after five generations of selection  the accuracy was significantly higher for GWpEBV (Tables  and ) (p < 0.05). For example  for marker density 4Ne/M  the difference in accuracy between GWpEBV and GWEBV was -0.014 in generation  = 1002 and 0.014 after five generations (Table )  indicating that by including a polygenic effect retained greater accuracy over generations. The accuracies for marker density 2 Ne/M are relatively high compared to those for higher marker densities  which may be due to the structure of the marker/QTL map. At a marker density of 2 Ne/M  every SNP is adjacent to a putative QTL  whereas at higher densities a fraction of the SNP is not adjacent to any QTL []. For the lowest marker density (1N/M)  the accuracy was 0.679 in the first generation for GWEBV and reduced to 0.518 in generation  = 1006 (Table ). The use of GWpEBV increased the accuracy from 0.005 in generation  = 1002 to 0.013 in generation  = 1006. In general  when the polygenic effect was included in the model  the accuracy of GWpEBV was reduced in later generations as for GWEBV  but the decrease in accuracy was smaller for GWpEBV  especially for the intermediate marker densities. Figure  illustrates the selection accuracy over five generations for GWpEBV and GWEBV for the highest and lowest marker densities  and the difference in accuracy between the two marker densities increased as the number of generations increased. Figure  clearly shows marginal differences between GWpEBV and GWEBV for the two marker densities  since the lines overlap  and that the accuracy is more stable over generations using a high marker density compared to a low marker density. . Selection accuracy was determined for marker densities of 1Ne/M and 8Ne/M with the polygenic effect included (GWpEBV) or not (GWEBV) in the model; the lines for GWEBV and GWpEBV overlap almost completely  indicating minor differences between the two models. The linear regression coefficient of TBV on GWEBV and GWpEBV was used as a measure of bias for these two selection criteria. Table        show the regression coefficients of TBV on GWEBV and GWpEBV and the difference between the two models. For the highest marker density (8Ne/M)  the regression coefficient for GWEBV was 0.926 in generation  = 1002 and reduced to 0.902 in generation  = 1006 (Table ). The regression coefficient was significantly higher for GWpEBV than for GWEBV for all generations  and the difference between the models varied from 0.058 in generation  = 1002 to 0.079 in generation  = 1006  respectively. Consequently the regression coefficients for GWpEBV were always between 0.98 and 1.00  i.e. showing only a very small bias. The reduction in regression was larger for GWEBV than for GWpEBV  as the regression coefficient for GWpEBV was much more stable over generations. For the intermediate marker densities  the regression coefficients were lower. However  there was a marked interaction between generation and method. For GWpEBV the regression coefficient was smaller than that for GWEBV at generation  = 1002  but increased slightly over generations. In contrast  the regression coefficients for GWEBV decreased steadily over generations (Tables  and ). By generation  = 1006  the difference in regression coefficients between GWEBV and GWpEBV was substantial: 0.095 (s.e. = 0.011) and 0.104 (s.e. = 0.010) for 4Ne/M and 2Ne/M  respectively. For 1Ne/M  both methods showed the same trend i.e. a decreasing regression coefficient  but the rate of decrease was faster for GWEBV. In general  if the polygenic effect was ignored  bias increased from generation  = 1002 to  = 1006 for all four marker densities. However  this bias decreased with increasing marker densities (Table       ). If a polygenic effect was included  the situation was similar  but the bias for all marker densities was more stable over generations  and furthermore decreased for intermediate generations (Table  and ). For marker density 8Ne/M  the regression coefficient remained between 0.98 and 1.00 for all generations. Figure  shows the regression coefficient of TBV on GWEBV and GWpEBV for the highest marker density compared to the lowest marker density  and clearly shows that the regression coefficient is more stable over generations when the marker density is high and a polygenic effect is included. . Table  shows the mean and median of the polygenic variances for the four different marker densities. The estimate of the mean polygenic variance ranged from 0.267 for 1Ne/M to 0.411 for 8 Ne/M with large standard errors. There was no statistically significant difference between the different marker densities  and no statistical evidence of a trend with increasing marker density. The distribution of the values for the Gibbs sampling within a replicate was very large with sporadic extreme values. This prompted us to examine the medians for the Gibbs samples for each replicate  they may be more robust to such outliers; however the picture changed very little. This study shows that including a polygenic effect has little impact on the accuracy of genome-wide EBVs in the generation immediately following phenotyping. However  as the generations progress  the predictions with the polygenic effect retains somewhat greater accuracy. This persistence in accuracy over time is particularly significant for higher marker densities. This is because spurious marker associations arising from the pedigree are reduced  so that the remaining marker associations reflect more truly LD through proximity on the chromosome  which changes more slowly over time. Likewise the bias of the GWpEBV is significantly reduced compared to GWEBV  and the reduction is larger for the lowest marker densities  which displayed the largest bias for GWEBV. With lower marker densities  there are fewer markers around the QTL to explain the effect of the QTL  and the polygenic variance is expected to be more important for providing information for the estimated breeding values. In Calus . []  the accuracy of genomic selection including a polygenic effect was related to linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent markers. For a high heritability trait  they found that including a polygenic effect increased selection accuracy when the r was lower than 0.14  and the benefit of including a polygenic effect increased with reduced r. The latter is consistent with our results in generation  = 1002  which is the only generation that can be compared to this study. In Calus . []  the simulated model was based on a lower number of markers  smaller genome size and did not study the ability to predict GWEBV over multiple generations. The r values were calculated for a very similar dataset in an earlier paper  and were between 0.16 and 0.35 []  which are larger than what Calus . [] reported. As found here  the advantage of including a polygenic effect is more limited in the first generation after estimating marker effects. However  in practical situations  it may be advantageous to estimate the marker effects in one generation (e.g.  due to phenotypic costs)  and use these effects to select animals over multiple generations. Under such circumstances  it would be advantageous to include a polygenic effect since the accuracy will increase and bias decrease. Whilst the accuracy of selection is a primary parameter of interest in animal breeding  the bias is also relevant since it determines the model's ability to predict the genetic progress. When generations are overlapping  individuals with different amounts of information and genetic level need to be compared for selection and biases  which can reduce the accuracies in predicting breeding values. Our results indicate that the polygenic effect did account for some of the variance not captured by the markers. Since estimates of polygenic effects are based on the BLUP theory and will thus show small bias  it may be expected and was found that including a polygenic effect reduces the bias. The estimates of the variance of the polygenic effect increase with increasing marker density (Table )  which is contrary to our expectation that  as marker density increases  the QTL will be more closely modelled by the markers and polygenic effects will become less important. A possible explanation for this result is that the non-linear regression implied by BayesB estimation of marker effects becomes more non-linear as marker density increases (because the fraction of markers with non-zero effect is expected to decrease). The increased non-linearity of the regression implies that small spurious associations will be increasingly regressed back to zero  resulting in more variance being explained by the polygenic effect. Furthermore  on a per marker basis  the spurious associations become smaller  since they are spread over more markers. These reductions in marker effects due to spurious associations may result in an increased variance attributed to the polygenic effect. This explanation implies that the effect of including or excluding a polygenic effect in these Bayesian models may depend on the prior distributions used for the marker effects and the polygenic effect  and different prior distributions may result in different outcomes. Also the number of QTL simulated (50-60) may affect the importance of the polygenic effect. It may be expected that with more QTL  the genetic model will become more like the infinitesimal model and the inclusion of a polygenic effect may be more beneficial. Depending on the cost of genotyping and numbers of markers used  genomic selection programs will be more cost effective if the estimated marker effects could be used over multiple generations. Recombination will occur between the markers and QTL over time  resulting in reduced r and reduction in the accuracy of selection. This study shows that a marker density of 8Ne/M seems sufficient for the estimated marker effects to persist over five generations with minimum bias and only a small reduction in selection accuracy. However  in practice the results will depend on the genetic architecture of the genome and on how similar the simulated parameters used in the study are compared to real genomes. Nevertheless  including a polygenic effect is beneficial for a random mating population when estimated marker effects are used to predict GWEBV over multiple generations  especially with respect to the bias.

In this paper  we describe a peeling based  deterministic  exact algorithm to compute efficiently genotype probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops without recourse to junction-tree methods from graph theory. The efficiency in computing the likelihood by peeling comes from storing intermediate results in multidimensional tables called cutsets. Computing marginal genotype probabilities for individual  requires recomputing the likelihood for each of the possible genotypes of individual . This can be done efficiently by storing intermediate results in two types of cutsets called anterior and posterior cutsets and reusing these intermediate results to compute the likelihood. A small example is used to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed in this paper  and marginal genotype probabilities are computed at a monogenic disease locus for every member in a real cattle pedigree. For monogenic or oligogenic traits  algorithms for efficient likelihood computations have been described for both pedigrees without loops []  and pedigrees with loops [–] Furthermore  efficient algorithms have been developed to draw samples from the joint posterior distribution of genotypes from complex pedigrees [  ]. However  when pedigrees are large with many loops and multiple loci  these sampling methods can become very inefficient  and the J-PCS algorithm was proposed to address this problem []. This algorithm involves a) modifying the pedigree by cutting some loops and b) sampling the genotype of an individual  that is as distant as possible from the modifications (\"cuts\"). This sample must be drawn from the marginal posterior genotype probability distribution of  given the modified pedigree  which may still have many loops. Furthermore  marginal posterior genotype probabilities are needed in genetic counseling in humans and selective breeding in domesticated species. An efficient  exact  deterministic algorithm is available to compute the marginal posterior genotype probabilities for every member in a pedigree without loops []. However  it is not straightforward how to extend this algorithm to compute marginal posterior genotype probabilities for pedigrees with loops. Recently  junction tree methods from graph theory were used to describe an efficient algorithm to compute marginal posterior genotype probabilities for pedigrees with loops []. Most geneticists  however  are not familiar with junction tree concepts  and thus such algorithms would not readily be incorporated in genetic analyses  especially because the paper of Lauritzen and Sheehan [] is not self-contained  but relies on results from other sources. In this paper  we present a self-contained description of an efficient  exact  deterministic algorithm to compute marginal posterior genotype probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops  without use of junction tree methods. This algorithm has been implemented in the public domain software package MATVEC and can be obtained from the corresponding author. Following is a brief outline of the presentation. First we define pedigree loops. Next we discuss the relationship between the likelihood and marginal posterior genotype probabilities of pedigree members. Following this  anterior and posterior cutsets are introduced. Anterior cutsets are used to compute the likelihood by the Elston-Stewart algorithm (peeling)  and anterior and posterior cutsets are used to describe an efficient algorithm to calculate marginal probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops. Next  marginal genotype probabilities are calculated for every member in a cattle pedigree that contains loops. Finally  in the appendix  a small example is used to illustrate in detail the theoretical concepts discussed in this article. Here we define pedigree loops indirectly by providing a simple algorithm to determine if a pedigree contains loops. A pedigree is a set of individuals  each of which can be classified as a founder or a non-founder. A founder is a pedigree member whose parents are not in the pedigree  and a non-founder is a pedigree member with both parents present in the pedigree. A nuclear family consists of a set of parents and all their off spring. A terminal family is a family that has at most one member who belongs to at least one other nuclear family. Terminal members of a pedigree are members of terminal families that do not belong to another family. The algorithm used to determine if a pedigree contains loops relies on identifying and then eliminating terminal members from the pedigree. If a pedigree does not contain any loops  repeated removal of terminal members from the pedigree will result in all members being removed from the pedigree. On the other hand  if a pedigree contains any loops  not all members of the pedigree can be removed by repeated removal of terminal members. See additional file : \"Algorithm to detect loops.pdf\" for an example of the use of this algorithm to identify loops in arbitrary pedigrees. Consider a pedigree with  individuals  and let denote the possible genotype and the observed phenotype of an arbitrary pedigree member . Note that both and can be a function of a single locus or of multiple loci on the chromosome. The likelihood for a genetic model given the observed data can be written as where (  ;     ) denotes the joint distribution of all () and all () in the pedigree   is the vector of recombination rates between loci   is the vector of gene frequencies  and  is the vector of parameters in the genetic model that relates and []. Furthermore  the likelihood can be written as where  is a set of possible genotypes of a given set of pedigree members   and  is defined as where (|   ) is the conditional probability of the phenotype given the genotype (also known as the penetrance function of individual )  Pr(| ) is the marginal probability that a founder has genotype (founder probability) and Pr(|     ) is the probability that a non-founder has genotype given that its mother () has genotype  and its father () has genotype  (transition probability). When    and  consist of multiple loci  the multilocus transition probability can be written as a product of single-locus transition probabilities and recombination probabilities between adjacent loci  by making use of the Markov property for recombination events between adjacent loci that holds under the assumption of no interference [  ]. Note that  for each individual  in the pedigree  a set is defined that contains either one or three individuals. For founders  contains only   while for non-founders  contains and . For an arbitrary pedigree member   marginal genotype probabilities can be written as where  is the likelihood defined in 2  and  is the likelihood computed with fixed at genotype . Thus  the efficient computation of marginal genotype probabilities using equation  requires an efficient algorithm to compute the likelihood. The computation of the likelihood using 2 is not efficient for pedigrees having more than about 20 members. However  the Elston-Stewart algorithm  which is also known as peeling  can be used to efficiently compute the likelihood [  ]. Still  using equation  to compute marginal probabilities for  unknown genotypes of individual  requires recomputing the likelihood with =  for each of the  values of . Furthermore  this has to be repeated for all  individuals in the pedigree. In the following section we introduce an algorithm to avoid repeating computations by storing intermediate results in multidimensional tables called anterior and posterior cutsets. Computing the likelihood by peeling involves summing over the genotypes of one individual at a time and storing the intermediate results. For convenience  here we assume that individuals are numbered in the order that they are peeled. Peeling the first individual amounts to computing the sum over  of the product of all factors in 2 that contain   for each combination of the other genotypes that occur together with . Results of these summations are stored in a multidimensional table that has been called a cutset []. Here we will refer to these tables as anterior cutsets. The anterior cutset obtained after peeling  will be denoted by  and is calculated as where  is a set of pedigree members defined as follows. Using the sets defined earlier for each individual in the pedigree   is defined as the union of all that contain individual 1. Then  is obtained by removing individual 1 from . Further   is the set of genotypes for the individuals in . Note that the product in 5 is over those pedigree members  that contain individual 1 in their . Replacing in 2 the product of all factors containing   summed over   with  gives the following expression for the likelihood where  = { ... } is the set of possible genotypes of the individuals that remain to be peeled  and the product is over those pedigree members  that do not contain individual 1 in their . The likelihood expressed as above after peeling   will be referred to as   and in general after peeling   will be referred as . Note that after  has been peeled  the summation in 6 is only over the genotypes of individuals 2 ... . As described below  and later illustrated through a hypothetical example in the Appendix  as each individual is peeled  an anterior cutset is generated. After peeling the last individual  the final anterior cutset will have only a single value that is equal to the likelihood. Note that for a pedigree with  members  there are ! possible peeling orders. Although any choice of a peeling sequence will lead to the same value for the likelihood  not all choices of the peeling sequence lead to anterior cutsets of the same size. As the amount of memory required does depend on the size of the cutsets  a peeling sequence leading to smaller cutsets is more desirable. However  even for moderately large   an exhaustive search for an efficient peeling sequence is not feasible. Furthermore  there is no known algorithm to efficiently find the peeling order with the lowest storage requirements []. However  the following simple heuristic procedure can be used to generate a good peeling sequence. At any stage of the peeling process  in order to decide which individual should be peeled next  for each individual  that remains to be peeled  we compute the size of the anterior cutset that would be generated by peeling . The individual with the smallest anterior cutset size is chosen to be peeled next []. Now it is convenient to introduce the posterior cutset which will be used to avoid repeating computations in calculating genotype probabilities. By factoring out  from 6 and by summing over the genotypes of all remaining pedigree members not contained in   we can define a second multidimensional table called a posterior cutset where  is not a function of . As a result we can rewrite the likelihood as follows In the general description of peeling given below  we make extensive use of two sets defined for each individual . The first set has already been described earlier  and it is completely determined by the pedigree. The second set contains the individuals in the cutset that is generated when  is peeled. Thus  is determined by the pedigree and the peeling order. In general  peeling individual  amounts to computing the sum over of the product of all factors in that contain   for each combination of the other genotypes that occur together with . These summations are stored in the anterior cutset for : where  is an individual whose function () remains in and      is an individual whose anterior cutset  remains in and     = ()  ( )  and = -. Replacing in the sum over of the product of all factors containing with  gives the likelihood expression : where  are the functions from that were not used in the calculation of  and  are the anterior cutsets from that were not used in the calculation of . Now we obtain the posterior cutset for  by removing  from : Note that  is not a function of . Thus  in general we can write the likelihood as follows Now we are ready to explain how to compute genotype probabilities for any individual   using anterior and posterior cutsets. As in equation   marginal genotype probabilities for  can be written as The denominator of 13 is given by 12  while the numerator is obtained by computing 12 with fixed at . If  is in more than one set of pedigree members   identifying the set with smallest number of members will minimize the required computations. However  if  is not in any   we first write the likelihood 12 as a product of the anterior and posterior cutsets for . In this expression  however   has already been peeled. Equation   which is used to compute the anterior cutset for an arbitrary individual  contains that individual prior to it being peeled. Thus  by substituting in 12  the expression given in 9 for  gives Now the numerator of 13 is obtained by computing 14 with fixed at . Provided a good peeling sequence is available  computation of the required anterior cutsets and the summation over  in 12 or  in 14 would be feasible. However  posterior cutsets cannot be computed efficiently using 11 because here the summation may be over a very large set of genotypes. Fortunately  posterior cutsets can be computed recursively as described below. Although the derivation of the recursive algorithm given below is conceptually straightforward  it may be tedious to follow. Thus  at the end of this section  we provide four easy to implement steps to efficiently compute posterior cutsets. The key principle that we have used to compute marginal posterior probabilities efficiently is that any pedigree member can be assigned into one of three mutually exclusive sets with respect to any individual : the set of members that contribute to   the set of members that contribute to   or the set of members in . For example  in computing the numerator of 13 by using 12  the intermediate results from peeling individuals in the first set were stored in  and used repeatedly  the intermediate results from peeling individuals in the second set were stored in  and used repeatedly  and only the calculations for peeling individuals in the third set were repeated. This principle of factoring the likelihood into anterior and posterior components is used repeatedly in the following derivations. To derive the recursive algorithm  first we establish that  = 1.0  which is the base case of the recursion. Similar to 10  after peeling individual  - 1  the likelihood expression becomes Because only individual  remains to be peeled  and contain only . The likelihood now becomes Further  using 9   can be written as Note that in 16 and 17 the right-hand sides are identical  and thus  = . However  from 12 and thus  = 1.0. Now  for any other individual    can be computed recursively as follows. The anterior cutset  generated when  is peeled  is used in the calculation of the anterior cutset generated when  = min() is peeled. The resulting anterior cutset can be written as where  are all remaining functions with     and  are the remaining anterior cutsets with   in addition to . Similar to (12) we can also write and by using (19) in (20) we can write Recall that we have defined the set of individuals =  {}  and thus we can write Note that both (12) and (22) contain the term . By rearranging 22  the likelihood can be written as and using 12 we can write Thus  the posterior cutset for individual  can be expressed as a function of some anterior cutsets and the posterior cutset for individual  > . Starting at individual  - 1 all posterior cutsets can be computed in the reverse order of peeling because  = 1.0. In summary  the following procedure can be used to recursively compute the posterior cutset of an arbitrary individual  in a pedigree: Compute anterior cutsets for all individuals in the pedigree. This step is done only once. Identify the anterior cutset  whose summand contains the factor  (see equation ). Replace  in the summand of  with   and for each value of  sum over the remaining genotypes in this expression (see equation ). If  has not been computed yet  use steps 2  3 and 4 to compute it (this is the recursion). Note that to compute marginal posterior genotype probabilities for an arbitrary member of the pedigree using this algorithm  we need to calculate all anterior cutsets and a subset of all posterior cutsets. Both the anterior and the posterior cutset of a given individual have the same size. The computation of an anterior cutset involves the summation over the genotypes of one individual. The computation of a posterior cutset can involve summations over the genotypes of a variable number individuals. The theoretical concepts introduced in this section are illustrated in detail for a simple example in the Appendix. In the following section we discuss a real data application of the theoretical concepts described above. Consider the pedigree given in the first three columns of Table  with a graphical representation given in Figure . Six terminal members of this cattle pedigree (individuals A21  A22  A23  A24  A25 and A26) are known to be affected by a monogenic recessive disease. Conditional on disease status  assumed mode of inheritance  pedigree information  and on the assumption that the frequency of the recessive allele in the cattle population from which the pedigree was sampled is equal to 0.00001  we calculate genotype probabilities for every member of the pedigree using the algorithm described above. Of the six founders present in this cattle pedigree  founder individual A2 is identified to be a carrier of the recessive allele with probability 1.0. Selective breeding decisions can be made given the calculated posterior genotype probabilities. . Next  we augment the genetic information used to calculate posterior genotype probabilities  by including genetic data on two marker loci flanking the hypothesized position of the recessive locus. Each marker locus has three alleles and the two loci are separated by 0.8 cM with the hypothesized position of the recessive locus 0.5 cM from the left marker (M1). The allele scores of the two markers used are given in Table . The impact of the additional information provided by the marker data is reflected in the posterior probability of individuals A19 and A20 being carriers of the recessive allele (Table ). While without marker data individuals A19 and A20 have a posterior probability of being carriers equal to 0.6667  with marker data the probability is close to one. As stated by Jensen and Kong [] current algorithms for calculating marginal posterior genotype probabilities by peeling are inefficient. As described earlier  computing marginal genotype probabilities for individual  using equation   requires recomputing the likelihood for each of the possible genotypes of individual . For the last individual in the peeling sequence  this can be done efficiently because intermediate results from peeling individuals 1 through  - 1  for each possible value of   have been stored in the anterior cutset . Thus  by making use of the intermediate results stored in   only calculations from the last step of peeling need to be repeated to compute . For any  that is in more than one set we identify the smallest containing . The intermediate results from peeling individuals 1 through  are stored in anterior cutsets  including   and do not have to be recomputed. In this paper we have introduced a second type of cutset  called a posterior cutset  together with an algorithm for its efficient computation. The posterior cutset  contains the intermediate results from peeling all individuals that did not contribute to  and are not contained in the set . Thus  by making use of the intermediate results stored in both  and   only calculations associated with peeling individuals in (except ) need to be repeated to compute the numerator  of 13. For any  that is not in any the expression used to compute genotype probabilities (14) cannot be written as a product of a single anterior and posterior. However  any of the anterior the posterior cutsets used in 14 can be computed efficiently. Thus  this new peeling based algorithm provides an efficient method to compute marginal genotype probabilities for an arbitrary member of a pedigree with loops. The computational cost of obtaining posterior genotype probabilities for all members of a pedigree would approximately be equal to twice that of computing the likelihood because computing the likelihood only requires computing the anterior cutsets while computing all genotype probabilities would require computing the posterior cutsets also. As stated by Jensen and Kong []  a peeling based algorithm would be more accessible to researchers in genetics than the currently available junction-tree methods []. Throughout this paper the likelihood was written as a sum over genotype variables. However  when the genotype of an individual is defined over  loci  the number of genotypes increases exponentially with . In such situations  writing the likelihood as a sum over allele state and origin allele variables may lead to more efficient computations []. Algorithms presented in this paper can be used to calculate the posterior allele state and allele origin probabilities by peeling over allele state and allele origin variables. The pedigree given in Figure  will be used to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed above. . First we show how to use the Elston-Stewart algorithm to compute the likelihood for a genetic model given this pedigree. Next we describe how to calculate marginal posterior genotype probabilities for an arbitrary member of this pedigree using the efficient algorithm described above. As shown in 2  the likelihood given the observed data can be written as In the pedigree given in Figure   individuals are numbered according to a suitable peeling sequence. Note that in 25 (    ) is the only function that involves . Peeling  amounts to computing the sum over  of (    )  for each combination of the genotypes for individuals 5 and 4  and storing the results of these summations in the anterior cutset Note that  is a two dimensional table of size  ×   where  and  are the number of possible genotypes for individuals 5 and 4. Replacing the sum over  of (    ) in 25 with  gives the likelihood expression : Note that in (    ) is the only function that involves . Therefore  the anterior cutset for 2 (obtained by peeling ) is Replacing the sum over  of (    ) in  with  gives the likelihood expression : Note that in (    ) is the only function that involves . Therefore  the anterior cutset for 3 (obtained by peeling ) is Replacing the sum over  of (    ) in  with  gives the likelihood expression : Note that in  not only (    )  but also    and  involve . Thus  peeling  yields the following anterior cutset The resulting anterior cutset  is a three dimensional table of size  ×  ×   where    and  are the number of possible genotypes for individuals 7  6 and 5.  replaces in  the factors (    )     and  summed over . Thus  the likelihood expression  becomes Note that in  both (    ) and  involve . Peeling  yields the following anterior cutset This cutset replaces in  the factors (    ) and  summed over . Thus  the likelihood expression  becomes In  both () and  involve . Peeling  yields the following anterior cutset By replacing () and  summed over  with  in   the likelihood expression  becomes Note  however  that the anterior cutset obtained by peeling  yields the numerical value and thus the likelihood expression : Recall that for an arbitrary member of the pedigree (e.g. individual 3) we can calculate marginal genotype probabilities as follows where  is the likelihood computed with  fixed at . As discussed earlier  using this procedure to compute marginal genotype probabilities for  unknown genotypes of individual 3 requires recomputing the likelihood for the entire pedigree  times. However by writing the likelihood as in 12  these computations can be done efficiently. Consider computing marginal posterior genotype probabilities for individual 3. Recall that  as shown in 26   = S(    ). Using this in 12 we obtain Note that 32 can be used to calculate the denominator of 31  while the numerator of 31 can be obtained by fixing  in 32 at . To complete the calculations  however  we need to compute . This is done using the recursive procedure described previously as shown below. Step 1 of the procedure is to compute anterior cutsets for all individuals in the pedigree  and this has already been done. Following step 2  we determine that  contributes to the computation of  (see equation ). Following step 3   is replaced with  in 27 and  for each value of  and   the sum over  and  is computed to obtain Following step 4  note that  is not computed yet. Thus  steps 2  3 and 4 are repeated as follows. Following step 2  we determine that  contributes to the computation of  (see equation ). Following step 3   is replaced with  in 28 and  for each value of    and   we obtain Following step 4  note that  is not computed yet. Thus  steps 2  3 and 4 are repeated as follows. Following step 2  we determine that  contributes to the computation of  (see equation ). Following step 3   is replaced with  in 29 and  for each value of  and  we obtain Following step 4  note that  is not computed yet. Thus  steps 2  3 and 4 are repeated as follows. Following step 2  we determine that  contributes to the computation of  (see equation ). Following step 3   is replaced with  in 30 and  for each value of  we obtain Following step 4  note that  = 1.0  and thus the calculations for  can be completed. Now using   the calculations for  can be completed  and using   the calculations for  can be completed. Finally  using   the calculations for  can be completed.

Both findings are a problem for breeds where the number of individuals in the reference population is limited. A multi-breed reference population is a potential solution  and here we investigate the accuracies of GEBV in Holstein dairy cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population is single breed or multi-breed. The accuracies were obtained both as a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix and from the realised accuracies of GEBV.MethodsBest linear unbiased prediction with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and two Bayesian methods (BAYESA and BAYES_SSVS) which estimate individual SNP effects were used to predict GEBV for 400 and 77 young Holstein and Jersey bulls respectively  from a reference population of 781 and 287 Holstein and Jersey bulls  respectively.

Both findings are a problem for breeds where the number of individuals in the reference population is limited. A multi-breed reference population is a potential solution  and here we investigate the accuracies of GEBV in Holstein dairy cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population is single breed or multi-breed. The accuracies were obtained both as a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix and from the realised accuracies of GEBV. Best linear unbiased prediction with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and two Bayesian methods (BAYESA and BAYES_SSVS) which estimate individual SNP effects were used to predict GEBV for 400 and 77 young Holstein and Jersey bulls respectively  from a reference population of 781 and 287 Holstein and Jersey bulls  respectively. Genotypes of 39 048 SNP markers were used. Phenotypes in the reference population were de-regressed breeding values for production traits. For the GBLUP method  expected accuracies calculated from the diagonal of the inverse of coefficient matrix were compared to realised accuracies. When GBLUP was used  expected accuracies from a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix agreed reasonably well with realised accuracies calculated from the correlation between GEBV and EBV in single breed populations  but not in multi-breed populations. When the Bayesian methods were used  realised accuracies of GEBV were up to 13% higher when the multi-breed reference population was used than when a pure breed reference was used. However no consistent increase in accuracy across traits was obtained. Predicting genomic breeding values using a genomic relationship matrix is an attractive approach to implement genomic selection as expected accuracies of GEBV can be readily derived. However in multi-breed populations  Bayesian approaches give higher accuracies for some traits. Finally  multi-breed reference populations will be a valuable resource to fine map QTL. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions based on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) []. To calculate GEBV  first a prediction equation based on a large number of DNA markers  such as SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) markers  is derived. The effects of these markers are estimated in a reference population in which animals are both phenotyped and genotyped. In subsequent generations  animals can be genotyped for the markers and the effects of the genotypes summed across the whole genome to predict the GEBV. Recently  the accuracy of GEBV predicted in this way has been evaluated in experiments involving dairy cattle populations in the United States  New Zealand  Australia  and the Netherlands [–]. These experiments used reference populations of between 650 and 4 500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls  genotyped for approximately 50 000 genome-wide markers. Accuracies of GEBV for young bulls whose phenotypes were not used in the reference population were between 0.4 and 0.82 across a range of traits. A key finding from experiments conducted to date is that the reference population must be very large to subsequently predict accurate GEBV. For example in one experiment the gain in coefficient of determination of GEBV for bulls in a validation data set on their daughter deviations for net merit (R) was investigated as the number of bulls in the reference set increased from 1151 bulls to 3576 bulls []. There was a linear increase in R with the number of bulls in the reference set over this range  with every 100 bulls adding 0.008 to R []. Given this result  assembling reference populations large enough to achieve high accuracies of GEBV will present a major challenge for breeds which have limited numbers of genotyped and phenotyped animals. One potential solution would be to use the prediction equation from a breed with a large reference population to predict GEBV in other breeds. However this strategy does not hold much promise: it has been reported that SNP estimates calculated from a Holstein-Friesian reference population did not produce accurate GEBV in Jersey bulls  and vice versa []. Correlations ranged from -0.1 to 0.3 when the SNP effects from one breed were used to calculate GEBV in another breed []. Genomic selection relies on the assumption that phases of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) are the same in selection candidates and the reference population. Thus one explanation for the across-breed results is that the SNP are in LD with the QTL within a breed  but not across breeds. Another experiment analysed the extent of LD within and between several beef and dairy breeds  and concluded that for breeds as divergent as Holstein and Jersey  markers would have to be 10 kb apart or less (much denser than the approximately 65 kb density used in the above experiments) for marker-QTL phase to persist across breeds []. Another complication is that the effect of QTL alleles may not be the same in different breeds and populations  or that the QTL may not be segregating across breeds. A different solution would be to use a multi-breed reference population  perhaps with limited numbers of secondary breeds  so that potentially all the genetic variants segregating within and across breeds are captured. This strategy has been evaluated using simulated data []. It was demonstrated that using a multi-breed reference population with relatively few individuals of the second breed could improve the accuracy of GEBV for that second breed  provided markers were sufficiently dense and the breeds were not too diverged. In this work  we have investigated the accuracy of GEBV for dairy production traits in Holstein dairy cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population consists of Holstein bulls only  Jersey bulls only  or bulls of both breeds  with all bulls genotyped for approximately 50 000 markers. Accuracies were evaluated for two types of methods. The first set of methods estimated individual SNP effects in the reference population  and then predicted GEBV for selection candidates by summing the SNP effects across the marker genotype they carried. The second set of methods predicted breeding values by replacing the average relationship matrix with the genomic relationship matrix in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) equations Another significant challenge in the implementation of genomic selection is to derive an expected accuracy of GEBV  as is current practise for EBV in national genetic evaluations []. In this study we have also investigated the agreement of expected accuracies obtained as a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix when a genomic relationship matrix is used  with accuracies of GEBV obtained by correlating GEBV and breeding values for bulls with a large number of daughters in both single breed and multi-breed populations. One thousand and two hundred Holstein bulls and 400 Jersey bulls were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine50K array  which includes 54 001 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The phenotypes used were de-regressed Australian breeding values (ABV) for protein yield  protein percentage  fat yield  fat percentage and milk yield. The breeding values were de-regressed to remove the contribution from relatives other than daughters []. All bulls had at least 80 daughters. The following criteria and checks were applied to the bull's genotypes. Mendelian consistency checks revealed a small number of either sons discordant with their sires at many (>1000) SNP or sires with many discordant sons. These animals (17) were removed from the data set. In addition  we omitted bulls for which more than 20% of the genotypes were missing. One thousand  one hundred and eighty one Holstein and 364 Jersey bulls passed these criteria. Criteria for selecting SNP were: less than 5% pedigree discordants (e.g. cases where a sire was homozygous for one allele and progeny were homozygous for the other allele)  90% call rate  MAF>2%  Hardy Weinberg P < 0.00001. Forty thousand and seventy seven SNP met all these criteria. All SNP which could not be mapped or were on the X chromosome were excluded from the final data set  leaving 39 048. Parentage checking was then performed again  and any genotype incompatible with the pedigree was set as missing. To impute missing genotypes  the SNP were ordered by chromosome position  and the genotype calls and missing genotype information were submitted to fastPHASE chromosome by chromosome []. The genotypes were taken as those filled in by fastPHASE. The Holstein reference (n = 781) and Jersey reference bulls (n = 287) were those progeny tested before 2004. The Holstein validation bulls were progeny tested during or after 2004 (n = 400)  and the Jersey validation bulls were progeny tested after 2004 as well (n = 77). In a single breed population  if the number of QTL with effects normally distributed with a constant variance is high  then genomic selection is equivalent to replacing the expected relationship matrix with the genomic relationship matrix () estimated from DNA markers in the BLUP equations [–]. We assume a model where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the mean  is a vector of 1s   is a design matrix allocating records to breeding values   is a vector of breeding values and  is a vector of random normal deviates ~ . Then  =  where is the effect of the SNP  and (g) =  . Elements of matrix  are for the animal and SNP  where = 0 - 2if the animal is homozygous 11 at the SNP  1-2if the animal is heterozygous and 2 - 2if the animal is homozygous 22 at the SNP. The diagonal elements of  will be  where  is the number of SNPs. If  is scaled such that  then . This is very similar to a previous definition of  except that it is rescaled so that the average of the diagonal elements is 1 []. Then breeding values for both phenotyped and non-phenotyped individuals can be predicted by solving the equations for model 1 above: where  is the realised relationship matrix calculated as above  and  is a genetic variance. Variance components were estimated with ASREML []. The realised accuracy of GEBV was calculated as r(GEBV  ABV) where r(GEBV  ABV) was calculated in each validation population (Holstein and Jersey) separately  and ABV is the current Australian breeding value for bulls in the validation population. The expected accuracy of GEBV for the individual was calculated from the standard error of the breeding value as . We also compared r(GEBV  ABV) from GBLUP to approaches that estimate individual SNP effects and then calculate GEBV as the sum of these effects. The alternatives considered were BayesA and a Bayesian approach using stochastic search variable selection  BAYES_SSVS [  ]. BayesA makes a prior assumption that SNP effects are t-distributed  while BAYES_SSVS makes a prior assumption that a proportion  of the SNP effects are t-distributed and 1-  of the SNP effects have very close to zero []. Briefly  the model fitted in both BayesA and BAYES_SSVS was: where  is a vector of  daughter yield deviations corrected for herd year season effects for each trait   is ( × ) a design matrix allocating records to the marker effects with element = 0  1 or 2 if the genotype of animal  at SNP  is 11  12 or 22 respectively. Vector  is a ( × 1) vector of SNP effects assumed normally distributed ~ (0  )   is a vector of random deviates where  is the error variance  is the polygenic breeding value of the animal  with variance   where  is the average relationship matrix. In BayesA and BAYES_SSVS the prior for  was an inverse chi square distribution with 4.012 and 4.34 degrees of freedom  respectively. In BAYES_SSVS  was 0.05. Using the predicted SNP effects from each method  we predicted GEBV in the validation sets as . The genomic relationship matrix revealed a high level of relationship within the Holstein breed and within the Jersey breed  but very limited relationship between the breeds (Figure ). Jersey individuals had a greater level of relationship within the breed than Holstein individuals  which is consistent with the higher inbreeding level for this breed []. The higher level of relationship could also reflect the fact that there were the number of animals in the Jersey reference population was smaller than that in the Holstein reference population  so the average allele frequency estimates used to modify  are closer to the Holstein allele frequencies. . Note that the genomic relationships have been re-scaled such that all elements are positive. When GBLUP was applied only within a breed (Holstein reference only used to predict Holstein validation GEBV and likewise for Jersey)  realised and expected accuracies were in reasonable agreement (Table ) although the expected accuracies did over-predict the realised accuracies in Holsteins  by 8% overage across the traits. Results agreed better with the Jersey breed. GEBV accuracies can be compared to the accuracy of information available when the animals were born if the markers were not used. This is a breeding value computed from the individuals sire  maternal grandsire  and maternal grand sire breeding values from 2003  before the bulls in the validation data sets had any daughter information (this \"sire pathway\" breeding value is often used for selection because dam information may be missing or biased). GEBV accuracies were considerably higher than the accuracies of \"sire pathway\" breeding values for most traits. It is important to note that the realised accuracy was calculated as r(GEBV  ABV) in the validation data set  which does not take into account the fact that the ABV have less than perfect correlation with true breeding values. The r(ABV  TBV) for the traits here was estimated as 0.92 by ADHIS. If the realised accuracies reported here are adjusted by this amount  the realised and expected accuracies for Holsteins are in better agreement. However  this adjustment may also bias the realised accuracies upwards  for example if the GEBV predicts the average relationship component of ABV more accurately than the component derived from individual SNP effects (eg Mendelian sampling). It has been demonstrated that breeding values predicted with GBLUP contain a considerable genetic relationship component []. When GBLUP was used to estimate GEBV using the combined (Holstein and Jersey) reference population  the realised accuracies of Jersey and Holstein GEBV were slightly higher for some traits than those obtained from the purebred reference populations (Table ). However  agreement between realised and expected accuracies was weak with the expected accuracy over predicting considerably the realised accuracy. Our GBLUP results agreed with previous results in that when the Holstein SNP effects equations were used to predict Jersey GEBV  GEBV accuracies were close to zero  and likewise when SNP effects derived only from the Jersey reference population were used to predict Holstein GEBV (Table ) []. The exception to this was fat percentage  where low to moderately accurate GEBV could be predicted for Jersey individuals from a Holstein reference and vice versa. This is likely because a QTL having a strong effect on fat percentage segregates in both breeds and the effect of the alleles on fat percentage follows the same direction in both breeds  and by coincidence the effects of the SNP associated with this polymorphism follow the same direction in both breeds []. With a Holstein only reference  Jersey GEBV from BayesA or Bayes_SSVS were more accurate than GBLUP GEBV. However  with a Jersey reference both the Bayesian methods and GBLUP gave similar (zero) accuracy of Holstein GEBV. The difference between these two results may reflect the small size of the Jersey reference population. Using a combined Holstein Jersey reference population increased the accuracy of GEBV for both Holstein and Jersey individuals by up to 13% (for fat percentage) over that achieved with respective purebred reference populations when BayesA or BAYES_SSVS were used to predict SNP effects. When the combined reference population was used  GEBV accuracies for the Jersey validation set were higher from BayesA and BAYES_SSVS than from GBLUP for all traits except protein kg. GEBV accuracies of Holstein individuals were either the same or slightly lower compared with a pure Holstein reference population. There was very little difference in accuracy of GEBV from BayesA and BAYES_SSVS. Predicting breeding values by replacing the expected additive relationship matrix with the genomic relationship in the usual BLUP equations is an attractive approach to implement genomic selection for two reasons. GEBV accuracies predicted in this way are the same as those from BLUP methods  which predict individual SNP effects since the models are equivalent [      ]. Furthermore  in the GBLUP approach  expected accuracies of breeding values are readily calculated from the diagonal elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. In populations of Holstein and Jersey bulls genotyped for approximately 50 000 markers  we have demonstrated that expected accuracies calculated in this way agree well with realised accuracies calculated from the correlation between GEBV and EBV in purebred populations. However when a multi-breed reference population was used the expected accuracy considerably over predicted the realised accuracy. Estimating  using a  derived from a multi-breed population is likely to result in an artificially high genetic variance. This is because the resulting estimate of  will be for a \"base population\" from which the breeds subsequently diverged. We did observe that estimates of  were higher when the multi-breed reference population was used than when either purebred reference populations were used. The estimate of  used to calculate the expected accuracies could be corrected for the inbreeding within in each breed subsequent to the base population. For Holstein individuals this value (calculated as twice the average off diagonal element in the genomic relationship matrix  for Holstein-Holstein elements) was 0.012 while for Jersey individuals it was 0.18. We recalculated the expected accuracies within each breed using   where was 0.012 and 0.18 for Jerseys and Holsteins  respectively. This did reduce the expected accuracies  particularly for Jerseys but not to values comparable to the realised accuracies (Table ). Another possibility is that the between-breed relationships are over-estimated due to inadequate marker density  resulting in inflation of the accuracy. This will be a topic for future research. Our results demonstrate that using a reference population of one breed to predict GEBV of another breed gave low GEBV accuracies or equal to zero. However  combining reference individuals across a breed to form the reference populations resulted in accuracies of GEBV in purebred validation sets comparable or exceeding that achieved with a purebred reference population of the same breed. With BayesA and BAYES_SSVS  the accuracy of GEBV for most traits in the Jersey validation populations was greater when a multi-breed reference population was used than when a purebred Jersey population was used  by up to 13%. This suggests that for breeds with a small reference population  combining with other breeds to form a multi-breed reference is a possibility. Crossbred animals may also be useful candidates for the reference population. Indeed  a recent experiment demonstrated using a simulated population that a crossbreed reference population gave GEBV accuracies in selection candidates from contributing pure breed populations almost as high as from purebred reference populations of the same size []. Another study observed that using a combined Jersey Holstein reference population gave good GEBV accuracies in Holstein-Jersey cross bulls []. One hypothesis to explain the reasonable accuracy of GEBV in purebred candidates when a multi-breed reference population is used with BayesA or BAYES_SSVS to calculate SNP effects could be as follows. In order for an SNP to have an effect in a multi-breed reference population  it must be in LD with a QTL in both breeds  and given the extent of LD across breeds for this to occur the SNP must be very close to the QTL [  ]. Hence SNP that are in partial LD with a QTL in one breed are filtered  and only SNP in high LD with the QTL receive an effect in the prediction equation. This means that the SNP effect is more likely to persist across populations and generations  with as a result higher GEBV accuracies. Support for this hypothesis is given in Figure . DGAT1 is a gene on bovine chromosome 14 that harbours a mutation with a major effect on fat percentage in milk in Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle [  ]. In the Holstein population analysed in our work  the effect of this mutation is captured by two SNP  one very close to the gene  and one ~200 kb away. The SNP 200 kb from DGAT1 is in lower LD  but still has an effect. However  the SNP very close to DGAT1 is a better marker  with an effect likely to persist across populations and generations  because it is in such high LD with the mutation. Using a multi-breed reference population filters the SNP 200 kb from DGAT1  such that only the marker very close to the gene still has an effect. The above hypothesis is also supported in part by the results of Zhong et al. []. These authors have used simulated data to investigate factors affecting accuracy of genomic selection in populations derived from multiple inbred lines. In their simulations of a \"multi-line\" population  a method similar to BAYES_SSVS gave more accurate GEBV than other methods when the markers were in high LD with QTL of large effect  or when GEBV were predicted for selection candidates several generations removed from the reference population. Both these results suggest that in their \"multi-line\" population  their Bayesian method was able to identify SNPs in high LD with the QTL and use these in predicting GEBV. . Although BayesA and BAYES_SSVS resulted in GEBV with slightly higher realised accuracies than GBLUP when a multi-breed reference population was used  a drawback of these methods is that there is no obvious way to calculate expected accuracy of the breeding values obtained from these methods for selection candidates with no phenotype. In practise  the accuracy of GEBV from GBLUP may be close enough to those of BayesA and BAYES_SSVS  so that the Bayesian methods could be used to calculate SNP effects for predicting GEBV to maximise their accuracy  while expected and slightly conservative accuracies are calculated with GBLUP. Our GEBV accuracies for the Jersey breed  even with a purebred Jersey reference population  were surprisingly high given the small size of the reference population. One explanation could be the low N of this breed and the high relationships in Figure  in the Jersey population) []. The N is one of the key parameters affecting the accuracy of genomic selection []. The lower the N  the smaller the number of independent chromosome segments for which effects must be estimated  which in turn leads to a higher GEBV accuracy. In fact the deterministic formula for GEBV accuracy predicts quite well the GEBV accuracies we achieve in the Jersey population given the N  number of records used and heritability [  ]. However the reader is reminded again of the small size of our validation set in the Jersey population. A number of authors have demonstrated that combining pedigree EBV from large national data sets and marker derived breeding values gave more accurate GEBV than just using the marker derived information alone [–]. To calculate GEBV accuracies combining both pedigree and marker information  an index could be constructed reflecting the accuracies of both sources of information. Predicting genomic breeding values using a genomic relationship matrix is an attractive approach to implement genomic selection  since accuracies of genomic breeding values can be calculated from the diagonal elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Our results demonstrate that expected accuracies calculated in this way agree reasonably well with realised accuracies in purebred populations  but not in multi-breed populations. This indicates that the  matrix for multi-breed populations should be scaled in some way to achieve appropriate expected accuracies. Bayesian approaches that estimate individual SNP effects gave higher accuracies for some traits  particularly where there is a known mutation with a large effect on the trait segregating in the population. Finally  multi-breed reference populations could be a valuable resource for mapping QTL. Meuwissen THE  Hayes BJ  Goddard ME: Prediction of total genetic value using genome-wide dense marker maps.

Computing the probabilities of these transmission events is essential to perform QTL detection methods. A fast algorithm for the estimation of these probabilities conditional to parental phases has been developed. It is adapted to classical QTL detection designs applied to outbred populations  in particular to designs composed of half and/or full sib families. It assumes the absence of interference. The theory is fully developed and an example is given. Experimental designs used for mapping QTL in livestock based on linkage analysis techniques generally comprise two or three generations. The younger generation consists of large offsprings (either half sib only or mixture of half and full sib) measured on quantitative traits to be dissected. This generation and in most cases their parents are genotyped for a set of molecular markers. Genotyping an older generation (the grand parents) helps the determination of parents' phases  an information essential to linkage analysis. QTL detection is a multiple step procedure. First the parental phases must be determined from grand parental and/or progeny genotype information  either looking for their most probable phase  or building all possible phases and computing their probabilities. Then transmission probabilities of chromosomal segments from the parents to the progeny must be estimated conditional to the phases. Finally a test statistic (. F or likelihood ratio test)  based on a given model (. regression  mixture model  variance component model...) is performed at each putative QTL position on the chromosomal segments traced. In crosses between inbred lines  the transmission probabilities are simply obtained  as described by []  from the information given by markers flanking the QTL. In outbred populations  the computation is not straightforward  due to the variability of marker informativity between families and within families between progenies. In [  ]  the transmission probabilities were estimated conditionally to the sole flanking markers. [–] used a direct algorithm where all types of gametes corresponding to a linkage group are successively considered: if  markers are heterozygous in the parent  2gametes may be produced. This procedure is simple and computationnally fast for a small number of linked markers  but not feasible as soon as their number exceeds about 15. The difficulty can be circumvented in Bayesian approaches using MCMC techniques where these probabilities need not to be explicitly computed (. []). Nettelblad and colleagues [] recently proposed a simple algorithm  which makes the transmission probabilities easily computable even for a large number of markers. In their approach the full length of the linkage group is still considered. A new algorithm  similar to the principle of [] but exploring the minimum number of useful markers  was implemented in QTLMap software developed by INRA ([]). Here  we describe and illustrate this algorithm. Progeny  was born from sire  and dam . All were genotyped at  loci (   = 1  ). The location of on the linkage group  . its distance from one end of this group  is () centiMorgan  also denoted . The hypothesis of absence of interference is made  allowing the Haldane distance function to be used. The recombination rate between locus  and  will be noted   . Using the Haldane distance  . When distances vary with sex  the superscript  (for males) or  (for females) will be used for and   . Let the marker information be  for the sire   for the dam  allele  for the progeny. In    =    or   the subscript  ( = 1  or 2) denotes the allele read in the records file. The probabilities of transmission of a chromosomal segment from the parents to the progeny are estimated conditional to parental phases. A phase of parent  ( or ) is characterised by a particular order of its marker phanotypes = {}  for loci  = 1 to   giving = {} where  = 1 means the grand sire allele and  = 2 the grand dam allele. If grand parental origins cannot be built  one of the alleles of the first heterozygous marker in the parent to be phased is arbitrary assigned the subscript  = 1. Let () be the transmission event for marker   and () the vector of transmission events on the linkage group: () = {()  ()  ()}. () and  () are respectively the transmission events from the sire and from the dam to the progeny. () =  if the progeny received    =  or . If the grand parental origins are known  progeny  may have received alleles from both its grand sires (() = 1 and () = 1  thus () = 11)  from its paternal grand sire and maternal grand dam (() = 12)  from its paternal grand dam and maternal grand sire (() = 21)  or from both its grand dams (() = 22). The probabilities of the transmission events  given the marker phenotypes and parental phases are listed in Table  for a biallelic marker. The 16 situations described in Table  belong to five types: Type ' : Transmission fully known for both parents (cases 1 to 4)  Type ' 0': Transmission known for the sire only (cases 5 to 8)  Type ' 0': Transmission known for the dam only (cases 9 to 12)  Type ' 00': Unknown Transmission (cases 13 and 14)  Type '': Ambiguous Transmission (case 15 and 16). The  type corresponds to fully heterozygous trios. It is essential to note that this is the only type of marker phenotypes for which the sire and dam transmissions are not independent (e.g. in situation 15  if sire transmits 1  dam transmits 2 and the reverse). When the information about one or both parents is missing the conditionnal probability of () most often corresponds to the  00 type [1/4  1/4  1/4  1/4]. However  when only one parent possesses a marker phanotype and is phased heterozygous (  )  the probabilities are [1/2  0  1/2  0] if = (  ) and [0  1/2  0  1/2] if = (  ). Two properties of the transmission probabilities must be underlined: : Marginally to the marker phenotype  the sire and dam transmission events are independent: [()] = [()].[()]. : Due to the no interference hypothesis  the transmission events follow a Markovian process described by: Note that property 2 is also valid when considering subsets of   and   allowing an independent estimation of probabilities before and after a given marker . If  = {    }  At any position  for a QTL  four grand parental origins are possible for the chromosomal segment inherited by the progeny. Let  = (  )  ( = (11)  (12)  (21) or (22))  the origin of . The objective is to estimate () = [ () =  |     ]  the probability of  given the marker information. To minimize the computation  two procedures are presented: the first one is an iterative exploration of the linkage group  the second a reduction of this group within bounds specific of the tested position . The observed marker phenotypes and parents' phases can be consistent with different transmission events (). All these events must be considered in turn when evaluating the QTL transmission (). For a given marker transmission event  markers must be successively considered  the no interference hypothesis allowing an iterative estimation of the probability.  : Let O be the domain  for the progeny   of transmissions () consistent with the observations   and . The transmission probability () is given by: This is obtained after very simple algebra (see appendix). The domain O is obtained listing possible transmissions. If Ois the consistent domain for marker   the O domain is formed of nested domains O O   O·Ois directly obtained from Table : it is formed of transmission events the probability of which are not nul. For instance  if =   =  and =   then O= {11  12}. In the following we shall note  = <U+2211>[()] and  = <U+2211>[() =   ()].  : The summation  = <U+2211>[()] in (1) can be obtained recursively with the following algorithm: This is obtained under the hypothesis of absence of interference (see appendix). : the numerator of (1) is obtained similarly  considering the extended domain O* = O O O O  with O= . : The [() | ()] are simply obtained as given in Table   for  =  - 1. They may be summarized by a single formulae. Let      = 1 -  - (1 - 2).( - )  : System (2) may be generalized to any subdivision of the linkage group    = {     }  defining ()   = 1    as the vector of ()    . The set of markers  = {   = 1  } may be sequenced as  = {        } where is a subset of interest  and its flanking markers  and and all the remaining markers before and after the area (    ). We now propose three simplifications of the summation  = <U+2211>[()].  : In the summation   the type  00 markers can be ignored  . they may be bypassed in the iterative system (2). Here is a single  00 type marker. Proposition 3 means (see appendix for a demonstration) that  in (2)  the sequence: which corresponds to two iterations  may be replaced by: : In the summation   the elements corresponding to the unknown parental transmission for types  0 or  0 markers can be ignored  . they may be bypassed in the iterative system (2). Here is a single  0 or  0 type marker. Proposition 4 means (see appendix for a demonstration) that  in (2)  the sequence which corresponds to two iterations  may be replaced by (successively  0 and  0 markers): : In the summation   a sequence of markers all belonging to \"\" types (. non ) appears as a single element where only the certain transmissions are involved. From propositions 3 and 4  where the markers subscripted (= 1  ) are successive markers belonging to  or  0 types  and the markers subscripted (= 1  ) to  or  0 types in the sequence .  : A series of markers  = {    } starting with a  0 ( 0) type marker {}  ending with a  0 ( 0) type marker {}  and only with  00 type markers between those bounds (in ) will be called a sd-node (. ds-node). : If the sequence  = {    } of  is a sd-node  the summation  may be separated in three terms corresponding to [/  ]  [  ]  and [/  ] Proposition 5 means (see appendix for a demonstration) that  in (2)   is obtained by : The {    } sequence may be reduced to a single marker if it belongs to the  type. In this case  In general we shall note () the transmission event for a node  {()   ()}  {()  ()} or (). : If the tested QTL position  is located in segment between two nodes  and   only the markers belonging to the interval [  ] have to be considered when computing the transmission probability [() =  |     ]  see appendix  giving: Based on the propositions and corollaries developed above  an algorithm for the computation of transmission probabilities of the chromosomic segment  can be given. From the position   the markers are explored towards the left until a node (a  type marker or a pair of markers one of  0 and the other of  0 type  separated only by  00 type markers) or the extremity of the linkage group is found. Let ( ) be the transmission events for the left node  . [( )] = 1/4. From the position   the markers are explored towards the right until a node or the extremity of the linkage group is found. Let ( ) be the transmission events for the right node  .  [ ( )] = 1/4. The only necessary informative segment for  in the full linkage group is {    }. Let  the  type markers in {    }. Together with  and    the  delimit  + 1 intervals    which may be empty or include  00   0 or  0 type markers. The reduced summation   see (the part of   which differs from   and has to be used in  see appendix) is computed iteratively:  It must be underlined that there is no node between two adjacent  type markers of the informative segment {  }  since this segment ends at the first node found on both sides. As a consequence  neither a  marker type nor a mixture of  0 and  0 types markers could be found between the ambiguous markers () and (): the interval may be classified as  00 (only  00 types markers)   0 (one or more  0 type markers  no  0 type marker and any number of  00 type markers) or  0 (the reverse). Let  and  be two successive  markers  in the iterative process (4)  the probabilities  [()/()] are given by  where      = 1 -  - (1 - 2).( - ). The reduced summation  is computed iteratively adding the ( ) transmission in the list of transmission {[ ]  []    []  [ ]}. The transmission probability [( ) =  |        ] = .  : The algorithm can be organised scanning the interval {  } from the left to the right rather than from the right to the left as described above. A linkage group of eight markers is available (Figure ). Markers  and  are ambiguous  with types 15 and 16. Markers 1 and 8 are fully informative (types 1 and 2)  the other markers are semi informative. The tested position for the QTL  is located between markers 4 and 5. The nodes are  on the left  marker 1 ( type) and on the right  the group  - . Thus the informative segment here is the full group. Steps of the proposed algorithm are detailed Table . . The figure represents a chromosome with eight markers. Two ( and ) are ambiguous (For   the progeny received either the 1allele of its sire and 2allele of its dam  or the 2of its sire and 1of its dam. The nodes are  on the left  the first marker  and on the right  markers  and . The dark (respectively white) circles represent markers with a known (respectively unknown) grand parental origin. The algorithm presented in this paper to estimate the transmission probability of QTL from parents to progeny needs only very limited computational resources  both in terms of time and space. Complementary to the algorithm presented by Nettleblad and colleagues (2009)  it limits the exploration of the linkage group to the markers really informative for a given position to be traced  and thus performs faster. As []  it deals with sex differences between recombination rates. The QTL transmission probability is estimated conditionnaly to the observed transmission at the surrounding markers loci. The algorithm does not make use of possible information about the marker allele frequencies to fill potential information gaps. The major difficulty addressed in this algorithm is the non independence of transmission events from the sire and the dam to the progeny in triple heterozygous trios. In the absence of such trios  the transmission from the parents are fully independent and may be treated separately simply by considering the flanking informative markers. This is the case for QTL located on the sex chromosome X or W. The algorithm has been developed in the framework of QTL detection designs involving two or three generations in outbred populations. It has been implemented in QTLMap  a software for the analysis of such designs. QTLMap is available upon request to the authors. In more complex pedigrees  the transmission probability should not be conditioned only on parents phases and progeny marker phanotypes. Information from the grand progeny (and the spouses lineages) may improve the estimation  since the progeny phase can be inferred  at least partially  from these data. A recursive process inspirated from [] should possibly be implemented. The transmission probabilities are estimated conditionally to parental phases. In linear approaches (. the Haley Knott regression)  if more than one phase is probable  the marginal transmission probability could be estimated considering all of them in a weighted sum of conditional probabilities. Alternatively  the only most probable phase could be considered []. The absence of interference hypothesis is central in the present algebra. If this is not true  then most of the propositions are not valid and the algorithm not applicable. Finally  compared to the most common codominant markers  dominant markers will be characterized by a lower informativity  with an increase of the between nodes segment length and a concomitant decrease of the transmission probability.  [() =  |     ] =  And  similarly  [() =   |   ] = [() =   ()] if ()  O  = 0 if not                                  Due to the no interference hypothesis  the transmission events follow a Markovian process described by: Thus The summations may be inverted: Consequently:                                  With an argument similar to the demonstration of proposition 2  the sum  may be expressed as: Thus As Oforms a complete set of events  since all transmissions are possible  Thus                                  In the equation(A1)  we have  from property 1  Without loss of generality  we assume that the parent with unknown transmission at is the sire. There is a unique consistent ()  and the 2 possible () form a complete set of events  thus: The simplification of [()] follows:                                  When contains markers of  00 type  they can be forgotten following proposition 3. We thus assume that the group is empty  and the linkage group is described as  = {      } But [()  () | ()  ()  ()] = [()  () | ()   ()] Thus                                  Let  = {          with () =  = () From proposition 5  assuming both nodes and are sd-nodes  From proposition 5 again  The elements  and  being also present in the numerator  of (1) they can be forgotten.

Recently  several methods have been proposed to infer population structure in population genetics.MethodsIn this study  a new method to infer the number of clusters and to assign individuals to the inferred populations is proposed. This approach does not make any assumption on Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. The implemented criterion is the maximisation (via a  algorithm) of the averaged genetic distance between a predefined number of clusters. The performance of this method is compared with two Bayesian approaches: STRUCTURE and BAPS  using simulated data and also a real human data set.ResultsThe simulations show that with a reduced number of markers  BAPS overestimates the number of clusters and presents a reduced proportion of correct groupings. The accuracy of the new method is approximately the same as for STRUCTURE. Also  in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium cases  BAPS performs incorrectly. In these situations  STRUCTURE and the new method show an equivalent behaviour with respect to the number of inferred clusters  although the proportion of correct groupings is slightly better with the new method. Re-establishing equilibrium with the randomisation procedures improves the precision of the Bayesian approaches. All methods have a good precision for = 0.03  but only STRUCTURE estimates the correct number of clusters for as low as 0.01. In situations with a high number of clusters or a more complex population structure  MGD performs better than STRUCTURE and BAPS.

Recently  several methods have been proposed to infer population structure in population genetics. In this study  a new method to infer the number of clusters and to assign individuals to the inferred populations is proposed. This approach does not make any assumption on Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. The implemented criterion is the maximisation (via a  algorithm) of the averaged genetic distance between a predefined number of clusters. The performance of this method is compared with two Bayesian approaches: STRUCTURE and BAPS  using simulated data and also a real human data set. The simulations show that with a reduced number of markers  BAPS overestimates the number of clusters and presents a reduced proportion of correct groupings. The accuracy of the new method is approximately the same as for STRUCTURE. Also  in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium cases  BAPS performs incorrectly. In these situations  STRUCTURE and the new method show an equivalent behaviour with respect to the number of inferred clusters  although the proportion of correct groupings is slightly better with the new method. Re-establishing equilibrium with the randomisation procedures improves the precision of the Bayesian approaches. All methods have a good precision for = 0.03  but only STRUCTURE estimates the correct number of clusters for as low as 0.01. In situations with a high number of clusters or a more complex population structure  MGD performs better than STRUCTURE and BAPS. The results for a human data set analysed with the new method are congruent with the geographical regions previously found. This new method used to infer the hidden structure in a population  based on the maximisation of the genetic distance and not taking into consideration any assumption about Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium  performs well under different simulated scenarios and with real data. Therefore  it could be a useful tool to determine genetically homogeneous groups  especially in those situations where the number of clusters is high  with complex population structure and where Hardy-Weinberg and/or linkage equilibrium are present. Traditional population genetic analyses deal with the distribution of allele frequencies between and within populations. From these frequencies several measures of population structure can be estimated  the most widely used being the Wright  statistics []. To calculate these estimators of population structure an  definition of the population is needed. Population determination is usually based on phenotypes or the geographical origin of samples. However  the genetic structure of a population is not always reflected in the geographical proximity of individuals. Nevertheless  populations that are not discretely distributed can be genetically structured  due to unidentified barriers to gene flow. In addition  in groups of individuals with different geographical locations  behavioural patterns or phenotypes are not necessarily genetically differentiated []. As a consequence  an inappropriate  grouping of individuals into populations may diminish the power of the analyses to elucidate biological processes  potentially leading to unsuitable conservation or management strategies. Bayesian clustering algorithms [–] have recently emerged as a prominent computational tool to infer population structure in population genetics and in molecular ecology []. These methods use genetic information to ascertain population membership of individuals without assuming predefined populations. They can assign either the individuals or a fraction of their genome to a number of clusters () based on multilocus genotypes. The methods operate by minimising Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium (but the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within clusters could be avoided  see []). The procedures generally involve Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. These particular clustering methods are useful when genetic data for potential source populations are not available (in opposition to assignment methods)  and they offer a powerful tool to answer questions of ecological  evolutionary  or conservation relevance []. A recent study by Latch . [] compared the relative performance of three non-spatial Bayesian clustering programs  STRUCTURE []  PARTITION [] and BAPS []. A significant difference between STRUCTURE and PARTITION programs is that the former allows the presence of admixed individuals while the latter assumes that all individuals are of pure ancestry. Two main features distinguish BAPS from STRUCTURE. First  in BAPS the number of populations is treated as an unknown parameter that could be estimated from the data set. Second  in the BAPS version 2 a stochastic optimisation algorithm is implemented to infer the posterior mode of  instead of the MCMC algorithm also used in STRUCTURE. Notwithstanding  the most widely used genotypic clustering method is that implemented in the program STRUCTURE. Other clustering methods implement a maximum likelihood method using an expectation-maximisation algorithm  to infer population stratification and individual admixture [  ]. Current developments of Bayesian clustering methods explicitly address the spatial nature of the problem of locating genetic discontinuities by including the geographical coordinates of individuals in their prior distributions [–]. Another way to proceed  as a complement to the previous approaches  is to look directly for the zones of sharp change in genetic data. Two approaches seem better adapted to analyse genetic data: the Wombling method [] and the Monmonier algorithm [–]. Another approach  proposed by Dupanloup  []  is a spatial procedure (spatial analysis of molecular variance; SAMOVA) that does not make any assumption on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium (LE). SAMOVA uses a  algorithm to find the configuration that maximises the proportion of total genetic variance due to differences between groups of populations (a higher hierarchical level when comparing to the alternative group of individuals). In the starting steps of the SAMOVA method  a set of Voronoi polygons are constructed from the geographical coordinates of the sampled points. Thus  this procedure can be useful to identify the location of barriers to gene flow between groups. In the present study  a simple and general method to infer the population structure by assigning individuals to the inferred subpopulations is proposed. The new approach  that implements a  algorithm  is based on the maximisation of the averaged genetic distance between populations and does not make any assumption on HWE within populations and LE between loci. The performance of this method is compared with two Bayesian clustering methods. Simulated data were used to mimic different scenarios including SNP or microsatellite data. In addition  the performance of the proposed method was tested in a previously analysed human data set. The programs used were STRUCTURE version 2.1 [  ] and BAPS version 4.14 [    ]. The software PARTITION [] was not applied in this study because Latch . [] have shown that its performance is less good ( this method identifies correctly only the number of subpopulations at levels = 0.09  while  STRUCTURE and BAPS determine the population substructure extremely well at = 0.02 - 0.03). The parameters for the implementation of STRUCTURE comprise a burn-in of 10000 replicates following 50000 replicates of MCMC. Specifically  the admixture model and the option of correlated allele frequencies between populations were selected  since this configuration is considered the best by Falush  [] in cases of subtle population structures. Similarly  the degree of admixture (alpha) was inferred from the data. When alpha is close to zero  most individuals are essentially from one population or another  while alpha > 1 means that most individuals are admixed. Lambda  the parameter of the Dirichlet distribution of allelic frequencies  was set to one  as advised by the STRUCTURE manual. For each data set  five runs were carried out for each possible number of clusters () in order to quantify the variation in the likelihood of the data for a given . The range of tested  was set according to the true number of simulated populations (see below the simulated data section). Each data set took between 5 to 30 hours to run depending on the number of markers and individuals simulated in the data set (all times provided correspond to a computer with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM). The criterion implemented in STRUCTURE to determine  is the likelihood of the data for a given   (). The number of subpopulations is identified using the maximal value of this likelihood returned by STRUCTURE. However  it has been observed that once the real  is reached the likelihood at larger  levels off or continues increasing slightly  and the variance between runs increases []. Consequently  in our work  the distribution of () did not show a clear mode for the true . Notwithstanding  an  quantity based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function with respect to  (<U+0394>) did show a clear peak at the true value of . Evanno  [] have suggested to estimate <U+0394> as where  is the arithmetic mean across replicates and  is the standard deviation of the replicated (). The value of  selected will correspond to the modal value of the distribution of <U+0394>. The grouping analysis was performed on the results from the run with the maximal value of the likelihood of the data for the estimated . BAPS software was run setting the maximum number of clusters to 20 or 30 depending on the scenario. To make the results fully comparable with those from STRUCTURE  the clustering of the individual option was applied for every scenario. Each data set required approximately 1 to 5 minutes to complete. The rationale behind the new approach (MGD thereafter) is that highly differentiated populations are expected to show a high genetic distance between them. This distance can be calculated from the molecular marker information without assumptions on HWE or LE. From all the genetic distances previously published in the literature []  one of the most used is the Nei minimum distance []. One of the advantages of this genetic distance is that it can be calculated through the pairwise coancestry between individuals []. Following Nei  the distance between clusters  and  can be calculated as where with  the number of loci   the number of alleles in each locus and the frequency of allele  in the locus  for group . The average distance over the entire metapopulation is where the summation is for all couples of  subpopulations  is the number of individuals of population   and . An alternative way of calculating the genetic distance is through the pairwise coancestry between individuals []. In this approach  the Nei minimum distance between two subpopulations can be expressed as where is the average molecular coancestry between individuals of subpopulation  and is the average pairwise molecular coancestry between all possible couples of individuals  one from subpopulation  and the other from subpopulation . The molecular coancestry () can be computed applying Malécot's [] definition of genealogical coancestry to the molecular marker loci (microsatellites or SNP). Thus  the molecular coancestry at a particular locus between two individuals is calculated as the probability that two alleles taken at random  one from each individual  are equal (identical by state  ). Throughout several markers  the molecular coancestry is obtained as the arithmetic mean over marker loci. The advantage of this approach is that the molecular coancestry matrix has to be calculated only once (at the beginning of the optimisation) and then the value for different configurations can be calculated just by averaging different groups of couples. This makes the process quite efficient in terms of computation speed. Notwithstanding  a shortcoming of the method is that no measure of confidence is obtained for the final arrangement of clusters. This problem can be circumvented when using the allele frequency approach by implementing the following strategy. The considered configurations  instead of assigning each individual to a single cluster  are lists of vectors (one for each individual) carrying their probability to belong to each cluster. Consequently  the sum of positions ( probabilities) for a particular individual equals one. In the final (optimal) configuration those individuals with a probability close to one of belonging to a particular cluster can be assigned with great confidence. Contrarily  assignment of individuals with lower probabilities will not be clear  possibly reflecting the presence of admixture or the insufficient amount of information to assign this individual to a single cluster. To determine the frequency of each allele within a cluster  in order to calculate the genetic distances  the number of copies of that allele carried by each individual has to be multiplied by the probability of the individual belonging to the cluster and summed up across all the individuals in the same cluster. After this has been done with all the alleles in a locus  frequencies must be standardised to guaranty that the sum of allelic frequencies equals one. The disadvantage of this strategy is that it is computationally very demanding  since frequencies have to be recalculated for all the loci and alleles for each new considered configuration. Therefore  calculations take much more time depending on how large is the number of loci and their degree of polymorphism. The implementation of both MGD approaches used a  algorithm to find the partition that showed the maximal average genetic distance between populations.  is an optimisation technique initially proposed by Metropolis  []. The connection between this algorithm and mathematical optimisation procedures was noted by Kirkpatrick  []. A more detailed explanation of the application of  to other genetic issues can be found  for example  in Fernández and Toro []. The implementation of the MGD method was done using a tailored program in FORTRAN. The  algorithm starts from an initial solution obtained by randomly separating individuals into  groups ( is predefined in each run of the algorithm) or assigning to each individual a random probability of belonging to each group  if the allele frequency option is selected. Alternative solutions consist in moving one of the individuals from its present cluster to a randomly selected group (when dealing with the molecular coancestry matrix) or in increasing by 0.1% the probability of belonging to one group and decreasing by 0.1% the probability for the same individual of belonging to another cluster. A restriction was included imposing that all groups include at least a representation from one individual. The values of the actual and the alternative solutions ( the averaged genetic distance calculated from whatever strategy considered) were calculated. Due to its nature   is a minimisation algorithm but the genetic distance is a parameter to be maximised. Therefore  the sign of both distances must be changed in order to find the desired optimum. Acceptance of the alternative solution occurred with a probability calculated as where  was the difference between values of the alternative and actual solutions and  was the present temperature in the particular cooling cycles. Fifty thousand alternative solutions were generated and tested. Afterwards  the value of  was reduced by a factor of . Another 50000 solutions were generated  the parameter  was reduced and so on. A maximum of 400 steps ( different values for ) were allowed. The rate of decrease in the cooling factor or temperature () and the initial temperature were set to 0.9 and 0.001  respectively  based on previous simulations performed to adjust the algorithm in this specific kind of data set. For each scenario  different  were tested  and for each   five replicates (starting from different initial solutions) were carried out  as a security measure  in order to avoid being stuck in non-optimal solutions; the replicate with the highest genetic distance was chosen for the grouping analysis. Each run of the program took between 1 to 8 hours to complete when the genetic distance was calculated from the molecular coancestry. However  if the genetic distance was calculated from the allele frequencies the computation time suffered a10-fold increase. In this paper  only the results obtained with the allele frequency strategy are presented  because both approaches showed similar accuracies in the tested situations. As for the likelihood in STRUCTURE  the values for the averaged genetic distance did not reach a clear maximum in a sensible range of successive  values ( continued increasing slightly after the true number of clusters had been reached). For this reason  a similar procedure as that proposed in Evanno  [] for STRUCTURE was implemented. It was based on the rate of change in the averaged genetic distance between successive  values (<U+0394>) calculated as where  is the averaged genetic distance in the optimal solution for a given . The inferred number of clusters corresponds to the value with the highest <U+0394>. Figure  shows values of genetic distance for the different  and the corresponding transformed values <U+0394> used to determine the correct grouping (values for 10 replicates of the same scenario).   . Example of ten replicates of a single scenario ( = 5). Another appealing objective of this study would have been to compare the results obtained with MGD and SAMOVA software since both are methods free of assumptions about the equilibriums and use a similar approach to perform the clusterisation. However  such an evaluation is not possible due because SAMOVA is a method that clusters populations whereas the MGD method clusters individuals  which makes any comparison between the two approaches difficult. To generate genotypic data  the EASYPOP software version 1.7 [] was used. The modelled organisms were diploid  hermaphroditic and randomly mated (excluding selfing  except when indicated). The population comprised five subpopulations with an equal number of individuals constant along the generations. A finite island model of migration was simulated  where each of the subpopulations exchanged migrants at a rate  = 0.01 per generation to a random chosen subpopulation. The simulated mutational model assumed equal probability of mutating to any allelic state (). Alleles at the base population were randomly assigned  and thus  frequencies of all alleles were initially equal. Free recombination was considered between loci. The evaluated populations covered a broad range of scenarios with various degrees of differentiation and depending on whether they were in mutation-migration-drift equilibrium or not. The parameter set for the simulations are summarised in Table . The parameters involved were the following: Individuals in each subpopulation: 20 or 100. Allelic states: 10 for the microsatellite-like markers and two for the SNP. Available molecular markers: 10 or 50 for the microsatellites and 60 or 300 for the SNP. Mutation rate: 10 for the microsatellite and 5 × 10 for the SNP. Number of generations elapsed since foundation: 20  1000 or 10000. Table  also shows the values for some diversity and Wright  statistics in each evaluated scenario. In addition  to test in depth the efficiency of the methods  some simulations were performed with modified scenarios involving several factors like the level of differentiation  the size or complexity of the metapopulation and the presence of Hardy-Weinberg and/or linkage disequilibrium (HWD and LD). The additional situations were the following: Scenario 2 with  = 0.05   = 0.07 and  = 0.10 to evaluate different values. Scenario 2 with 10 subpopulations ( = 10) and with 50 individuals in each subpopulation to test the efficiency of the algorithms when the number of clusters is large. In this scenario   values ranging from 5 to 15 were tested. Hierarchical island model (HIM) consists in five sets of four subpopulations  each made of 50 individuals. Migration occurs at a rate of 0.02 within a given archipelago and 0.001 between archipelagos. Fifty microsatellites and 300 SNP were tested for  values ranging from 2 to 23 both for STRUCTURE and MGD  and BAPS software was run setting the maximum number of clusters to 30 because in this scenario the total number of subpopulations could reach 20 (not just 5). Scenario 3 with a proportion of selfing equal to 0.3  0.5  0.7 and 0.9 to generate Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. Scenario 6 considering 1000 generations where migration was not allowed followed by 10 generations where  = 0.01 or  = 0.1. To generate linkage disequilibrium during the 1010 generations  the recombination rate between loci was set to 0.06. This value of recombination rate was calculated according to the Haldane mapping function [] considering a very small genome (around 20 centimorgans) in order to generate a tight linkage between each marker (300 SNP). Parameters corresponding to the above situations are given in Table . Ten replicated data sets were tested for all scenarios. GENEPOP software version 4.0.6 [] was used to analyse Hardy-Weinberg and/or linkage equilibrium (or disequilibrium) in scenarios 3 and 6. To compute HWE  the option  was chosen with the suboption of . The Wright  statistic []is provided. Regarding the LE  the option of the  was selected with the suboption of . A -value for each pair of loci is computed for all subpopulations (Fisher method)  and the high (or reduced) proportion of significant loci pairs ( < 0.05) with significant linkage is a measure of the LD (or LE). The data sets corresponding to scenarios 3 and 6 in Table  show no significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium (= 0.01 ± 0.01 and 0.00 ± 0.00 for scenarios 3 and 6  respectively). The mean proportions of significant loci pairs with significant linkage are 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.07 ± 0.00 for scenarios 3 and 6  respectively. The data sets corresponding to modified scenarios 3 and 6 in Table  show both significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. The mean values range from 0.15 ± 0.01 to 0.81 ± 0.02 in scenario 3. The mean proportions of significantly linked loci pairs are 0.35 ± 0.05  0.60 ± 0.08  0.88 ± 0.02 and 0.99 ± 0.00 with a proportion of selfing equal to 0.3  0.5  0.7 and 0.9  respectively. The mean values are 0.12 ± 0.02 and 0.02 ± 0.00 in scenario 6 with  = 0.01 and  = 0.1  respectively. The mean proportions of significantly linked loci pairs are 0.73 ± 0.01 and 0.22 ± 0.01 in scenario 6 with  = 0.01 and  = 0.1  respectively. As an example  to determine the relative influence of HWD and LD in the accuracy of the evaluated methods  the data of those replicates where both STRUCTURE and BAPS failed to estimate the correct number of clusters in scenario 3 with  = 0.7 and scenario 6 with  = 0.01 were randomised to re-establish HWE and/or LE. This procedure was implemented since HWD and LD could interfere in the performance of the Bayesian approaches. The expectation was that after the randomisation procedures the Bayesian approaches could perform better because HWE and LE are assumptions for both methodologies. Three alternatives were followed to randomise the data within subpopulations. First  an allele randomisation to re-establish HWE and LE in the data sets. Second  between loci genotypes were also randomised to maintain HWD while restoring LE. Finally  haplotypes were also taken haphazardly to evaluate the opposite situation (HWE and LD). GENEPOP confirmed Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium (or disequilibrium) after the randomisation of alleles  genotypes or haplotypes. To determine the performance of each method the number of inferred clusters () was evaluated through the modal value over replicates and  also  with the fraction of replicates where the estimated number of clusters was inferred to be the true number. A more detailed measure can be obtained as the proportion of individuals correctly grouped with their true population. This parameter was evaluated by averaging over clusters the highest proportion of each subpopulation ( larger group of individuals) located at the same cluster. This mean value was also averaged over replicates. The MGD method was also tested on a real data set of 1056 humans subdivided into 52 populations genotyped for 377 microsatellite loci obtained from . This data set was previously examined both with STRUCTURE [] and BAPS []. Since Rosenberg . [] ran STRUCTURE up to  = 6 we re-ran STRUCTURE for  = 7 with the parameters proposed by Rosenberg . [] to compare the results obtained from the three methodologies. The performances under the allelic frequency approach and the molecular coancestry approach where similar and  thus  only the former will be shown. The number of inferred clusters in each simulated scenario for the evaluated methods is given in Table . When the modal value was the comparison criterion  both STRUCTURE and MGD had an optimal behaviour in the simulated scenarios since they always yielded the true number of subpopulations. BAPS overestimated the number of populations when a reduced number of molecular information was available. When the fraction of replicates with the correct number of clusters estimated was the comparison parameter  MGD performed slightly better than BAPS and STRUCTURE. Generally  all methods increased their accuracy when a large number of markers were available and after a huge number of generations ( when mutation-migration-drift was reached). Figure  shows the averaged proportion of correct groupings over replicates. With all the methods more than 80% of the individuals were assigned to the correct cluster. However  a smaller percentage was observed with BAPS in situations with a reduced number of markers even if a large number of generations elapsed. In general  the MGD method performed slightly better  although there were no significant differences between the approaches across scenarios. . Bars represent standard errors; see Table 1 for the explanation of the scenarios. The influence of the different factors underlined above in the inference of the substructure is shown in Table . When modal values were compared  STRUCTURE performed better regarding the differentiation level (it always predicted the correct number of clusters)  whereas BAPS and MGD were equivalent and underestimated  when  = 0.10. Contrarily  when  = 10  BAPS and MGD performed better than STRUCTURE. In HIM  both STRUCTURE and MGD indicate five clusters and BAPS gives an overestimation. It should be pointed out that  although the highest <U+0394> in this scenario was obtained for  = 5 under MGD  a smaller 'peak' was observed for  = 20  and thus it also detected the structure at the lower level (data not shown). BAPS also overestimated the number of clusters in HWD and LD situations  while STRUCTURE and MGD yielded similar results in HWD situations. MGD performed better than STRUCTURE in LD situations. When the fraction of replicates with the correct number of estimated clusters was the comparison parameter  the best performance was obtained with STRUCTURE at relative reduced levels of differentiation between subpopulations (at  = 0.10  in 90% of the replicates  = 5). Both BAPS and MGD performed poorly at low levels of (see Table ). However  when  = 10  MGD was better than BAPS and STRUCTURE. In the HIM  MGD always found five clusters but the performance of STRUCTURE was reduced. BAPS never ascertained the correct number of clusters. In the scenarios where HWD and LD were presented  BAPS never obtained the correct number of clusters. MGD performed slightly better than STRUCTURE in LD situations. However  in HWD situations  the behaviours of STRUCTURE and MGD were quite similar depending on the evaluated proportion of selfing. The averaged proportion of correct groupings across the clusters with the highest membership for scenarios simulating different migration rates   = 10  HIM  HWD and LD situations is shown in Figure . BAPS software presented a higher accuracy for all the tested differentiation levels. In the same context  no important differences were detected between STRUCTURE and MGD  though the former had a better behaviour at  = 0.10. The same relative performance was observed for scenario 2 and  = 10. In HIM  no significant differences were detected between STRUCTURE and MGD  while with BAPS a reduced proportion of correct groupings was obtained. In HWD situations no significant differences were detected between STRUCTURE and MGD  although the latter performed better. On the contrary  again with BAPS a reduced proportion of correct groupings was obtained. In LD situations  MGD performed better than STRUCTURE and BAPS.   . Mean proportion of correct groupings over replicates for each simulated migration rate () and a higher number of subpopulations ( = 10) in scenario 2; hierarchical island model (HIM) with 50 microsatellites and 300 SNP; scenario 3 with selfing (0.3  0.5  0.7 and 0.9) to generate Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD) and in scenario 6 with linked loci (recombination rate = 0.06) and 1000 generations with no migration between subpopulations and 10 generations where  = 0.01 or  = 0.1 to generate linkage disequilibrium (LD); bars represent standard errors; see Table 1 for the explanation of the scenarios. In three replicates of the modified scenario 3 with  = 0.7 (simulated to generate HWD) and in two replicates of the modified scenario 6 with  = 0.01 (simulated to generate LD)  STRUCTURE failed to estimate the correct number of clusters  as shown in Table  (= 0.36 ± 0.10 and the mean proportion of significant loci pairs with significant linkage was 0.77 ± 0.05). Thus  these five replicates were selected as an example for the randomisation procedure to re-establish HWE and/or LE. It should be noted that BAPS failed to infer the real number of clusters in all the replicates. Then  in these five replicates  both Bayesian methods were unsuccessful. For those cases  MGD inferred five clusters except for one replicate (three clusters were determined instead) and that pattern did not change due to the randomisation. In general  when alleles were randomised  the methods estimated the number of clusters correctly (except in one replicate with STRUCTURE) and also gave a high percentage of correct groupings (above the 98%) because HWE and LE were reached (= - 0.01 ± 0.01 and the mean proportion of significant loci pairs with significant linkage was 0.04 ± 0.02). When only LD was present (haplotype randomisation  = 0.00 ± 0.01 and the mean proportion of significant loci pairs with significant linkage was 0.68 ± 0.06)  BAPS always overestimated the number of clusters (STRUCTURE overestimated  only in one replicate) and gave a mean proportion of correct groupings of 0.82 ± 0.02. When the genotypes were randomised in the modified scenario 3 (any LD removed  = 0.36 ± 0.10 and the mean proportion of significant loci pairs with significant linkage was 0.02 ± 0.01)  BAPS still overestimated the number of clusters but with a greater proportion of correct groupings of 0.87 ± 0.06. The MGD method always gave a percentage of correct groupings above 98%  whatever the randomisation option (data not shown). A schematic representation of the correspondence between the inferred population structure and the geographic regions in the real data set using STRUCTURE []  BAPS [] and MGD is shown in Figure . The results provided by STRUCTURE suggest that the optimal structure comprised five groups that seemed to correspond well to five major geographic regions excluding an outlier  the Kalash population. When  = 7  STRUCTURE separated Central-South Asia. BAPS results coincided closely with the results obtained with STRUCTURE; however  it suggests a separation in more groups  allocating the populations from America in three divergent groups. The MGD partition was  in general  equal to STRUCTURE for  = 2 to  = 4  with this value being optimal under the new method. When  = 5  STRUCTURE distinguished Oceania while MGD divided Central-South Asia. If  = 6  MGD separated the Middle East completely. When  = 7  MGD suggested the seven main evaluated geographic regions (Africa  Europe  Middle East  Central-South Asia  East Asia  Oceania and America). . STRUCTURE results taken from Rosenberg  [] and BAPS results from Corander  []; MGD: maximisation of the genetic distance method  : number of inferred clusters  : population size; each box corresponds to a geographical region and the width of the boxes indicates graphically the number of genotyped individuals; Af: Africa ( = 119)  E: Europe ( = 161)  ME: Middle East ( = 178)  CSA: Central-South Asia ( = 210)  EA: East Asia ( = 241)  O: Oceania ( = 39)  Am: America ( = 108)  Kal: Kalash ( = 25)  Kar: Karitiana ( = 24)  S: Surui ( = 21); black lines separate regional affiliations (on the top of the figure) of the individuals; for each analysed  the partition obtained with each methodology is represented with  different colours. Clustering approaches allow the partition of a sample of individuals into genetically distinct groups without an  definition of these groups. Most of the recent advances in clustering methodology have been made using Bayesian statistical models [        ]. Bayesian methods assign individuals to groups based on their genotypes and the assumption that the markers are in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium within each subpopulation. In this study  a new method was used to infer the hidden structure in a population  based on the maximisation of the genetic distance and not making any assumption on HWE and LE  and we show that it yields a good performance under different simulated scenarios and with a real data set. Therefore  it could be a useful tool to determine genetically homogeneous groups  especially in those situations where the number of clusters is high  with complex population structure and where HWD and/or LD are present. The simulation results indicate that the BAPS method is the least precise since it needed a large number of genotyped markers to reach the correct partition  especially when the population had reached the mutation-migration-drift equilibrium. For the original/basic scenarios  the performances of MGD and STRUCTURE were similar (good) whatever the parameter of comparison  although the new method presented a slight advantage (see Table  and Figure ). We have shown that departures from the implicit assumptions in the Bayesian methods about the Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium within populations affect their accuracy  especially for BAPS  leading to an overestimated number of clusters and a reduced proportion of correct groupings. These observations are in agreement with Kaeuffer  [] who have shown that a high LD correlation coefficient value increases the probability of detecting spurious clustering with STRUCTURE. The randomisation of alleles (and also the randomisation of genotypes and haplotypes to some extent) re-establishes both HWE and LE. In these situations  the two methods evaluate correctly the number of clusters and give an increased proportion of correct groupings. On the contrary  MGD is more precise in disequilibrium situations and its performance does not change significantly after the randomisation  demonstrating the independence of the novel method from the existence or not of HWE and LE. From the results presented here  an alternative to test the accuracy of the results from any clustering method would be to compare the results obtained after the randomisation of the molecular information within each pre-defined subpopulation when this information is available. The precision of all three methods is excellent for as low as 0.03. This is in agreement with the results of Latch  []  who have proven that STRUCTURE and BAPS discern the population substructure extremely well at = 0.02 - 0.03. However  in our simulations only STRUCTURE determines the correct number of clusters at = 0.01. Notwithstanding  there is a controversy about the minimum differentiation level necessary for a population to be considered as genetically structured. Waples and Gaggiotti [] have suggested that if is too reduced (= 0.01) then it probably cannot be associated with statistically significant evidence for departures from panmixia. In these situations  it is not clear if the most appropriate solution for MGD (and also the other clustering methodologies) is to separate different subpopulations or to maintain the subpopulations as an undifferentiated population. The simulated scenarios taking into account different selfing rates indicated both an increase in differentiation between subpopulations ( higher values) and an increase in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (moves from 0.01 to 0.81). However  the increase in values (from 0.27 to 0.42) are are not as great as that of the values indicating that the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium can not be masked by the effect of the differentiation level. In addition  the increase in values should help to distinguish the different clusters and  therefore  the HWD should reach at least the lowest limit of its effect. Our results obtained with the MGD method from the human data set are  in general  similar to those obtained with STRUCTURE [] and also in concordance with a more recent study of 525910 SNP []  although some discrepancies exist with the results of Li  [] using 650000 SNP. Rosemberg . [] have indicated multiple clustering solutions for  = 7 with STRUCTURE. However  the results obtained with MGD for  = 7 are in complete agreement with the seven geographical regions. A careful inspection of the results detects clusters where grouped individuals have multiple sources of ancestry  especially those in the Middle East and Central-South Asia. This situation ( the estimated mixed ancestry) could be due either to recent admixture or to shared ancestry before the divergence of two populations but without subsequent gene flow between them. It has been indicated that global human genetic variation is greatly influenced by geography [–]. In addition  Serre and Pääbo [] have indicated that the clusters obtained by Rosenberg . [] have been generated by heterogeneous sampling and that these would disappear if more populations were analysed. In this study  a simple island model with constant population sizes and invariant symmetrical migration has been considered  which are unlikely in natural systems. The performance of STRUCTURE has been recently evaluated [] by simulating various dispersal scenarios and it seems to perform well with more complex population structures than the finite island model (hierarchical island model  contact zone model). In this study  the performance of the MGD method was better than that of the Bayesian approaches in the simulated scenarios with a higher number of clusters and a more complex population structure. However  further investigations are required to determine the capacity of the MGD method to deal with other kinds of population structure. Computation time may be a limitation of the new method  especially when dealing with large amounts of markers. However  it should be noted that clustering analysis is not performed very often and the results are not usually needed urgently. Therefore  it may be worthwhile to wait for the results obtained with the most accurate method. If the genetic distance calculated from the molecular coancestry has been evaluated as an alternative  then the use of other genetic distances previously published in the literature [] could be investigated as the parameter to maximise both for codominant and dominant molecular markers. Moreover  the Nei minimum distance [] could be inappropriate when working with various markers  for example when mixing data obtained with markers with different heterozygosis levels ( mixing microsatellite and SNP data). In addition  a weighting procedure [  ] could also be implemented taking into account the subpopulation size  the number of loci or the number of alleles. Notwithstanding  the nature of the new method ( the maximisation of the genetic distance) allows for the use of any measure which could better fit the available molecular data  beyond the Nei distance. The informativity of the markers has a clear effect on the efficiency of the clustering methods  especially for BAPS. Increasing the number of markers (scenario 1 vs. 2  3 vs. 4  5 vs. 6 and 7 vs. 8) almost always yields better results: the correct number of clusters is estimated in more cases and the percentage of correct groupings is higher. In parallel  when comparing a similar number of markers but with different degrees of polymorphism (scenario 2 vs. 5  microsatellites vs. SNP) the biallelic markers yield worse performances. Notwithstanding  when using a reasonable number of markers (50 microsatelites and 300 SNP) MGD and STRUCTURE  at least  provide a high accuracy. However  when comparing results obtained with STRUCTURE  it is surprising that this method showed less accuracy with 10 microsatellites than with 50 microsatellites. Although in the present work the method has been developed for co-dominant markers  whatever the approach (molecular coancestry or allelic frequencies)  the methodology can also be easily extended to dominant molecular markers by replacing the molecular coancestry matrix with a matrix of any available measure of similarity for dominant markers [] or estimating the allelic frequencies from recessives (see [] and references therein) and then using the typical genetic distances. The present formulation of the method does not explicitly account for the presence of admixed individuals. To do so  a different set of probabilities should be given to each locus in each individual (in the allelic frequencies approach) allowing for each locus to be assigned to different clusters. The increase in computation time and the ability of the optimisation algorithm to deal with a larger space of solutions deserve further investigations. A compiled file of the code used to infer the number of clusters and the assignment of the individuals to each cluster in a given sample from the molecular coancestry matrix or the allele frequencies will be available on the web site . In this study  a new method to infer the hidden structure in a population  based on the maximisation of the genetic distance and without making any assumption on HWE and LE  performed well under different simulated scenarios and with a real data set. Therefore  this could be a useful tool to determine genetically homogeneous groups  especially in those situations where the number of clusters is high  with complex population structure and where HWD and/or LD are present.

From a breeding and production viewpoint  milk yield persistency and total milk yield are important traits. Understanding the genetic drivers for the phenotypic variation of both these traits could provide a means for improving these traits in commercial production. It has been shown that Natural Cubic Smoothing Splines (NCSS) can model the features of lactation curves with greater flexibility than the traditional parametric methods. NCSS were used to model the sire effect on the lactation curves of cows. The sire solutions for persistency and total milk yield were derived using NCSS and a whole-genome approach based on a hierarchical model was developed for a large association study using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Estimated sire breeding values (EBV) for persistency and milk yield were calculated using NCSS. Persistency EBV were correlated with peak yield but not with total milk yield. Several SNP were found to be associated with both traits and these were used to identify candidate genes for further investigation. NCSS can be used to estimate EBV for lactation persistency and total milk yield  which in turn can be used in whole-genome association studies. For dairy producers  the accurate description of lactation curves is a valuable tool for selection and management. Lactation curves provide a description of milk yield performance  which make it possible to predict total milk yield from a single or several test days early in lactation. Thus  producers can make early management decisions based on the predicted individual production. Different mathematical equations have been proposed to model lactation curves. Usually such curves are modelled using parametric models with fixed or random coefficients  for example random regression models  Wood's Lactation Curve (the commonly applied gamma equations)  Wilmink's Curve and Legendre polynomials. Alternatively  mechanistic models which describe the lactation curves based on the biology of lactation have been used []. In 1999  White and colleagues [] proposed and demonstrated that Natural Cubic Smoothing Splines (NCSS) can model the features of lactation curves with greater flexibility than the traditional parametric methods. This has been further supported by the work of Druet and colleagues []. In addition  NCSS are particularly useful in an animal breeding setting since they can be incorporated into linear mixed models. A lactation curve describes many important features of lactation and some of these features  namely time to peak  total milk yield and rate of decline after the peak yield  were examined in this study. The rate of decline in milk production after peak yield is the typical definition of milk yield persistency. High persistency is characterized by a slow rate of decline after peak yield  while low persistency is characterized by a high rate of decline after peak yield. Persistency has been reported to have a significant economic impact []. Highly persistent cows or cows with a flat lactation curve are reported to be more profitable because of fewer health and reproductive problems with less energy imbalance. The links between health disorders  fertility and persistency have been investigated with varied results [  ]. Total milk yield is a well-known economically important trait. However  selection for high total milk yield has been shown to have detrimental health effects []. If an animal has a low persistency  selection for high milk yield can cause significant metabolic stress. In 2004  Muir and colleagues [] have reported that selection for increased persistency might increase total yields without increasing disease incidences or fertility problems. Subsequently  Togashi and Lin [  ] have investigated different selection strategies to maximize milk yield without decreasing persistency. Although the definition of persistency is now generally agreed upon  methods of estimation still vary. In 1996  Gengler [] provided a review of many common definitions of persistency  which included ratios of an early test day or period to late-lactation test-day or period and measures formulated to be independent of total yield. Other reported measures are the difference between one set day for peak yield (or the estimated breeding value (EBV) at this day) early in lactation and a test day late in lactation (or EBV at this day)  or the sum of the yield or EBV over this time period. Novel approaches for calculating persistency have been presented by Druet and colleagues [] and Togashi and Lyn []. Cole and VanRaden [] and Cole and Null [] have shown that routine genetic evaluations are feasible for persistency. Some of these methods assume one set day for peak yield for all animals  which in reality is not the case. Using NCSS allows the exact estimation of a unique peak day and yield at peak for each animal. Many QTL and association studies have been conducted for total milk yield and a few QTL studies have investigated persistency. Such studies usually involved either the use of single markers or a genome scan to establish association with a specific trait. Whole-genome approaches have been developed  for example genetic random variable elimination (GeneRaVE) [  ] and whole-genome average interval mapping (WGAIM) []. Whole-genome methods allow for background genetic effects by incorporating all markers  and thus all the associations between marker and trait are estimated simultaneously. The first objective of this paper was to demonstrate that NCSS could be used successfully to estimate sire breeding values for two important features of the lactation curve  persistency and total milk yield  for a specific set of sires in a large Australian study. The second objective was to conduct an association study for both persistency and total milk yield using the calculated EBV  genotype information in the form of 7541 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and a maternal grandsire pedigree. The overall aim was to use a whole-genome association study to establish marker-trait associations. Genotypic information was available for 383 Holstein Friesian (HF) progeny-tested bulls  which were selected on the basis of either high or low estimated breeding values for the Australian selection index. The index's primary emphasis is on protein production. Data on all these bulls' daughters and their contemporaries were extracted from the Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS) database. The data set consisted of Holstein Friesian cows that calved during the period 1983 to 2006 and were in the same herd year and season as the daughters of the 383 genotyped sires. Records were removed when calving date was missing or when the test date was outside the 5 to 305 d in milk (DIM) period. Only first lactations were included since it has been demonstrated that genetic correlations for persistency between consecutive parities are high [] (> 0.85 reported between the first two parities) despite previous results disagreeing with this study (see [] for discussion of results). This data set contained over 15 millions test day records from the daughters of 38 381 sires in 6 384 herds and thus was too large for use in a single analysis. In order to provide an unbiased analysis  six random samples were selected from the full data set by randomly sampling 1 000 herds [  ]; each sampled herd had to contain at least 1 000 test day records. Each sample contained approximately 15 000 to 20 000 sires and 400 000 to 450 000 cows. These six sub-samples were used for the estimation of the variance components in the model discussed below. A selected data set was created and consisted of data concerning only the specific 383 sires of interest and their offspring. This data set contained 333 068 Holstein Friesian daughters with 2 311 834 records and was used to estimate the sire effect EBV for persistency and total milk yield (incorporating information based on the six sub-samples). A maternal-grandsire pedigree dating back to 1940 and consisting of 2864 animals was available for the 383 sires. A total of 9918 SNP markers were scored on the 383 sires using Parallele (Affymetrix  Santa Clara  CA). After adjusting for monomorphic SNP  missing genotypes  unknown location  minimum allele frequency (> 2.5%) and deviation of observed genotype frequencies from expected frequencies calculated from allele frequencies (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium)  the number of polymorphic markers amounted to 7541 with an average of 251 SNP per chromosome (29 autosomes plus one sex chromosome). The remaining missing values in the SNP information were replaced by their expected value calculated using haplotypes of five SNP markers []. NCSS were used to model the sire influence on lactation curves of dairy cows in the randomly sampled data and also in the selected data set. The randomly selected data sets were used to estimate variance components in the model discussed below. The six sets of estimates were averaged and all but one (as discussed later) of the variances components were fixed at their average value in the analysis of the selected data set. The aim was to reduce the bias in using the selected data by ensuring that the variance component estimates reflected those that would be obtained if the full data was analysed. For the analysis on the selected data  the main features of the lactation curves were extracted. The sire's influence on the peak lactation milk yield and the corresponding day of peak milk yield were estimated  and for each sire  the EBV for persistency and total milk yield were subsequently computed. This constituted the first stage of analysis. Then  the EBV for persistency and total milk yield were used in the second stage association study. Appropriate weights were calculated for the second stage analyses  reflecting the information available for each sire. A discussion of weights for two-stage analysis has been presented by Smith and colleagues [] in the context of plant breeding but the methods are more widely applicable and relevant for the analyses conducted in this paper. A mixed model was used for both the sampled and selected test day data  namely The vector  is the  1 vector of test-day milk yields on the cows in both the randomly sampled and the selected data sets. The fixed effects were given by   and consisted of trends for the age of cow at test (a fixed effects cubic polynomial) and a fixed effect for year by season; a factor of 46 levels representing year by season interactions. The random effects in the model included herd-test-day effects represented by (with design matrix )  independent effects with mean zero and variance   and the random cubic orthogonal polynomial regression coefficients for the  cows in the data are given by (with design matrix )  with mean zero and variance matrix  ; is a 4 × 4 variance matrix ( is the Kronecker product). The random cubic regression using orthogonal polynomials was included to model cow lactation across the repeated measures of milk yield over the lactation period and it incorporates permanent environmental effects and genetic effects since the maternal grandsire pedigree was not included in the stage I model. It would have been preferable to include the pedigree in this first stage of modelling  especially if EBV were of prime interest since they would then reflect relationships between sires  but we were unable to do so due to limitations in computing power. However  the pedigree was used in the association analysis discussed and presented below. All random effects were assumed to have a normal distribution and to be mutually independent. The error term was assumed independently distributed as (0  ). The term  represents the sire effects on lactation over time. Thus  is a design matrix for the sire of cow effect. The vector  is the vector of sire contributions to the lactation curves of the cows. Thus  can be partitioned into components that correspond to individual sires; that is  for the 383 sires for the selected data set. The contribution to the lactation curve of cows for the  th sire  was modelled using NCSS [  ]  that is ( = 1  2  ...  383) as where the spline is represented by a fixed linear (or straight line) component    and a correlated random component    to allow for nonlinear patterns in the lactation curve attributable to sires. Note that ~(  ) uses the formulation of Verbyla and colleagues []  where  is the variance component for the random component of the NCSS and  is the number of knot-points for the NCSS. The same knot points were used for all sires. The full design matrices for  and  in (1) become respectively  = ( ) and = ( ) for the 383 sires in the selected data set. Notice that the cow random coefficients and NCSS provide for the variance-covariance structure that would arise because of repeated measurements on the individual cows. The full model is given by and the marginal distribution of  is therefore given by where  =  + are the fixed effects  and the variance matrix  is given by It was possible to fit this model  whereas more complex models (for example allowing for splines for each cow) were simply too large to be fitted. The key component of the statistical model is the NCSS  one for each sire. This term formed the basis of the analysis of the milk yield characteristics that were influenced by the choice of sire. Once the mixed model (3) is fitted  the sire NCSS can be used to determine the peak milk yield  the time at which the peak occurs  milk yield persistency  and total milk yield over the full lactation. Some basic results involving NCSS are required in order to determine peak yield  persistency and total milk yield. The first derivative is required to determine the day of peak milk yield. NCSS can then be used to find the peak milk yield value for each sire. The total milk yield is the area under the NCSS for each sire and requires integration of the NCSS. Suppose we have a quantitative explanatory variable  with corresponding values or knot-points < =  = ... = <on an interval [  ]. In our context  this variable is DIM  and the interval is [6 305]. Selection of the knot points is discussed below. Suppose that g() is the value of the NCSS for the  th sire at the knot-point   which represents one value of the vector . To simplify the notation we drop the subscript . Green and Silverman [] have shown that the values = () and the second derivatives = \"() at the knot points characterize the NCSS; note that  = = 0. In fact  for =  = and = -   While the terms in (4) do not match the formulation in (2)  White and colleagues [] have shown the equivalence of various forms on the NCSS. Equation () is useful in fitting models in statistical software packages  whereas (4) is useful for post-fitting calculations. Several results are needed to develop the second stage of the analysis  namely the association study. Equation () can be written as where  and  are vectors of the and   respectively  and  and  are known vectors explicitly defined using (4)  and which are equal to zero  apart from the two indices  and  + 1. Using equation (.4) of []  we can then write where  and  are known matrices given on pages 12 and 13 of [];  and  are functions of . Thus any value of the function  can be found using the values at the knot points. Using (4)  the first derivative of () can be shown to be (=  = ) where and Equation () is used to determine the time for maximum or peak milk yield. Typically  there is a single maximum or peak milk yield day at which . The first step is to use the spline to determine the interval containing the peak milk yield. In most cases  the interval containing peak values has first derivatives at the knot points satisfying  and  where the hat indicates the estimated ; if there is no turning point in the lactation curve  the maximum will occur at the initial time point and there will not be any interval satisfying the inequalities. Once the interval containing the maximum milk yield is determined  the equation  is solved and involves finding the acceptable root of the quadratic equation (). Estimated persistency was calculated as the difference between the milk yield at peak lactation and an end day  namely where  and are the time of peak milk yield and the end time (= 305 DIM) respectively. The time period differs between sires because of differing peak lactation times . The estimated milk yields  and  were calculated for each sire using (4). Both variability of the actual time of peak yield attributable to sires and difference in persistency were examined using a fixed time (60 DIM). Relationships between peak lactation time  peak lactation value  lactation at the end of the lactation period  persistency and total milk yield were also examined. The total milk yield for cows attributable to sires was found by calculating the area under the NCSS for each sire. The area under the curve can be found by integration  and using (4) it is easy to show Evaluation of (8) for each sire involves using estimates of and   and using the same arguments leading to (5)  can be written in terms of  at the knot-points as where the  vectors are functions of as given in (8). The association analyses are conducted in the second stage of the analysis. However  the 'data' for the second stage are estimates or predictions from stage 1 and hence have an associated error that should be carried through to the next stage of analysis. These estimates are also correlated  but to provide a simple analysis  an approximation along the lines of [  ] is carried out. The weights are determined as follows. The predicted persistency involves finding  and . Thus for a single sire  and using (5)  where  is a known vector. The variance matrix of   which we denote by   is available via the prediction error variance matrix  and the underlying spline variance matrix as outlined []. If is the matrix whose rows are given by   and using the ideas in [  ]  our weights are given by the diagonal elements of the inverse of the full variance matrix of the persistency estimates. Note that (10) ignores the error associated with estimating . The same argument was used to develop weights for the total milk yield estimates using (9). We examined additive SNP marker associations for both persistency and total milk yield using the methods of Kiverii [  ] with a component of the method discussed by Verbyla and colleagues []. Including the polygenic effects using the maternal-grandsire pedigree  with the resulting additive relationship matrix  was also shown to be important. The statistical model for marker-trait association was given by where is the vector of estimated effects for a single trait (m stands for persistency or total milk yield) from the first stage of the analysis   is a vector of 'ones'   is an overall mean effect  is a matrix of additive SNP scores (see below) with associated size vector    is a vector of (polygenic) additive random effects with distribution   where  is derived from the full maternal grandsire pedigree and is a residual vector distributed as  where is a diagonal matrix of weights derived from the first stage of the analysis using (10). Note that is a known matrix for this second stage of the analysis and is different for each of the two traits  persistency and total milk yield. The additive () scores for a SNP with alleles  and  are given by -1 for genotype   0 for genotype  and 1 for genotype . Thus contains the scores for each SNP for each sire. The GeneRaVE or genetic random variable elimination approach presented by Kiiveri [  ] was used for the analysis without the polygenic effects . The current theory and implementation of GeneRaVE does not allow random effects to be included. Ideally the polygenic effects should be included. Indeed ignoring them would produce a biased selection since it is likely that truly non-significant markers would be selected because the between sire stratum of variation is omitted. However  in order to at least partially correct for the bias  a further stage of analysis is described below. Thus for selection of SNP markers  (11) became If is the size of the effect of the  th SNP  the model developed in [  ] was so that the size effects conditional on a variance parameter () follow a normal distribution and hence are random effects. The variances were assumed to follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter  and scale parameter . This formulation leads to a complex marginal distribution for which is a function of ||. The dependence on the modulus leads to sparse regression variable selection by enabling estimates of size to be exactly zero. In practice  this was accomplished by setting equal to zero if the absolute magnitude was below 10. To control for false positives  a 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to find optimal values for the parameters  and . An additional scale parameter can also be optimised in the cross-validation. This parameter scales the response so that the threshold of 10 is relative to a common scale over different traits. The cross-validation involved sub-dividing the data into 10 random groups  leaving out each group in turn  and predicting the response for that group using the SNP selection process with the nine remaining groups as the data set. The minimum mean square error of prediction across all cross-validations was used as the criterion for selecting    and the scale (denoted  0 in the GeneRaVE documentation and in the results section). In 2007  Verbyla and colleagues [] presented a method for QTL analysis using a forward selection approach with a simpler random effects model for the sizes. The variances were assumed to be equal and non-random. In their approach  QTL were moved to the fixed effects part of the model since they were determined. In this paper  we used Kiiveri's [  ] selection approach in conjunction with the approach reported by Verbyla and colleagues []  which consists of moving the complete set of selected SNP to the fixed effects part of the model. The non-selected SNP were omitted in subsequent analyses. At this point  we were also able to include the pedigree information. Thus equation () was used for the final analysis  but was the vector of sizes only for the selected SNP and the matrix contained the additive scores only for the selected SNP. The significance of the selected SNP was conducted using a standard Wald statistic  namely the estimated SNP size effect divided by the corresponding standard error. Approximate p-values were determined using a standard normal distribution. The resulting significant SNP were used with NCBI  build Btau_4.0 to construct a list of possible candidate genes []. The statistical model given by (3) was fitted using ASREML [] and included lactation curves attributable to the sires in the sub-sampled and selected (383 sires) data sets. The spline term in (3) is automatically constructed by ASREML using the approach outlined in []. In ASREML  the knot points used for the NCSS are usually the unique values of the explanatory variable and in this case it would have been each observed DIM. Typically such a dense set of knot points is not necessary. By reducing the number of knot-points  computation and time requirements were kept reasonable. The number and their placement are often empirical  although White and colleagues [] have suggested that eight knot points is usually sufficient for modelling lactation curves. Druet and colleagues [] have used six knot points successfully. The knot points were positioned at a subset of 6  36  66  96  126  156  186  231  261 and 305 DIM. These knot points were selected empirically on the basis of the expected shape of the lactation curve. The number of knot points examined was 6  8 and 10. Parameter estimates and predictions based on the model were used for comparison  and it was found that six knot points were sufficient for an accurate representation of the lactation curve. Interestingly  log-likelihoods varied across the number of knot points used  but the stability of parameter estimates was clear for six and eight knot points. The final knot points selected were 6  36  96  156  231  and 305 DIM. Estimates of persistency and total milk yield were based on the lactation curves obtained using ASREML and were programmed for calculation in R []. This included determination of the interval containing the turning point using (6)  the calculation of the day at which peak lactation occurred  also using (6)  and the peak milk yield using (4). This enabled the sire component of persistency using (7) to be estimated. The area under the lactation curve as given by (8) was also calculated in the R language. The R code includes the calculation of necessary weights for stage two of the analysis  namely the determination of marker-trait association. The R code is available from the authors. GeneRaVE is available as the R package RChip from Mathematical and Information Sciences at CSIRO  and this package was used for selection of markers. The subsequent fitting of selected markers as fixed effects using (11) was carried out using ASREML []. The six random samples were used to estimate the variance components for the selected data set analysis. The results of these six analyses were very similar  the differences reflecting the sampling variation. The mean of the variance component over the six random samples for the herd test day was  = 7.00  while the residual variance had a mean of  = 4.115. To determine the cubic orthogonal polynomial random regressions covariance matrix for cows over DIM  the estimated matrices obtained from the analyses of the six random samples were averaged and this average is given in Table  (with estimated correlations between the components of the random regression given above the diagonal). These values (   and the values in Table ) were fixed in the analysis of the selected data set using only the daughters of the 383 sires and the same mixed model. However  the variance component for the spline term in (3) was estimated using the selected data since the focus was on the variation among the 383 sires. The estimated variance component for the spline component was  = 2.93. In the analysis of the selected data  we found that the estimated milk yield rises to a peak for 369 of the 383 sires and then gradually declines. For the remaining 14 sires  peak yield was estimated to occur at the initial time of 6 DIM. The fitted NCSS for the impact of sire on milk yield are presented in Figure  for a (random) subset of 30 sires. The variation in milk yield that is attributable to sires is well illustrated in Figure . The estimated lactation curves in Figure  all display a decline in milk production post-peak. The post-peak declines vary  and hence display a varying level of persistence. Using a mathematical model for such a diversity of curves could prove to be very restrictive and may miss features found using NCSS. . Potentially  a key aspect of persistency is the timing of peak milk yield. A histogram of the time of peak yield is given in Figure  and illustrates the considerable variation (from about 15 to 70 DIM) across sires with a mean time of approximately 40 DIM  rather than 60 DIM which is often used to estimate persistency. Note the single sire outlier at 150 DIM for peak yield. This sire produced an extremely flat lactation curve and was highly persistent after the peak. Persistency was also calculated using the fixed time of 60 DIM for comparison purposes. . The estimated persistency values (using the actual peak) for the sire effects are presented as a histogram in Figure . The distribution showed some skewness to the right indicating that several sires exhibit good persistency (low values)  while some sires lead to larger persistency values. . The estimated persistency values based on the estimated peak yield were plotted against the corresponding persistency using the 60 DIM milk yields as the maximum in Figure . There was a very strong correlation (0.97) between the two measures. Despite the strong correlation  Figure  shows some scatter and re-ranking of values. Notice also that using 60 DIM resulted in a downward bias in terms of estimated persistency (almost all values were below the  =  line presented). Hence  while the choice of peak DIM may not be totally critical  we favour using the estimated peak whenever possible. However  due to the high correlation between the two measures  the use of the 60 DIM peak yield would seem sufficient in cases where the extra complexity and computational demands cannot be justified. . The figure shows the relationship between the measures of persistency calculated using the estimated actual peak yield for each individual animal and using the fixed 60 DIM yield as peak yield for all animals. The definition of persistency used in this paper is one of many possible definitions. Because the peak in milk yield varies across sires  the total time period that defines persistency varies. To examine the impact of the definition of persistency  two further analyses were conducted. First  a fixed time span of 200 days post-peak was used to define persistency. The raw sample correlation between this fixed span persistency and our original measure of persistency was 0.88 while it was 0.90 with the fixed 60 DIM. In the second analysis the original persistency was divided by the time span. The correlation in this case was 0.91 using the estimated peak and 0.99 using 60 DIM. These results suggest a level of consistency across the various definitions of persistency. The estimated areas or total milk yields are presented in a histogram in Figure . The distribution may be a mixture of a number of components. There may be a genetic reason for this pattern due to the pedigree or SNP markers. . The relationships between estimated time to peak  estimated peak value  estimated final value (305 d)  estimated persistency and estimated total milk yield (Area) are presented in Figure . Total milk yield showed little correlation with persistency. In 2009  Cole and VanRaden [] reported a similarly small correlation (0.03). It has been shown in previous studies  that the correlation found between total milk yield and persistency is highly variable and dependent on the definition of persistency with both positive and negative correlations  ranging from less than 0 to over 0.50 [  ]. . Relationships between peak time  peak yield  yield at 305 d in milk  persistency and total milk yield based on the natural smoothing spline model are plotted and the correlation between these features is also displayed. The DIM of peak yield showed little correlation with any other variable  other than a small positive correlation with total milk yield. DIM of peak yield has been reported as correlated to persistency []  however in our study  peak yield rather than time of peak yield was highly correlated with persistency (0.53). The definition used here for persistency states that a lower value for persistency indicates a flat lactation curve and a more highly persistent cow. The positive correlation means that the higher the peak the greater the decrease in yield after the peak (low persistency). This result clearly indicates that animals with a lower peak yield are more persistent. This could be explained by a resultant reduction in metabolic stress  in agreement with the findings of Dekkers and colleagues []. Figure  also shows that a lower peak generally occurs in conjunction with a more gradual decline in predicted milk production  resulting in a more persistent animal. Peak yield was also positively correlated with final milk yield (0.45) and total milk yield (0.72). A high correlation between peak yield and final milk yield has been previously reported []. Overall our results support some previous findings  such as peak yield being directly linked to persistency. A higher peak generally means an animal will have a lower persistency. Our findings do not support a correlation between peak DIM and persistency but this may be due to the definition used for persistency here. In the GeneRaVE analysis of persistency  the three tuning parameters were set at  = 10   = 0 and  0 = 0.02 after cross-validation. All three parameters force effects to zero   0 being a scaling factor to help achieve a sparse solution. With these settings (which achieved a low mean squared prediction error) 51 SNP were selected for association with persistency. The selected 51 SNP were moved to the fixed effects part of the model and the remainder of the SNP were discarded. Since a maternal-grandsire pedigree was available for the 383 sires  this was incorporated in the subsequent analysis using (11) with the selected SNP. The estimate of the additive genetic variance was  = 0.76  compared to an average estimated error variance of 0.42; it should be noted that for the association study fixed weights and hence estimated variances from the stage 1 analysis were used at the residual level. Since these vary across sires  an average value is presented to provide an indication of the relative size of additive genetic and residual variation. The pedigree effects have a profound impact on the significance of the selected SNP  because they ensure the appropriate error in testing for significance. The standard errors of the estimated SNP effects when the pedigree was included were two to three times larger than when the pedigree was ignored. Unfortunately  it is not currently possible to include random effects in a GeneRaVE analysis but research is underway to do so. The final 18 SNP that were significant at the 0.10 level are shown in Table . Figure  is a plot of the persistency EBV calculated using the NCSS against the predicted marker assisted breeding values (MEBV) for persistency. The MEBV was calculated using the significant SNP effects in Table  and polygenic effect calculated using the pedigree information. There was a strong correlation (0.95) between the EBV and MEBV but considerable variation still remains unexplained. . For total milk yield the GeneRaVE tuning parameters were set at  = 10   = 0 and  0 = 2.75 after cross-validation. The last parameter reflects the different measurement scale for total milk yield in comparison to persistency. Fifty-two SNP were selected for total milk yield using GeneRaVE. Shifting these putative SNP effects to the fixed effects part of the model and including the pedigree ( = 47  843 compared to an average estimated error variance of 3 572) reduced the number of SNP to 18 (at the 0.10 level)  which are presented in Table . Figure  is a plot of the observed (using the spline model) and predicted (using the selected SNPs and the pedigree) total milk yields. The correspondence is very good and in fact much better than for persistency (a correlation of 0.996). A single outlier corresponds to a sire with a large weight (from stage 1) and hence lower information content. . In the association mapping study carried out here  we found SNP associations for persistency and milk yield that had previously been reported  as well some newly identified regions or genes that need further analysis. In the association analysis for persistency  two of the 18 SNP  found significant at the 0.05 significance level (Table ) are within known genes. There are 14 SNP that appear closely associated with known genes and two other SNP closely associated with hypothetical protein producing loci. One highly significant SNP was found on BTA4 (47.8 Mbp) in the gene CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor) involved in cystic fibrosis in humans. This gene functions as a small conductance chloride channel in epithelial membranes and its function in homeostasis and energy control makes it an ideal candidate gene for involvement in persistency []. On BTA15  the SNP appears to associate with the uncoupling protein 3  UCP3  a mitochondrial protein carrier thought to be related to metabolic traits and obesity []. Another gene detected in the association analysis of persistency is PAPD1  a polyA polymerase associated domain containing 1. It has been postulated that PAPD1 and UCP3 are involved with obesity and metabolism []. Obesity is known to effect lactogenesis []. Leptin  a protein hormone produced by adipocytes (fat cells) which has important effects in regulating body weight  metabolism and food intake  has been shown to inhibit hepatocyte growth factor-induced ductal morphogenesis of bovine mammary epithelial cells []. It is possible that PAPD1 and UCP3 genes have a similar effect  thereby affecting persistency. On BTA28  an SNP was significant at the 0.05 level for both persistency and milk yield analyses which suggests an association with the leucine-rich repeat  immunoglobin like and transmembrane domain 1  LRIT1  gene. This region has already been shown to be involved in milk production []. There are other significant SNP for persistency that may be associated with known or hypothetical genes and that may be causative  but these need further investigation. For the total milk yield  the 18 significant SNP are closely associated with known or predicted genes (table ). The SNP found on BTA1 point to regions already identified as having possible effects on milk yield []. This analysis  like the association analysis for persistency  found many SNP in or near genes involved in various functions such as protein binding  signal transduction  receptor binding and membrane stability. The SNP on BTA16 appears to be associated with a gene coding for ATPase  H+ transporting  lysosomal 13 kDa  V1 subunit G3(ATP6V1G3). The SNP on BTA23 and BTA14  respectively  are in regions already shown to have an impact on milk yield []. The significant SNP on BTA12  19 and 24 were in  or close to  genes with known function  but these genes have not previously been associated with milk yield and thus need further investigation. NCSS originally discussed in 1999 by White and colleagues [] was found very useful to model lactation curves. The methodology described in our paper continues the work of White and colleagues [] and Druet and colleagues [] and provides a flexible approach to model lactation curves. The advantage of such a representation is the ease with which important characteristics of the lactation curve such as time to peak  yield at peak  persistency and total milk yield can be determined. Not constraining the curves to have a particular parametric form is also an advantage because it is not necessary that all lactation curves follow the strict form that is implied by such functions. In our paper  we have extended the use of NCSS for the estimation of EBV of 383 sires for persistency of lactation and total milk yield  two important characteristics of the lactation curve. Sire EBV can be found for both traits allowing the ranking of sires and hence enabling selection and management decisions to be made in practice. NCSS can be used to easily model the sire influence of all the important features of the lactation curve. Importantly  persistency can be calculated using the estimated peak rather than a fixed day across all animals. However  this may not be possible to implement in the situation of a breeding association since the computational demands and the extreme number of records may be too great. The genome-wide association study found SNP associated with persistence of milk yield and total milk yield that were close to genes of known or postulated function  part of these confirming previous results. The inclusion of the polygenic effect in the analysis was crucial in establishing significant associations. It would be possible to repeat the association study with the genotyped animals using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 chip but it would be necessary to increase the number of genotyped animals to have sufficient power to identify significant QTL. Lastly  the use of 'sparse' selection tools [  ] is useful to reduce important SNP to an appropriate number. Despite the successful discovery of SNP related to milk persistence and total milk yield  the association mapping conducted here is largely exploratory and several issues still require further investigation. The first issue concerns additional fixed and random effects that are typically necessary in such an analysis. This is particularly important because pedigree information is often available and the association between genotypes is modelled using an additive relationship matrix through a random effect. Including such information can have a major impact on the association mapping  as shown here when the pedigree was included. The second issue relates to the status of the selected markers. As random effects  they will be shrunk towards zero  while if taken as fixed effects after selection  some bias is likely to occur. The degree of such bias is unknown. These issues are currently investigated by the authors and colleagues. Grossman M  Hartz SM  Koops WJ: Persistency of lactation yield: A novel approach. J Dairy Sci. 1999  82: 2192-2197.

It is also known that fertility of an individual changes over the laying period. Longitudinal models including both random genetic and permanent environmental effects of both the female and her male mate were used to model the proportion of fertile eggs in a pedigree broiler population over the ages 29-54 weeks. Both the male and the female contribute to variation in fertility. Estimates of heritability of weekly records were typically 7% for female and 10% for male contributions to fertility. Repeatability estimates ranged from 24 to 33%  respectively. The estimated genetic variance remained almost constant for both sexes over the laying period and the genetic correlations between different ages were close to 1.0. The permanent environment components increased substantially towards the end of the analyzed period  and correlations between permanent environment effects at different ages declined with increasing age difference The heritability of mean fertility over the whole laying period was estimated at 13% for females and 17% for males. A small positive correlation between genetic effects for male and female fertility was found. Opportunities to improve fertility in broiler stocks by selection on both sexes exist and should have an impact throughout the laying period. Fertility is a trait of major interest in the broiler industry  primarily because of its effect on chick output. Also  as there is a negative correlation between growth and fertility  especially in naturally mated flocks []  selection for growth alone over several generations is likely to result in a decline in fertility or in the ability of the males to mate efficiently [  ]. Therefore  balanced selection should be aimed at improving key life performance traits while maintaining reproductive potential. Fertility in poultry is traditionally regarded as an independent trait either of the male or the female  but genetic and non-genetic factors originating from both the male and female affect egg fertilization and embryo development []. Fertility of an individual egg is also a function of the genotype of the embryo  to which both parents contribute. Therefore  both paternal and maternal components should be accounted for simultaneously when analyzing fertility. Factors affecting fertility which originate from the male include several sperm quality traits such as sperm metabolism  semen concentration  sperm motility  and the percentage of abnormal or dead sperm cells []. Behavioral factors include the male's ability to successively mate with the hens efficiently  which may be affected by leg problems [] in the event of uncontrolled growth. Sperm quality traits are believed to be moderately heritable []  whereas behavioral traits usually have a low heritability []. Factors originating from the female include egg quality  and behavioral and physiological factors such as prevalence of sperm storage tubules (SSTs) []. The issue of what is responsible for the decline in late fertility between sexes was recently addressed from a biological perspective by Barna []. In several studies  age has been shown to have a significant effect on fertility of broiler breeders [–]. Fertility generally declines after a peak [] while the effect of age on female breeders is more significant than on male breeders [  ]. The practice in a typical broiler breeding programme is to selectively improve traits within specialized male and female pure lines. To produce a commercial broiler  the aim is to enhance male fertility in a male line and female fertility in a female line with appropriate levels of selection pressure  but both components are important in line multiplication and in increasing selection intensity in nucleus populations. The traits of interest are the level of fertility and the ability to maintain high fertility over a long period  indicated by persistency. It is therefore highly desirable to provide an analysis of fertility which uses all available data to simultaneously estimate breeding values for male and female fertility. An analysis should account for all sources of variation  including the genetic and the permanent non-genetic environmental effects of the hen and her mate  and the effect of age and temporary environmental effects specific to each laying and hatching period. Several approaches to analyze aspects of fertility in poultry can be found in the literature but none are all inclusive. For example  models used in recent analyses include fitting direct and maternal genetic effects for female fertility []  fitting the trait as one of the females but also including male fertility in the model as a random non-genetic effect [  ]  which ignores the genetic contribution from the males  and longitudinal models including changes of fertility over time [] based either on male or female fertility separately. Some have used likelihood or Bayesian approaches taking into account the binary nature of the trait []  and one example of the desired model  which fits male and female components simultaneously  has been applied to time of lay in wild birds []. The different potential inputs into fertility  including sire  dam and offspring genotypes over a protracted period of life  provide questions about the genetic control of the trait which may have implications to other life history characters. Hence the present study was undertaken to investigate the various contributions to fertility by estimating genetic parameters for female and male fertility simultaneously using an animal model  taking into account the longitudinal nature of the trait by using random regression models. Fertility data from a fully pedigreed pure broiler line were obtained from Aviagen Ltd  a primary broiler breeding company in the UK. The data comprised records of 555 males mated to 3755 females over a period of five years. Birds were housed in floor pens at a ratio of one male to ten females of the same age. The hens were trap nested with eggs set for incubation every week. Eggs were candled on the 7 day of incubation to record the number of infertile (candled clear) eggs. Fertility was defined as the proportion of the total number of eggs set in each laying period that were fertile (as determined by candling). For the male  the total number of eggs set was the sum of all settable eggs laid by all the hens in the pen within the given period  while for the female  number of eggs set related only to the total number of settable eggs laid by the individual female within the period. Males were usually replaced if weekly fertility in a pen was consistently low for a period of five weeks. Data from such males were excluded from the analysis. The time trajectory used in this analysis was the age of the hen when the eggs were hatched. Records from ages 29 to 54 weeks were included  and comprised a total of 66104 weekly fertility records derived from a total of 342797 eggs set. The mean number of eggs set was 5.19 and  of the 66104 records  only 1557 were based on one egg. In the main analysis all weekly fertility records were used without weighting by the number of eggs set. The average weekly fertility across hens and over age is shown in Figure . . All analyses were undertaken using ASREML []  which permits fitting a sire-dam model with both components linked to the pedigree. Fertility was described by the following random regression model using Legendre polynomials as covariates: where: is a fertility record  i.e. the proportion of eggs set that were fertile  for incubation at the -th week of age by female  mated to male  in POU   is a fixed effect of contemporary group (which incorporates genetic trend)  is the -th fixed regression coefficient  and are the -th random regression coefficients for the additive genetic effect of  respectively  male  and female  mated to male   and are the corresponding coefficients for permanent environmental (PE) effects  is the value of -th degree Legendre polynomial at week   is a random residual effect   to  are degrees of covariates fitted to fixed  genetic  and permanent environment effects  where  = 0 denotes a constant term and  = 1 a linear regression coefficient etc. Since the use of random regression models fitting hen and mate genetic and permanent environment effects simultaneously for fertility of eggs is novel  it was necessary to consider a large array of models to determine which was the most plausible and provided an adequate description of the data. A subset of the many models fitted and corresponding likelihoods is shown in Table . In the analyses presented  a cubic polynomial ( = 3) was used to model the fixed effect of age on fertility  as this described the observed mean weekly fertility profile (Figure ). Increasing degrees of polynomials were tested to model the random permanent environment and genetic terms  and assessed by changes in the log likelihood. The likelihood increased substantially with increasing degree of polynomials fitted to the PE effects (shown up to cubic in Table )  without reaching an apparent asymptote at quartic regressions. This corresponds with findings from other studies which suggest that increasing the order of fit for the random PE effects will continually increase the likelihood [] (K. Meyer  personal communication). We considered a cubic regression to be a reasonable stopping point  after which the general shape of the relations of variances with weeks did not change qualitatively. The residual variance  Var()  was assumed to be different for each week of the age trajectory as fitting homogenous residuals over the whole or for three separate time segments gave much lower likelihoods  and we had no prior knowledge of the pattern of the error variances. In order to estimate the genetic correlation of male and female effects on fertility  a covariance between male and female genetic effects was also fitted in some models. This refinement was restricted to models with constant genetic effects ( =  = 0) in part because these models described the data almost as well as those of higher degree (see later)  and in part because the simple models allow interpretation in terms of a single genetic correlation. An unweighted analysis was used  but just simply weighting of weekly observations by the number of eggs set would not have been adequate because there was a high variance between parents in fertility. To accommodate both variation in numbers set per week and real differences between families  an analysis using a threshold model  which is much more computationally demanding  was undertaken fitting sire and dam genetic effects as constant ( =  = 0) and linear random regression PE terms ( =  = 1). However  it was not pursued further  because the relative size of all the genetic and PE components was found to be essentially the same as in the corresponding analysis using the unweighted model (data not shown). The weekly proportion of fertile eggs was modelled as a trait of the hen which laid the eggs and of her mate  with both birds contributing genetic effects (structured proportional to the additive relationship matrix) and non-genetic individual specific (permanent environment  PE) effects. Variances of the random effects (genetic and PE) of both male and female on fertility were significantly greater than zero. Variances due to non-genetic permanent environment effects of males (across mates and over time) and females (across time) were large and much higher than the corresponding genetic effects at all ages (Figures  and ). These variance components increased non-linearly with age  with the male PE variance being higher than that of females. The difference between the magnitudes of the PE variances in Figures  (linear) and 3 (cubic) illustrate both that the variance contributed by PE effects  particularly of males  increases with age  but that the effects are less extreme than a linear regression would indicate. The increase in likelihood was small (approximately 5 for an extra 4 df) when the male and female genetic effects were modelled with a linear regression on weeks rather than a constant for each (Table ) with almost all the increase due to females. Higher order genetic regressions were consequently not considered. Except where noted  the following results use a model with linear genetic and cubic PE terms. . af = additive genetic effect of female  am = additive genetic effect of male  pef = permanent environmental effect of female  pem = permanent environmental effect of male  e = residual effect  with variance assumed heterogeneous over weeks . af = additive genetic effect of female  am = additive genetic effect of male  pef = permanent environmental effect of female  pem = permanent environmental effect of male  e = residual effect  with variance assumed heterogeneous over weeks The heritability for both male and female effects is plotted as a function of weeks in Figure . It was generally higher for males than for females  and did not change greatly with age  ranging from 7% to 9% for females and from 7% to 11% for males with the peak after a few weeks of laying. . h2m = heritability of male fertility  h2 f = heritability of female fertility Random regression analysis enables estimation of correlations between any pairs of age points. Examples of estimated genetic correlations and correlations of permanent environment effects for an early  mid and late week of production are given in Tables  and   respectively  in each case for both dams and sires. The genetic correlations for males are essentially one  and those for females exceed 0.7  even for the ages furthest apart (beginning and end of recording). This suggests that there is essentially no genetic variation in persistency of males and only a limited amount in females. The correlations of PE effects are much smaller  with a similar pattern in the two sexes  50-80% for the more adjacent periods and nearer 20% for those furthest apart. These results indicate  in line with the graphs showing variances (Figure ) that individual fertility changes substantially with age; indeed some birds become infertile. The inclusion of a genetic covariance between male and female genetic effects (fitted as constants) in the model did not result in a significant increase in the log likelihoods (Table ). The estimate of the genetic correlation  0.15  was consequently small  but was positive. The present study shows clearly that both the female and her male mate influence the fertility of the egg  and that the contribution of each sex is influenced by both genetic and permanent environment components. Therefore  the male contribution is important  not only because each male is mated to many females but because  in a sire line  the individual male and his male descendents have a major influence on the efficiency of the multiplication pyramid. Furthermore  while the results pertain directly to domesticated poultry  there is no reason to doubt that there will be contributions of both sexes to egg fertility in natural populations of birds. However  obtaining adequate data to support or refute this conjecture in the wild would be difficult. The conclusions are  of course  dependent to some extent on the model which is used for the analysis. We have not  for example  included maternal genetic effects because we considered it is more important to include the male genetic and permanent environment components when analyzing the trait as  essentially  one of the direct effects of the male and female mates  both of which had a large influence. With what are basically binary data  alternative analyses to cater for the heterogeneity in variance can be undertaken. For example a threshold model has been fitted in Bayesian analyses to data on fertility and other egg production traits in egg laying stock  but with the trait analysed solely as one of the female [  ]. However  the permanent environment contribution of both sexes is large  such that the contribution from the binary variance taken over periods of weeks is relatively small  and also the change in the mean and thus phenotypic variance over ages is not great (Figure ). We also fitted heterogeneous residual variances over the laying period to allow for any changes. Thus we consider that the analysis undertaken on the simple weekly proportion of eggs that were fertile  which is the trait definition use in the industry where hatching and selection occurs weekly  without weighting by numbers or scaling for the binary data is adequate and most relevant. Even so it may be worthwhile in future analyses to consider weighting by egg number or using longer time periods  or pursuing more complex analytical methods. The random regression analysis appeared to show inflated values of the permanent environment terms towards the extremes of the laying period  particularly when fitting a linear regression for PE terms. Such a result is often considered a typical feature of the random regression model [  ]; but it is most likely an indication that all sources of variation have not been adequately modelled  as indicated by changes when error variances were fitted with varying level of complexity [  ]. It may also be due to the sparsity of records available at the extremes of the age trajectory  resulting in less information available to estimate the variances. Fitting higher order regressions reduced this extreme behaviour by more accurately partitioning total variance to all components. The fertility in this line reached a peak  remained at a high level for some weeks and then slowly declined (Figure ). Various factors can influence the decline in fertility with age  including yield of spermatozoa [] and plasma composition [] of the male and the efficiency of sperm storage of the female []. Although early studies have indicated that in most cases males are responsible for completely infertile matings and that replacing them leads to fertility in over 90% of matings []  more recently the role of females in persistency of fertility has been stressed [  ]. Fertility in females has been found to be more susceptible to the influence of age than that of males [  ]. Our study shows that the genetic correlation between fertility at different ages for both males and females was very high across ages and was close to one for the male component (Table ). The contributions from permanent environment effects in both sexes increased with age  particularly for males (Figures  and ) and were much larger than those from the genetic effects  but the correlations across ages were much lower. This pattern agrees with a finding that males having a poor sperm quality index at a young age have a low sperm quality subsequently and a large decline in fertility after the peak []. The heritability of fertility estimated in this study was low at all ages. This is not surprising as it is a fitness related trait. Both male and female components increased initially to a peak  at about 9% for the female and 11% for the male  and then declined with age (Figure ). For comparison with other reports  heritability was also estimated using a repeatability model in which the genetic and permanent environmental variances were assumed to be constant over ages. With this model the estimates of heritability for one week's set of eggs averaged over the laying period were 7% for females and 10% for males and those for repeatability were 24% and 33%  respectively. The magnitude of these estimates falls within the range found in the literature for female fertility. For example  Sapp et al. [] analysed female fertility with a repeatability model and reported heritability estimates ranging from 5.5% to 7.4% depending on the way in which missing values were treated. Similar estimates were obtained for liability of fertility ( = 6.7%; repeatability = 22%) using a threshold Bayesian model []. Higher heritability and accuracy of selection may be obtained by averaging fertility over several weeks of set  either by pooling over eggs or by averaging weekly fertilities. However  in view of the high PE variances  the increase in heritability is not great. For the simple average of weekly fertility records  we predict it would reach 13% for females and 17% for males. Presumably  if all records were pooled with appropriate weightings and corrections for week of laying effect  somewhat higher values would be predicted. The genetic correlation between ages was high for both sexes  particularly males  which indicates that early records of fertility can be used to make breeding decisions and that there are limited opportunities to specifically improve fertility in older flocks  which is when production is most limited. Even so  basing selection decision on records from the early stages alone  gives no emphasis to the important issue of persistent fertility as the flock ages. The genetic correlation between male and female fertility used here refers essentially to the correlation between the fertility of eggs produced by daughters and by the mates of sons. The correlation was positive in our study but moderate and non-significant (0.15)  indicating that improvement of one sex would be slightly beneficial  and certainly not harmful to the other  but that selection on records of both sexes would be needed for maximum improvement of overall flock performance. This could also be achieved by fitting a sire-dam multivariate BLUP model using cumulative records during the laying period from which breeding values for fertility of both sexes can be obtained for each candidate for selection. Several interesting questions remain for future research. One question is the magnitude of the genetic variance of hatchability after candling at 7 days  and its correlation with (pre-candling) fertility. Another one is the correlation between fertility and performance traits such as growth rate  although the analysis is not straightforward as only selected birds have the opportunity to breed. This also implies that  if the correlations are high  there may be biases in the current estimates of genetic variances and heritability as the data have  in effect  been censored. As this study shows  such analyses have to cater jointly for effects of both sexes and  for the reproduction traits  incorporate both genetic and permanent environment effects.

The most significant QTL identified on chromosome 6 for  may be the target for future fine-mapping research efforts. For ruminants reared on grazing systems  gastrointestinal nematode parasite infections represent the class of diseases with the greatest impact on animal health and productivity []. Due to the growing incidence of anthelmintic resistance among most parasite species  there is a need for a sustainable control of gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) parasites. Among the potential strategies  enhancement of host resistance through the selection of resistant animals has been suggested by many researchers. Because of the difficulty of routine collection of phenotypic indicators of parasite resistance  information based on molecular markers can be used to improve the efficiency of classical genetic breeding. Most studies on the detection of QTL for parasite resistance in sheep have been carried out in sheep populations specialised for meat and/or wool production [  ]  and particularly in young animals [–]. However  the variety of sheep breeds and nematode species considered in these studies has resulted in little consensus among the results reported. In the present study  we carried out a genome scan based on a daughter design in a commercial population of Spanish Churra sheep  an indigenous dairy breed from the region of Castilla y León where the traditional breeding system is based on autochthonous grazing breeds. Even when gastrointestinal parasite infections in Churra sheep are moderate   nematode parasites are known to cause substantial production losses in the Churra flocks due to subclinical infection and reduction of the general immune response []. In addition  the infection of young replacement females turned out to pasture for the first time may lead to clinical signs of disease such as diarrhoea and even death in some cases []. Previously  we quantified the proportion of the phenotypic variation of four parasite resistance traits that are under genetic control []. The occurrence of heritable variation has been observed for the four parasite traits studied  which suggests that genetic improvement is possible for these traits. However  the low heritability estimates obtained for the studied indicators of parasite resistance (ranging from 0.09 to 0.21)  together with the difficulty of routinely collecting these phenotypes  suggests that the use of marker assisted selection might be of special interest for enhancing the response to selection of these traits. Based on this  and taking advantage of the genotypic information generated in a previous genome screening program undertaken in Churra sheep  we performed an initial QTL scan for four parasite traits measured in eight half-sib families of the Selection Nucleus of ANCHE (National Association of Spanish Churra sheep Breeders). The experimental design used in the present study is the daughter design described by Soller and Genizi []. We analysed a total of 322 ewes belonging to eight half-sib families  with an average family size of 40.25 daughters per sire (range: 19-84). Samples from these animals were collected from seven flocks included in the Selection Nucleus of ANCHE (National Association of Spanish Churra sheep Breeders). As indicators of parasite resistance following natural infection  we used the phenotypes studied by Gutiérrez-Gil et al. [] for the estimation of genetic parameters of parasite resistance traits in a larger population of Churra sheep (928 ewes). From the 928 animals sampled for parasite resistance traits  those animals belonging to half-family groups with at least about 20 ewes were selected for the present QTL detection experiment  avoiding the analysis of very small families. Hence a total of 322 animals were included in the genome scan analysis reported here. The methodology and techniques used to determine these phenotypes have been described in detail by Gutiérrez-Gil et al. []. Below is a brief description of the four phenotypes analysed  followed by a brief comment on the aspect of parasite resistance to which each trait is related: : Faecal egg count per gram (epg) at day 0 of the experiment  when all sampled animals received anthelmintic treatment. A modified McMaster technique was used to determine faecal egg counts. After the anthelmintic treatment the animals were exposed to natural infection in the fields following the normal management used by Churra sheep breeders. After a period of about 60 days  the following three measures were performed. : Faecal egg count per gram (epg) at approximately day 60 after beginning the experiment. A modified McMaster technique was used to determine faecal egg counts. : The IgA () levels against a somatic extract of the fourth stage larvae (LIV) from  were measured using an ELISA test based on the technique described by Martínez-Valladares et al. [].  The concentration of serum pepsinogen  as measured by fluorometric determination in a 96-well microtitre plate using a technique adapted from Edwards et al. []. The number of eggs per gram of faeces (epg) is a measure of eggs produced by adult female parasites within the host animal and is thought to be a good indicator of the parasite infection status of the host []. In addition  the serum anti- LIV level () is an indicator of a specific immune reaction to the fourth stage larvae of   the most important parasite in Churra sheep. The serum pepsinogen level is an indicator of gastric damage associated with the progression of larvae to adult stages []. In Churra sheep  the increase in serum pepsinogen has been found to be triggered by the action of the LIV and early non-egg-laying adults []. Hence  the traits studied are likely to represent different aspects related to the host-parasite interaction during infection. Age of the animals was sorted in six different levels according to the lambing number (from 1 to 5 years  and 6 or more than 6)  and their physiological status varied among four different states (dairy  pregnant  dry-not pregnant or )  as we have previously reported []. Basic statistics for the four measured traits are given in Additional File . Regarding the faecal egg count  the most prevalent genera encountered was  (65.5%)  followed by  spp. (30.5%)   spp. (3.1%) and some less frequent genera (1%  spp. and  spp.). Prior to further analysis  the distribution values for  and   which were positively skewed  were transformed using a logarithmic transformation [ = ln (+1);  = ln (+1)].  and  did not require any transformation. The influence of fixed factors and the estimation of genetic parameters for the studied traits have been reported elsewhere []. A total of 322 ewes from the complete set of animals sampled for parasite resistance traits (928 ewes) were included in a genome scan analysis carried out in Churra sheep to detect QTL for dairy traits [–]. Taking advantage of the genotypic information generated in that genome scan and the linkage maps built for the Churra sheep population  we performed a QTL analysis for the four traits related to parasite resistance considered in this experiment. In this genome scan a total of 182 markers (181 microsatellites and 1 SNP) distributed along the 26 ovine autosomes were genotyped across 1 421 animals belonging to 11 half-sib families. The procedures used for the genotyping of the 182 markers have been described in detail elsewhere [  ]. The linkage map used in the current work was that generated for the most complete Churra sheep population genotyped (1.421 ewes)  which has been reported by Gutiérrez-Gil et al. []. This map  which was built with the CRI-MAP 2.4 software []  showed an average marker interval of 17.86 cM [] and an information content (IC) for QTL detection of about 0.6 []. The use of this map for the parasite resistance genome scan allowed a more accurate estimation of the phase of the paternal sires  yielding therefore more reliable QTL results. Mapping of quantitative trait loci was performed by the multimarker regression method described by Knott et al. [] for half-sib designs implemented with the HSQM software []. Response variables used in the QTL analysis were the Yield Deviations (YD) []  which are the records expressed as deviations from the population mean and corrected for the corresponding environmental effects. For each trait  the effects included in the YD calculation were those considered in the estimation of the genetic parameters  which had been shown to have a significant influence on the trait (Flock-Year-Season (5 levels)  Lambing Number or age (6 levels)  and Permanent Environmental effects for the four traits; the sampling interval was also considered for ). When evidence for a significant effect was found in the across-family analysis  the position with the greatest F-value was considered as the most likely location of the QTL  and the within-family analysis was examined to identify the segregating families and to estimate the QTL size effect. Chromosome-wise significance thresholds were obtained for each trait-chromosome combination by performing 10 000 random permutations of the phenotypic data []. QTL effects were considered significant if they exceeded the 5% chromosome-wise significance threshold (p-value < 0.05). Genome-wide p-values were obtained by applying the following Bonferroni correction:   where  indicates the contribution of the chromosome to the total genome length []. The  parameter was calculated based on the last update of the Australian sheep linkage map [] (consulted September 2008). The results of the within-family analyses were used to identify the families segregating for each of the QTL identified at the whole population level (those with a within-family p < 0.05  as determined through permutation testing). Correction for multiple traits was not performed due to the preliminary nature of the genome scan so that we could compare our results with other studies []. Empirical 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by the bootstrapping method []. The regression analysis revealed five significant QTL at the 5% chromosome-wise level on chromosomes 1  6  10 and 14  and the QTL on chromosome 6 exceeded the 5% genome-wise significance level. Details regarding the QTL position  significance level and 95% CI calculated for all the QTL identified by the across-family regression analysis are given in Table   along with the position and estimated effect for each of the segregating families identified in the within-family analysis. Significant QTL were found for three out of the four traits investigated. Four of the significant linkage associations identified influenced the faecal egg count  and one chromosomal region was associated with the  serum indicator. No QTL were observed for . The statistical profiles for the four parasite resistance traits obtained along the four chromosomes where the significant QTL were detected are represented in Figures  and . .

[] for details about marker names and genetic distances. The most significant QTL was located on the second half of chromosome 6  within the marker interval   and influenced  (Figure ). This QTL reached genome-wise significance (p = 0.041) and was found to segregate in three out of the eight analysed half-sib groups (Families 1  2 and 7). For Family 1  which showed the highest significance level  the QTL position suggested by the within-family analysis was coincident with the results of the across-family analysis. For the two other segregating families  the QTL were localised within the first and second downstream marker intervals with regard to the QTL across-family position. Here  it should be noted that the estimation of the across-family QTL position may be biased towards the marker with the highest informativeness in the region  microsatellite marker   for which all the sires included in the study were heterozygous. This discrepancy regarding the within-family QTL positions may explain the large 95% CI obtained for this QTL  which spanned 91 cM of the chromosome length. However  the possibility that the effect detected at the across-family level can be due to different QTL segregating in the different families can not be ruled out. The magnitude of the allelic substitution effect for this QTL in the segregating families ranged from 0.83 (Family 2) to 1.63 (Family 1) phenotypic SD units (Table ). On chromosome 1  a QTL associated with  was also found at the 5% chromosome-wise significance level. This QTL was found in the central region of the chromosome (152 cM). Close to the proximal end of the same chromosome  there was evidence for an additional 5% chromosome-wise significant QTL influencing . The other two significant QTL identified by the across-family analysis were found on chromosomes 10 and 14 and showed effects on . The QTL on chromosome 10 was located approximately in the middle of the chromosome  whereas the QTL on chromosome 14 was found at the proximal end  close to the first marker analysed on this chromosome. For each of the QTL identified at the 5% chromosome-wise level  only one family within the population was found to be segregating. The exception to this was the QTL identified on chromosome 14  where the within-family analysis indicates that two of the eight sires are likely to be heterozygous for this QTL (Families 1 and 6). The QTL position suggested by the within-family analysis for these two families was coincident with that estimated in the across-family analysis. The magnitude of the estimated allelic substitution effects for the QTL identified at the 5% chromosome-wise level ranged from 0.83 (chromosome 6 QTL for   Family 2) to 2.53 (chromosome 10 QTL for   Family 7) phenotypic SD units. Via a genome scan analysis  this study  based on the daughter design described by Soller and Genizi []  has identified five QTL influencing parasite resistance traits on four sheep autosomes. Considering that two independent traits were analysed (according to a principal component analysis performed with the SAS package []; results not shown)  the numbers of tests in our experiment expected by chance alone to be significant at the 5% genome-wise and chromosome-wise level are 0.13 and 2.6  respectively. We identified one and four significant associations in our across-family analysis for these respective significance levels  providing evidence in favour of genuine segregating QTL for parasite resistance traits in the studied population of Churra sheep. By adapting the method proposed by Weller et al. [] to our experimental conditions (e.g.  the number of ewes and families analysed  marker density and marker informativeness)  we estimated that the power of this experiment to detect a QTL with two alleles that occur with equal frequency and influence a trait with a heritability of 0.20 varied between 16% (0.3 phenotypic SD units) and 42% (0.5 phenotypic SD units) according to the magnitude of the allelic substitution effect that we considered. This estimation was performed assuming a type I error rate of 0.05 and 10% recombination between a marker and the QTL. Hence  we should take into account the fact that the low number of animals analysed in the regression analysis had an important negative influence on the statistical power of the experiment  and that a substantial proportion of genuine segregating QTL  especially those with small effects  may not have been identified by the across-family regression analysis performed. Therefore  we suggest that some of the other regions that were identified at a lower significance level in the across-family analysis might represent genuine QTL segregating in individual families. Some of these weak associations  e.g.  QTL identified at the 10% chromosome-wise significance level for  on chromosomes 1  2 and 24   on chromosomes 9 and 13  and  on chromosome 26 (data not shown)  might be confirmed if additional animals were to be included in the analyses. The lack of coincidence among the QTL identified for the different traits analysed here supports our previously mentioned hypothesis that the traits studied may represent different aspects of the host-parasite interaction during infection. It is possible that the QTL detected for  and  could be related to the early response to incoming larvae (i.e.  hypersensitivity reactions)  whereas the QTL for faecal egg counts may be associated with the ability to avoid the development of adult parasites. This agrees with the observations reported by Davies et al. []  who did not find any coincident QTL between parasitic traits and IgA activity. The lack of coincidence between the QTL influencing  and   although intriguing  agrees with certain differences observed regarding the correlations between these two traits and the serum indicator traits []. As suggested in that work  this could be related to the limited sample period between the faecal egg counts  which could indicate that  is a better indicator of the initial immune response triggered by larvae at the beginning of infection. On the other hand  the allelic substitution effects estimated for the QTL reported herein are likely to be overestimated as a result of the low power of the experiment at the sire-marker level. As shown by Lynch and Walsh []  the lower the power  the more the effects of a detected QTL are overestimated. Hence  the genuine QTL effects are likely to be much smaller. This result would be in accordance with the work of Houle et al. []  who suggested that parasite resistance is likely to be controlled by several loci and  therefore  may receive a strong mutation input  which generates genetic variation. This agrees with the complexity of the physiological processes that lead to nematode resistance []. In order to compare our QTL analysis results with chromosomal regions previously identified in sheep in relation to parasite resistance traits  we consulted the Sheep Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) database [] and other reports available in the literature. We found that some previously published QTL are coincident with the results reported herein. It is worth noting  however  that most of the QTL mapping studies targeting parasite resistance traits in sheep have typically used experimentally challenged animals  and that the parasite species considered vary between studies. In addition  most of the previously reported studies consider parasite resistance traits measured in young animals  mainly meat production lambs. Marshall et al. [] recently reported a QTL on chromosome 1 for  faecal egg count in 13-month-old Australian sheep. This QTL is close to the marker   which maps within the flanking interval of the chromosome 1 QTL reported here for . At the proximal end of the same chromosome  within the marker interval   Díez-Tascón et al. [] reported a within-family QTL for faecal strongyle egg count and an across-family significant QTL for adult  recovered from the gastric contents of outcrossed lambs at slaughter. These significant associations co-localise with the position of the chromosome 1 QTL influencing  that was identified in Churra sheep in our analysis. On chromosome 6  Beh et al. [] reported a genome-wise significant QTL for faecal  egg count in lambs after primary challenge. This QTL was confirmed to have a chromosome-wise significance following a secondary challenge and mapped to the interval between markers  and . According to the latest version of the Australian Sheep Linkage Map (v 4.7) []  the first of these two markers is 16 cM distal to  (male map)  one of the markers flanking the genome-wise significant QTL identified by our across-family regression analysis. On chromosome 14  Davies et al. [] reported three QTL related to  egg count in Scottish blackface lambs that were located in the last third of the chromosome  whereas the QTL for  that we identified mapped to the centromeric end of chromosome 14. Considering the low resolution of the preliminary genome scans that have been reported thus far regarding QTL position  some of these coincidences might indicate common underlying loci affecting parasite resistance traits. However  this possibility should be confirmed with further studies. Taking into account the high degree of variation between different experiments due to factors such as the type of parasite exposure (natural or artificial challenge)  the parasite species  the phenotypic indicators and the breeds of sheep studied  the identification of non-coincident QTL in different experiments may suggest the existence of complex host-parasite relationships that have unique features that depend on the host-parasite combination. Curiously  our analysis did not find any significant association within two of the regions for which consensus has been found in different studies. These are the regions close to  on chromosome 3 [  ] and the histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 20 [    ]. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the studies that found significant associations in these two regions were focused on lambs  whereas our study considered adult ewes. Marshall et al. [] reported an important age and/or immune status specificity of the QTL for resistance to  that they identified in Australian sheep. This specificity is based on the low overlapping levels observed for the QTL that influenced the faecal egg counts measured in animals 6 and 13 months of age. This kind of age-specific mode of action could apply to most parasite infections  which would provide support at the genetic level for the hypothesis suggested by Stear et al. [] that describes the different mechanisms controlling GIN parasite infections in lambs (antibody response) and adult sheep (hypersensitivity reaction). Also  Balic et al. [] suggested that the genes that control key mechanisms preventing the establishment of worms in primary infections are different from those involved in subsequent infections. This idea is based on the different pathways that are involved in innate and acquired resistance. However  this hypothesis is challenged by the fact that overall immunity has been successfully achieved through selection for acquired resistance rather than via resistance to primary exposure to worms []. All these observations highlight the complexity of parasite resistance and the difficulty of completely understanding the genetic architecture of the physiological mechanisms underlying resistance as well as resilience. As mentioned by Dominik []  consistency in protocols  experimental materials and analysis approaches would facilitate the generation of phenotypic information that would help to increase our knowledge on this topic. In conclusion  we present evidence for a significant number of QTL that influence parasite resistance indicator traits in adult dairy sheep. Some of these linkage associations appear to confirm and support the presence of previously published QTL for parasite resistance in lambs  which could indicate that common genes underlie these traits throughout an animal's life. This study represents a starting point for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of parasite resistance in Churra dairy sheep. Further fine-mapping research efforts focused on the most promising regions  e.g.  the genome-wise significant QTL identified on chromosome 6  might be simplified as sheep SNP chips become affordable.

Sheep represent an economically important agricultural resource in the global meat  fibre  and milk production systems of both the developed and developing world. The multi-purpose nature of many sheep breeds and the highly specialised single purpose breeds  demonstrate the versatility and suitability of sheep production in a diverse set of production systems []. Sheep milk production represents a specialised commodity which has been developed across many breeding systems in either dual purpose  synthetic composite lines  or specialised dairy breeds such as the Awassi  Chios  Comisana  Lacaune  Laxta and Sarda Breeds []. Genetic variation has been reported for most of the major milk traits  and has been successfully exploited in genetic improvement programmes for sheep dairy production [–]. Over the past few decades  numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies have been conducted on many breeds of livestock to enrich our knowledge on the underlying biology and genetic architecture of complex traits. A general review of QTL mapping can be found in Weller []. However for milk production and udder health  fewer QTL studies have been conducted [  –] in dairy sheep in comparison with cattle  as reviewed by Khatkar et al. [] and summarised on the animal genome website []. Analysis of QTL information from diverse sources within a species provides important information on the consistency and utility of QTL across breeds  and is amenable to meta-analysis to reach a consensus on QTL location and effect []. Furthermore  cross-species comparative analyses with a species for which many QTL for the same traits have been reported such as milk traits in cattle may provide additional insight to QTL in a closely related species. This may give insight into ancestral genes for economically important traits and adds information to accelerate fine-mapping in the QTL information-sparse species. QTL mapping requires robust phenotypes. In the case of lactation measurements  the nature of these data is heterogeneous with respect to frequency  length and regularity of recording. One approach is to use model-based prediction to standardise lactation characteristics. The advantages are that the heterogeneity mentioned above as well as age  parity and other effects are taken into account by producing a standardised curve  further facilitating meaningful comparisons. Using model-based predictions rather than empirical data has also the advantage of minimising random variation while simultaneously summarising the lactation profile into biologically interpretable parameters []. Therefore these derived parameters are then useful for linkage studies since they describe lactation-wide or lifetime milk production. One of the first lactation models used in dairy cattle was developed by Brody et al. [] and is based on an exponential decay function. Further models were also proposed by Sikka []  Wood []  Cobby and Le Du []  and Cappio-Borlino et al. []. By contrast  modelling lactation curves in dairy sheep is far less common [–]  but it is expected that dairy cattle models can be applied to sheep lactations []. This study reports an appropriate model to describe the characteristics of the sheep lactation curve  provides additional information on QTL for milk traits in sheep  and provides a within and cross-species QTL analysis from publicly available information in sheep and cattle. As described by Raadsma et al. [] a resource population from crosses between the improved dairy type Awassi (A) and the apparel wool Merino (M) sheep was established to exploit the extreme differences between these two sheep types in a range of production characteristics. The improved Awassi sheep was developed in Israel and has been identified as an ideal breed for milk production [] and possesses fleece characteristics suitable for carpet wool  whilst the Merino sheep was originally developed for the production of high quality apparel wool and recently used for meat production [] but is a poor milk producer. The Merino breed [  ] with its low milk yield  and the Awassi breed with its medullated carpet-wool quality represent two extremes for these production traits. Further details on the development of the resource population can be found in Raadsma et al. []. For modelling the lactation curves  lactation data from different generations  AMM backcross (AMM)  AM_AMM double backcross (DBC) and intercross (INT) progeny ( = 622)  were used. In the QTL study reported here  only genotypic information from the 172 ewe G AMM progeny of the first F sire were available where a genome-wide scan was performed. The additional families will be used in future work to confirm QTL effects and to fine-map confirmed QTL in combination with high density SNP marker analysis. A genome-scan using 200 polymorphic microsatellite markers covering all 26 autosomes was conducted in 172 backcross ewes. The markers comprised 112 cattle () markers  73 sheep () markers  and 15 other Bovinae markers. The procedures for DNA extraction  genotyping and allele calling  are described in detail in the first paper of this series []. All markers used for this study were the same as those used in the first paper of the series  and were mapped to the previously described population specific framework map []. Milk yields were recorded from morning and afternoon milking from 1999 to 2007 (except from 2004 to 2006 when only one daily milking was conducted). These yields were recorded using a Tru-Flow meter (Tru Flow Industrial Pumps  Bathurst NSW Australia) in the first phase until 2001 and subsequently with SRC-Tru Test electronic meter (Tru-Test Pty Limited  Mentone VIC Australia). Recordings were made daily in the first phase of the study and subsequently three times per week in the latter phase of the experiment. Milk from morning and afternoon milking was sampled for composition analyses to determine protein (PP)  fat (FP)  and lactose (LP) percentage and somatic cell count (SCC) in cells/mL. The somatic cell score (SCS) was calculated as the natural logarithm of SCC. Samples were analysed by 'Dairy Express' Australia []. Amongst a selection of lactation curve models that have been proposed in the literature [–]  the Wood [] model was selected here because of its simplicity and flexibility to derive key parameters that can be used to describe specific characteristics of the lactation curve. From a cursory check it was not obvious that other models provided a better fit to the data. The Wood model is defined as follows: where () is the expected milk yield at time  expressed in litres/day;  represents the time in days after parturition;  is a scaling parameter related to total yield of lactation with  = ln(); parameter  is related to the rate of increase prior to the lactation peak; and  is a parameter related to the rate of increase after the lactation peak. From this model  the cumulative milk yield up to day  (e.g. 100 days) can be calculated numerically as where <U+03B3>(·) is the lower incomplete gamma function    and can be evaluated by its relation to the cumulative distribution function of a gamma distribution. To fit lactation curve models to multiple sheep simultaneously  the Wood model was fitted using a nonlinear mixed model by the  function in R using the methods documented in Pinheiro et al []. In this case the model fitted is: where is the milk yield at time  for sheep   and are the Wood model \"parameters\" for sheep ; and e the random error of sheep  at time . These sheep-specific \"parameters\" can each be written as = <U+03BA>+   = ß+ and = <U+03C7>+   where <U+03BA>  and <U+03C7>are the fixed effects and   and are random deviations from these fixed effect means  assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution  The non-zero covariance terms (s  s  s) have been included to allow for correlations amongst the \"parameters\"  as observed in initial exploratory analyses. Note that the choice of the parameterisation of the Wood model as (    ) rather than as (    ) was made based on the closer approximation of the resultant deviations to a multivariate normal distribution. Also  the choice to analyse the yield () as a nonlinear mixed model  rather than ln() as a linear mixed model was made on the basis of residual diagnostics. The output from this analysis was to produce model-based 100-day cumulative milk yields for each ewe-lactation  adjusted to a common set of fixed effects. Preliminary studies using information of these animals have shown that the 100-day lactation performance is highly correlated with the extended lactation (200 to 400 days)  whereas 50 and 80 day lactation performances were unreliable in predicting extended lactation performance (additional file ). Therefore  due to the differences in recording durations across individual ewe-lactations  we chose to use model-based 100 day cumulative yields to describe and standardise the lactation performance of all ewes. Values for PP  FP  LP  SCC and SCS were analysed by fitting a linear mixed model using the  function in R. As suggested by Barillet []  the useful yield describes the ability to process milk into cheese  and was calculated using the predicted protein and fat percentages from the mixed model where UP = FP + 1.85 PP []. The cumulative milk yield at day 100 (YCUM) for each animal was multiplied with the milk content (protein  fat  lactose) and somatic cell scores/counts  to calculate the cumulative milk content until day 100 (PYCUM  FYCUM  LYCUM  YSCC  and YSCS for protein  fat  lactose  somatic cell scores and somatic cell counts  respectively). QTL analyses were performed for all traits using two methods. Solutions were first obtained using the QTL-MLE procedure in R as described previously [  ]. To account for multiple testing and to minimise the number of false positive QTL  the method developed by Benjamini and Hochberg [] was used to calculate genome-wise ranked -values for each trait. For QTL-MLE  a LOD 1.75-2.0 was deemed suggestive  LOD 2-3 significant  and LOD greater than 3 highly significant. The second method used the regression analysis for half-sib design in the web-based program QTL Express []. For this method  QTL with chromosome-wide significance threshold ( < 0.05) were described as suggestive  chromosome-wide levels  < 0.01 as significant and experiment-wide levels ( < 0.05 and  < 0.01) as highly significant QTL. Thresholds for QTL-MLE and QTL Express were chosen according to the threshold criteria applied in the first paper of this series. A two-QTL model was also fitted to the data using the same program []. The QTL heritability was calculated as the proportion of the phenotypic variance accounted for by the QTL [1-(mean square of full model/mean square of reduced model)]. Based on a Type I error of 0.05  the design had a predicted power of 0.72 to detect QTL with 0.4 SD effect []. In addition  the observed power for QTL detected under the Haley-Knott regression method was calculated using the method described by Hu and Xu []. The power was calculated at two different significance thresholds namely   < 0.05 and  < 0.01. A meta-assembly of QTL identified in this study was conducted by collating all known QTL from public sources for matched traits. Due to fewer records in sheep  it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis as described for cattle by Khatkar et al. [] to obtain consensus on the number and positions of QTL by means of a formal statistical hypothesis-based testing procedure. In contrast  for a qualitative assessment  a meta-assembly was undertaken by standardising all QTL against the V4.7 sheep linkage map [  ]. For each QTL  we identified the markers closest to the likely point location and to the ends of the 95% confidence interval (CI) segment. When no point location is available we used the midpoint of the chromosome. These markers or co-located markers were found on the reference map. For each QTL we defined a weighting function which gives a score which is maximal (1.0) at the point location and follows a quadratic decline to 0.1 at the boundaries of the CI segment. For each trait we summed the scores of non-redundant QTL. QTL identified as being potential duplicates of the same QTL (. QTL identified in the same study within an identical marker interval by different methods) were defined as redundant reported QTL. The individual QTL locations and their scores  and meta-score profiles were loaded into the ReproGen gbrowse GFF database [] which can be browsed at . This browser includes hyperlinks to the detailed QTL information for each locus. In a similar way we constructed a bovine QTL meta-assembly using previously published estimates of cattle QTL as reviewed by Khatkar et al []. Bovine QTL were extracted from the ReproGen QTL database described by Khathar et al. []. For a comparative analysis of ovine and bovine QTL we first defined blocks of synteny by comparing the locations of markers in the ovine reference map with their positions in the bovine btau4.0 genome sequence assembly []. The syntenic blocks can be used to compare features across genomes. By this means QTL from our bovine meta-assembly were added to the ReproGen ovine QTL browser. Finally we combined the ovine and bovine meta-scores to give a two-species meta-score and this also was made available as a track in gbrowse. In total 1509 lactation records with more than 130 000 observations from 622 ewes were obtained across the experiment and the Wood lactation model was then fitted to these data. A range of one to five lactations was available for each ewe. In the present study  the ewes were either milked once or twice a day over the lactation  leading to a considerable difference of the shape of the lactation curves and total milk yields (Figure ). The total milk yields were standardised against birth type = 1 (singleton)  third parity  twice milking/day. The fixed effect of season was significant in all models. Days in milk  sire  genetic group  and parity were non significant effects for all traits analysed. Age of animal  birth type  year of milking  milk yield and milking frequency were significant for specific traits. The number of observations  mean  standard deviation and the range values of all traits recorded for the 172 genotyped backcross females on which the QTL analysis were performed  are presented in Table . The YCUM of the lactation ranged between 26.1 and 126.3 kg with an average of 73.3 kg. The PYCUM ranged between 1.46 and 6.81 kg (average 4.05 kg). For the FYCUM a mean of 4.86 kg was found with yields ranging between 1.7 and 8.12 kg and for LYCUM ranged between 0.93 and 4.49 kg (average 2.62 kg). The mean PP and FP was 5.54%  and 7.09% respectively  and mean LP was 3.56% with almost no variance for the latter. The SCS ranged between 3.87 and 7.40 (average 4.97)  and the SCC had an average of 396 cells. The useful yield content was between 15.3 and 19.25 (average 17.33). . Shown are the total milk yield in litres (L) at the lactation day (days in milk) for animals milked twice or once a day A total of 40 suggestive and significant QTL were detected across the two single QTL analyses methods and 12 traits. All 13 significant and 11 suggestive QTL detected by QTL-MLE (Table ) were also identified using QTL Express (additional file ). The genome locations of the significant QTL for the four yield traits (YCUM  PYCUM  FYCUM  and LYCUM) are shown in Figure   with OAR3 and OAR20 showing a significant QTL for all four traits. OAR2 showed suggestive QTL for YCUM and LYCUM. The genome-wide QTL plots for the four composition traits (PP  FP  LP and UP) are shown in Figure . OAR3 and OAR25 showed significant QTL for FP and UP whereas OAR7 harboured a significant QTL for PP. A remarkably flat QTL profile was observed for LP with no significant QTL detected across the genome. No significant and relatively few suggestive QTL were detected for SCC  SCS  YSCS and YSCC (Figure ) with the strongest support for QTL for SCS on OAR17 and for YSCS on OAR14 and 22. The detailed information of the locations  effect sizes and confidence intervals for the 24 QTL is shown in Table  for QTL-MLE. Allelic effects for the significant QTL ranged from -0.96 SD to 0.77 SD for QTL recorded by QTL-MLE. . Drawn are the genome-wide graphs for the single traits of the cumulative yields until day 100 for milk  protein  fat and lactose; chromosomes are separated by vertical lines and further the significance thresholds (LOD = 2 and LOD = 3) are shown in each graph . Drawn are the genome-wide graphs for the single milk contents traits for protein  fat and lactose and the useful yield; chromosomes are separated by vertical lines and further the significance thresholds (LOD = 2 and LOD = 3) are shown in each graph . Drawn are the genome-wide graphs for the single traits of the somatic cell count and score and the cumulative somatic cell count and score; chromosomes are separated by vertical lines and further the significance thresholds (LOD = 2 and LOD = 3) are shown in each graph Using the regression analysis two additional significant QTL (exceeding the 1% chromosome-wide significance level) were identified  both of them did not reach the significance threshold using QTL-MLE. An additional 16 suggestive QTL were identified on OAR1  2  5  6  11  13  14  17  20  22  23  24 and 26 (additional file ) for all 12 traits using QTL Express. The highest phenotypic variance explained by QTL using QTL Express was for FYCUM on OAR3 (10.7%). The other significant QTL explained between 5.6 and 8% of the phenotypic variance (additional file ). QTL detected under either method  showed large confidence intervals as determined by 1-LOD support intervals under QTL-MLE (Table ) or from bootstrap procedures under QTL Express (additional file ). Among the results  QTL within the same marker interval were identified for the yield traits including milk  protein  fat  lactose  and somatic cell score yield. The derived traits of protein yield  fat yield  lactose yield  somatic cell count and somatic cell score yield are strongly correlated with milk yield. Phenotypic correlations in the range of 0.94 to 1 were detected between the yield traits (Table ). This suggests that a general QTL for milk yield may affect the QTL for protein  fat  lactose yield and for total somatic cell score. Results for the two-QTL model conducted under QTL Express are presented in Table . Significant evidence for an additional QTL under a two-QTL model was found in three cases on OAR9 for UP  on OAR17 for SSC and on OAR26 for PP  with a difference of 112  40  and 56 cM between the two loci  respectively. The two loci on OAR9 (UP) and OAR17 (SCC) were in coupling phase  whereas the QTL on OAR26 (PP) were of equal size and in repulsion phase. In an additional seven cases  the analyses by QTL Express suggested a significant second QTL located within 4 cM of the first QTL  and in six of these cases (the exception being the QTL for LYCUM on OAR22) the QTL were in repulsion phase of opposite and almost equal effect on OAR5 (SCS)  OAR16 (YSCC) and OAR22 (FYCUM  LYCUM  PYCUM  YSCS). Furthermore  in none of these six cases  were QTL identified using the single QTL model. We suggest that the QTL identified using the two-QTL model in these cases maybe an artefact as the distance between the two loci is within one marker interval  and the QTL are of equal but opposite effect. Only the region identified using the two-QTL model for YCUM on OAR22 was in accordance with the locus identified using the single QTL model. In only three cases where a putative two-QTL model provided a better fit to the data than a single QTL model (UP on OAR9  SSC on OAR17  and PP on OAR26) were the intervals between QTL greater than the marker intervals  these chromosomes can therefore be considered as carrying two different linkage regions for the same trait (Table ). From the interval mapping analyses  the observed QTL were detected with an average realised power 0.64 for  < 0.05 and. 0.4 for  < 0.01  using the method as described by Hu and Xu []. The greatest power was identified for the QTL for LYCUM  PYCUM and FYCUM on OAR3 (0.64 - 0.87 for  < 0.01 and 0.83 - 0.96 for  < 0.05). The lowest power of the detected QTL was found for the traits related to somatic cell count on OAR5  11  17  22 and 23 (0.17 to 0.28 for  < 0.01 and 0.37 to 0.51 for  < 0.05). In order to compare the QTL detected in this experiment with QTL findings in the public domain  a meta-assembly was conducted for each trait as shown in Figure . Among all studies  QTL for milk yield were identified on OAR1  2  3  6  9  14  16  20  22  and 24. Eight chromosomes were identified harbouring QTL for protein yield and six for fat yield. Eleven chromosomes were identified harbouring QTL for protein percent  of which five (OAR1  5  6  7  and 26) were detected by at least two independent studies. QTL for fat percent were reported on seven chromosomes of which six (OAR1  3  8  9  20  and 25) were supported by at least two different studies. Limited QTL information has been reported for SCC and SCS. For lactose percent and useful yield this experiment represents the only published QTL. A detailed description of the QTL including peak QTL position and confidence interval (where available) from each study are shown in the public domain . The information from all public domain QTL was not sufficiently dense to undertake a formal meta-analysis as conducted by Khatkar et al []. The meta-assembly provides a starting point for future meta-analysis as additional QTL studies will become available. . Tracks available in the ReproGen ovine gbrowse website  showing the sheep genomic locations of QTL for milk yield  useful yield protein yield and content  fat yield and content  lactose yield and content  and somatic cell score/count for individual QTL from this study and previous publications The assembly of all milk QTL from the public domain is made available through an online browser where specific traits and all known QTL locations  are user selected. The browser allows within-trait and across-trait analysis of the information. An example for the main milk traits   fat protein and lactose yield  and milk composition traits  protein  fat and lactose percentages  is shown in Figure . In order to aggregate the QTL information  the integrated QTL scores for each trait are shown in Figure  by way of a single QTL score with decreasing likelihood of QTL information away from peak location  and expressed as a heat map. . Tracks available in the ReproGen ovine gbrowse website  showing the sheep genomic locations of aggregate QTL for the same traits as in Fig. 5; each aggregate QTL is shown as a heatmap in which meta-score is proportional to colour intensity In order to expand the information on significant QTL for lactation performance  the wealth of information derived from cattle studies was deemed to be suitable for a comparative genomic analysis. The results from all cattle QTL on lactation performance were compared by Oxford grid analyses to all known ovine lactation QTL as shown for the example of milk yield in Figure . Each grid permits a high resolution comparison on QTL identity  literature source and comparative position on either the bovine or ovine genome. From the comparative analysis  synteny was detected for QTL for milk yield across five chromosomes (BTA5-OAR3  BTA6-OAR6  BTA20-OAR16  BTA23-OAR20  and BTA26-OAR22). Similarly for protein and fat percent  seven syntenic regions were detected (BTA1-OAR1  BTA3-OAR1  BTA6-OAR6  BTA10-OAR7  BTA18-OAR14 for PP; and BTA14-OAR9  BTA28-OAR25 for FP). QTL in five comparative regions were also identified for somatic cell count/somatic cell score (BTA1-OAR1  BTA7-OAR5  BTA18-OAR14  BTA23-OAR20 and BTA26-OAR22). . Oxford Grid comparison of ovine and bovine genomes; syntenic regions are shown as thin diagonal lines; aggregated QTL meta-scores for milk yield are also shown with meta-score proportional to colour intensity: sheep (red  to right of syntenic diagonals) and cow (blue  to left of diagonals) This paper describes the lactation characteristics in a flock specifically designed for QTL mapping and reports on a number of important findings. Firstly it presents an appropriate model to describe lactation curve characteristics in sheep  secondly it confirms previously identified QTL on a population specific framework-map and identifies novel QTL for lactation  and finally it compares the location of all known QTL for lactation performance within sheep breeds and across sheep and cattle. The Wood model was shown to be appropriate to describe lactation curves which supports its earlier use in sheep [  –]. However this is the first study in which the derived parameters were used in a QTL analysis for sheep. The use of quadratic lactation curve models provided a better fit to the lactation curves in dairy sheep when the evaluation of the lactation data was started after lactation day 30  but failed to give reasonable predictions of total milk yield []. Many different factors could be included in the nonlinear mixed model to help predict milk production. Each fixed effect used here was a significant factor in determining the lactation curve of each sheep. Previous studies have shown that various factors such as nutrition  multiple births  parity and lambing season have significant effects on milk production and hence affect model parameters [      ]. The parameter estimates (  and ) obtained in this study (5.35  0.13 and 0.0032  respectively) cannot be directly compared with many other estimates from previous studies due to differences in measurement units. However  a study of lactation curves in dairy cows used the Wood [] model to determine values for   and using the same units as those used here []. The estimates of the parameters from their research were 3.01 ()  0.091 () and 0.0027 () suggesting a general similarity between the two species in lactation curve characteristics. The most sizeable difference between both species is the first part of the lactation curve  which shows an early almost instantaneous peak of lactation in sheep  but a delayed peak in dairy cattle. In fact the coefficients and were found to be highly correlated ( = 0.79) in sheep  suggesting that one of the parameters may be redundant in this study. The lactation phenotypes (protein  fat and lactose content and milk yield) derived from the parameters of the Wood model were similar to lactation data described by Gutierrez-Gil et al. and Theodorou et al [  ]. We found that the SCS was similar to that reported previously []. This shows that the application of the Wood model is a useful tool to describe the overall lactation performance. This study is the fifth whole genome-scan which reports on QTL for lactation performance in sheep. This study is unique in that the experimental population used two breeds with extreme lactation characteristics. Previous studies were conducted across a diverse panel of breeds including Sarda × Lacaune  Lacaune  Churra and Basco-Bearnaise  Lacaune and Manech families [        ]. Furthermore this study has anchored the QTL on a population-specific framework map therefore minimising ambiguity in the location of QTL  and used two approaches for QTL analyses  a maximum likelihood approach [  ] and the regression method []. The QTL meta-assembly is a useful tool to show the greater QTL map for lactation traits in sheep among diverse experiments. The data suggest the existence of some major regions for milk production (yield  fat  protein  lactose). It is highly likely that the component traits are all influenced by QTL effects of milk yield which is further evidenced by the strong positive correlations between them (Table ). For the milk components expressed as percentage traits  we report for the first time on useful yield % as defined by Barillet []. Since this trait is a weighted index of fat and protein percentage it describes the overall milk characteristics for cheese making. The QTL for this trait was also aligned to QTL for milk yield. No QTL were observed for lactose percent which may be consistent with the very low degree of phenotypic variation observed in our study which was in accordance with some but not all other studies [    ]. Although exact locations for QTL could not be compared given the generally very wide confidence intervals for such locations  the meta-assembly is useful in that a consensus location can be derived by combining QTL peak location and confidence intervals in a single score for multiple studies. This gives an aggregate profile of the most likely QTL location for traits with similar phenotype and background as shown in Figure . The meta-assembly can subsequently be used for a formal meta-analysis as undertaken by Khatkar et al. []  but in the absence of such an analysis the QTL score seems appropriate. From our analyses  the statistical method used to identify QTL showed a high degree of consistency for the major (significant QTL) so comparisons across independent studies should not be adversely affected by using different analytical methods. However  reporting on QTL with a marginal significance may be affected by analysis methods  and the use of a least squares regression method perhaps over representing putative QTL. Despite the total number of reports on QTL analyses for lactation traits in sheep  most are derived from four populations and publications on fragments of the data (partial genome scans) do not add new information for meta-analyses over the genome-wide analyses [        ]. Despite the breed diversity used in QTL mapping of lactation traits the consensus locations of major QTL for milk traits is remarkably consistent across breeds. Comparison with the previous published results of a bovine meta-analysis revealed that almost all the linkage regions except the QTL for milk yield on OAR2 (BTA2) and for fat content on OAR8 (BTA9) are present both in sheep and cattle. We foresee the possibility of future studies to conduct a meta-analysis using data of both species. This will also enable the comparison of QTL for other milking traits such as lactation persistency where less information is available in either or both species. For genes relevant to lactation  Lemay et al. [] examined gene loss and duplication  phylogeny  sequence conservation  and evolution using the genomes of a monotreme (platypus)  a marsupial (opossum)  and five placental mammals (bovine  human  dog  mice  rat). Compared with other genes in the bovine genome  milk and mammary genes are more likely to be present in all mammals; more likely to be duplicated in therians; more highly conserved across Mammalia; and evolving more slowly along the bovine lineage []. Their findings support the essentiality of milk to the survival of mammalian neonates and the establishment of milk secretory mechanisms more than 160 million years ago. Lactation has been studied more extensively in  than in any other livestock species  resulting in extensive milk proteome data  identification of milk production QTL  and over 100 000 mammary-related bovine expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The availability of the bovine genome sequence provides unique opportunities to investigate milk and lactation traits. With a known gene density for regions underlying the broad confidence intervals of QTL associated with lactation  each individual QTL is expected to contain between 105 and 127 positional candidate genes []. However  cross-species synteny in QTL location and general conservation of lactation genes across Mammalia  suggests that common ancestral genes may be responsible for variation in lactation performance. Both copy number and sequence variation are likely to contribute to the diversity of milk protein composition across species []. Therefore  further comparisons of sheep and cattle QTL through the use of high density SNP analysis in both species may identify common ancestral genes and chromosomal segments. Despite high resolution fine-mapping tools  the identification of causal genes that underlie QTL remains a challenging task. The use of functional information on lactation networks may in part offer additional insight in selecting positional-functional candidate genes in fine-mapped regions. The use of improved QTL software system such as QTL MatchMaker to integrate and mine QTL information across human  mouse and rat genomes and to annotate functional genomic data [] should accelerate the discovery of causative genes underlying QTL. This will also in part elucidate the question if genes are physically clustered with respect to their known functions or phenotypic effects []. In conclusion  we showed that the application of a mathematical model describing lactation curves of individual ewes is a useful tool to describe milk production of sheep which can then be used for QTL mapping. There is a high degree of consistency of QTL across breeds particular on OAR3  6  20 among diverse studies. The analysis of such studies can the streamlined by online meta-assemblies supported by appropriate browsers. We also present evidence for a number of novel QTL for various milk production traits  from which most (except QTL for milk yield on OAR2 and for fat content on OAR8) were in agreement with QTL mapped to corresponding bovine genome regions. We show the possibility of future studies to conduct a meta-analysis using data of both species. Our data supports evidence that there are ancestral alleles across ruminants which will be eventually confirmed by cross-species meta-assemblies as reported here.

We have analyzed outbred commercial pig populations with different single and multiple models to clarify their genetic properties and in addition  we have investigated pleiotropy among growth and obesity traits based on allelic correlation within a gamete. Three closed populations  (A) 427 individuals from a Yorkshire and Large White synthetic breed  (B) 547 Large White individuals and (C) 531 Large White individuals  were analyzed using a variance component method with one-QTL and two-QTL models. Six markers on chromosome 4 and five to seven markers on chromosome 7 were used. Population A displayed a high test statistic for the fat trait when applying the two-QTL model with two positions on two chromosomes. The estimated heritabilities for polygenic effects and for the first and second QTL were 19%  17% and 21%  respectively.

Analysis of population B using the one-QTL model for three fat traits found a similar peak position on chromosome 7. Allelic effects of three fat traits from the same gamete were highly correlated suggesting the presence of a pleiotropic QTL. In population C  three growth traits also displayed similar peak positions on chromosome 7 and allelic effects from the same gamete were correlated. Detection of the second QTL in a model reduced the polygenic heritability and should improve accuracy of estimated heritabilities for both QTLs. QTLs (quantitative trait loci) in pigs are generally detected with the F design [  ] because the power of detection using the line-cross methodology is greater than that using within-population data [  ]. However  following the QTL reports of Evans . [] and Nagamine . [] in European commercial pig breeds  several authors have identified QTLs in outbred pig populations [–]. To date  several different analysis methods have been applied. The groups of Evans [] and Nagamine [] have used the half-sib regression method [  ]  those of de Koning . [] and Nagamine . [  ] the variance component analysis [  ] and recently  Varona . [] have performed a Bayesian analysis [  ]. One of the advantages of variance component and Bayesian analyses is that these methods explicitly consider not only targeted QTLs but also residual polygenic effects in complicated pedigrees. It is natural to assume that any detected QTL is one of the loci contributing to the polygenic component affecting the trait. Nagamine and colleagues [] have reported the heritabilities of QTLs and residual polygenic effects using the variance component analysis with a one-QTL model  where they indicated that the detected QTL had relatively large effects. However  the heritability of residual polygenic effects on several traits was greater than that from the detected QTL. Simultaneous detection of QTLs using the multiple QTL model may reduce the residual polygenic variance and allow a more accurate estimation of QTLs and polygenic gene effects. It is also important to consider the potential multiple effects of a QTL. For instance  pleiotropy is a phenomenon whereby a single gene affects two or more characteristics []. High phenotypic and polygenic correlations are often reported among growth or obesity traits . [  ]. It is reasonable to assume that a QTL may often act on related traits. Nevertheless  pleiotropic effects of QTLs acting on multiple traits have seldom been investigated in domestic animals. A few reports on pigs have been documented [  ] using line crosses (. F cross). If two linked QTLs are very close  it is difficult to judge whether two separate but linked loci are present or  alternatively  whether there is one QTL acting on two traits [  ]. In a QTL study based on a cross between two lines  the cross generates strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) between linked loci  thus making it very difficult to distinguish linkage from pleiotropy. However  this is not generally the case in an outbred population where LD is usually limited and therefore  a strong correlation between allelic effects of the same parent gamete on two traits can suggest the evidence for pleiotropic effects. Previously  we have detected significant QTLs for growth and obesity traits using least squares [] and variance component analyses [  ] on two chromosomes  4 and 7  in modern commercial pig populations. In this report  we re-analyze these outbred pig populations using two-QTL models to clarify the genetic relationship between polygenes and genes at two QTLs. In addition  we investigate pleiotropy among growth and obesity traits based on allelic correlation on a gamete. Animals from three populations were analysed: (A) 427 individuals from a Yorkshire and Large White synthetic breed  (B) 547 Large White individuals  and (C) 531 Large White pigs individuals (Table ). The populations were structured as half-sib families and the numbers of sires  dams and progeny across the populations ranged from 10 to 11  91 to 146  and 326 to 391  respectively. Groups A  B and C had been maintained as closed populations for at least 15  10 and 16 generations  respectively prior to sampling. Two fat traits (back fat P1 and P2) were analysed in population A and three fat traits (back fat P1 and P3 and loin fat L) in population B. Three growth traits  average daily gain pre test (DGP)  average daily gain on test (DGT)  and average daily gain through the whole life from birth to the end of test (DGW)  were used for population C (Table ). Birth weights were assumed to be zero in order to estimate DGP and DGW. Phenotypic data were measured in the progeny generation only in populations A and C. In population B  phenotypic values from the parental generation were also used. More details are described in the previous papers [  ]. The genotyped markers (relative distance from the first marker: cM) were S0001 (0.0)  SW35 (11.9)  SW839 (15.6)  S0107 (17.1)  SW841 (23.9) and S0073 (28.4) on chromosome 4 for population A. SW1354 (0.0)  SWR1078 (8.9)  TNFB (27.5)  SW2019 (29.3) and S0102 (39.3 cM) on chromosome 7 were genotyped for populations A and B. S0064 (6.4) and SW1344 (17.0) were additionally genotyped on chromosome 7 for population C. The distances between markers were estimated using the mapping software Crimap []. Our model includes sex as a fixed effect and polygenic and QTL genotypic effects as random effects. Random effects can be estimated simultaneously using relationship matrices (additive genetic relationship matrix for polygenetic effects and identity-by-descent (IBD) matrix for QTL genotypic effect). We followed a two-step method described in [] for variance component analysis with IBD matrices constructed by a simple deterministic approach []. Variance components were estimated using ASReml []. Mixed animal models are as follows: where the vector  represents the phenotypic values   is the design matrix for fixed effect  and  is the design matrix for random effects. The remaining vectors are  : polygenic effect   and : QTL genotypic effect for the first and second QTL  respectively  : residual  and : fixed effect. Sex was used as a fixed effect for growth traits  and both sex and regression on end weight were used as fixed effects for fat traits. Matrices  and  are an additive genetic relationship matrix [] for polygenic effects and a unit matrix  respectively.  and  are IBD matrices for variance-covariance of the genotypic effect at QTLs 1 and 2  respectively. Polygenic and residual variances are s and s. Genotypic variance at QTLs 1 and 2 are s and s  respectively. Phenotypic variance  s  is s + s + s + s for the two-QTL model and s + s + s for the one-QTL model. Heritabilities are h (= s/s) for the polygenic effect  and h(= s/s) and h(= s/s) for genotypic effects at QTL 1 and QTL 2  respectively. When a QTL is significant  QTL genotypic effects ( and ) at the peak location are converted into allelic effects using a multiplication with genotypic and allelic IBD matrices. The details of this method were described in a previous paper []. To estimate the presence of a QTL against the null hypothesis (no QTL) at a test position  the likelihood ratio (LR) test statistic LRT = - 2ln(L/L) was calculated  where L and L represent the respective likelihood values under the hypothesis of either the absence (H) or presence (H) of a QTL for the one-QTL model. For the two-QTL model  both the presence of two QTLs against the null hypothesis and the difference between one-QTL and two-QTL models were considered []. The hypotheses for comparing the presence of one QTL in the first position and two QTLs in both the first and second positions are as follows: H: QTL in the first position but no QTL in the second position H: QTLs in both first and second positions. When comparing the hypothesis of one QTL in the second position with that of QTLs in both the first and second positions  then H: QTL presence in the second position but no QTL in the first position  was applied and H was as before. For the hypothesis tests [  ]  a mixture of <U+03C7> distributions with different degrees of freedom was applied. For the two-QTL model  the hypotheses (H: no QTL  H: two QTLs present) were examined with 1/4 <U+03C7> +1/2<U+03C7> +1/4<U+03C7> distribution  and the hypotheses (H: one QTL  H: two QTLs) were tested with 1/2 <U+03C7> + 1/2<U+03C7> distribution. For the one-QTL model  the hypotheses (H: no QTL  H: one QTL present) were examined with 1/2 <U+03C7> + 1/2<U+03C7> distribution. When a QTL is found in a similar genomic region for each of two correlated traits  we can consider that either (1) QTLs for the two traits are linked (linkage) or (2) two traits are controlled by the same gene or genes at that location (pleiotropy). There are some tests to find linked loci that affect a single trait [  ]. However even if there is no proof of linkage  it does not mean that the trait is controlled by a single pleiotropic locus  because we can still argue that the accuracy and power of the test may be insufficient to discriminate between the two situations. Further information provided from denser markers and/or a larger number of generations may reveal the presence of linked loci. Therefore  we do not have a general statistical test to distinguish a pleiotropic locus from linked loci in our analysis scheme. However  we can indicate a theoretical limit of allelic correlation between two traits in a gamete when it is caused by linkage disequilibrium. If allele frequencies do not change across generations  an allelic correlation is determined by a relative size of linkage disequilibrium D []. In a large population  linkage disequilibrium of the base population  D  changes to D at generation t with a recombination rate c []. Thus  even if there is a perfect correlation (= |1|) between two alleles at linked loci on a gamete at the foundation of a population  it will be reduced by random mating in future generations unless linkage is complete (. c = 0.0). For example  population A has been closed for at least 15 generations. In this population  if c is 0.01  (meaning 1 cM between loci)  the size of D relative to the base generation is reduced to 0.86 with t (=15) generations and allelic correlation also changes from 1 to 0.86. If the allelic correlation is more than 0.86 in the current generation  the distance between loci must be less than 1 cM or we can assume a single locus (pleiotropy). In this case we choose the value of allelic correlation greater than 0.86 as a cut off with values above this as being indicative of pleiotropy. We recognize that this choice is somewhat arbitrary and that linked loci may be linked at distances less than 1 cM apart. Note  however  that this is a relatively small window compared with the normal mapping accuracy of QTL studies  for example Gardner . [] have summarized that the average confidence interval around QTLs is 15.6 cM based on more than 200 mapped QTLs. Populations B and C have been closed for at least 10 and 16 generations  respectively. Thus  we chose as criteria values of the allelic correlation of 0.90 (1 cM linkage distance) and 0.82 (2 cM) in population B and 0.85 (1 cM) and 0.72 (2 cM) in population C. The relatively few parents genotyped only represent a small proportion of the whole breeding populations. Therefore  we assumed that effective population sizes are large enough to apply these criteria. When the two-QTL model was applied within chromosome 4 and 7  we observed very slight differences in test statistic values between the one-QTL and two-QTL models. Significant differences between the two models were evident when two single loci in the two chromosomes were used. When one-QTL model was applied for P1 on chromosomes 4 and 7  both chromosomes showed QTLs at the 5% significance level (Table ). The test statistic peaks were at 17 cM on chromosome 4 and 37 cM on chromosome 7 with the one-QTL model (Figures  and ). In the two-QTL model  the peak on chromosome 4 was consistent at 17 cM  but shifted slightly to 34 cM on chromosome 7. The two-QTL model displayed a higher test statistic . 10.32  which was significant against both the one-QTL model using chromosomes 4 and 7 (<0.05)  and the null hypothesis  no QTL (<0.01) (Table ). Here  we call the QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 7 'QTL1 and QTL2'  respectively. The percentages of residual (one-QTL model: 38% and 41%  two-QTL model: 43%) and QTL genetic variances (QTL1: 14% to 17% and QTL2: 18% to 21%) were slightly altered from the one-QTL to the two-QTL model. However  polygenic variances were reduced from 48% (chromosome 4) and 41% (chromosome 7) to 19% (Table ). . . The one-QTL model for P2 on chromosome 7 was significant (P < 0.05) (Table ). Test statistic peaks for P2 were lower than those for P1 (Figures  and ). However  the peak for P2 (17 cM) on chromosome 4 was similar to that for P1. The P2 peak on chromosome 7 was at 35 cM  which was very close to the peak at 37 cM for P1. Polygenic heritabilities in the two-QTL model were much lower than those in the one-QTL model (Tables  and ). Therefore  the estimated total genetic variance  a sum of polygenic and QTL genotypic variances  was similar between the one-QTL and the two-QTL models. For instance  the genetic variance for P2 was 68% (= 62+6) and 68% (= 54+14) in the one-QTL model and 67% (= 44+9+14) in the two-QTL model (Table ). LR test statistic (Figures      and ) curves showed that figures for P1 and P2 were quite similar on chromosomes 4 and 7. QTLs for both P1 and P2 displayed the same peak at 17 cM on chromosome 4. However  the peaks positions on chromosome 7 were slightly different between models and traits  . 37 cM in the one-QTL model and 34 cM in the two-QTL model for P1  and 35 cM in the one-QTL model and 32 cM in the two-QTL model for P2. The differences in test statistic values around these peaks were very small. . Three-dimensional view of QTL on chromosomes 4 and 7. . Three-dimensional view of QTL on chromosomes 4 and 7. The correlation of the allelic effects between P1 and P2 within the gamete from the same parent was highly positive. For instance  the correlation between P1 and P2 was 0.90 within the paternal and 0.94 within the maternal gamete on chromosome 4 (Table ). These allelic correlations are higher than the criterion of 0.86 calculated earlier for an assumed 1 cM linkage distance. We also examined the allelic correlations between the paternal and maternal gametes for each trait. For instance  the correlation between the paternal allelic effect of P1 and maternal allelic effect of P1 was 0.17 on chromosome 4. These allelic correlations between paternal and maternal gametes were 0.12 for P2 (chromosome 4)  0.13 for P1 and 0.13 for P2 (chromosome 7). They suggest weak assortative mating within a line  which may contribute to the allelic correlation in the same gamete. Therefore  we calculated the partial correlations [] using the matrix of correlations between all related paternal and maternal allelic effects. The partial correlations between allelic effects on the same gamete allow us to exclude the effect of assortative mating. However  all allelic correlations in the same gamete showed very little variation (maximum change <0.3%). Three fat traits  P1  P3 and L  from population B  displayed similar peak positions (1 and 2 cM)  and two fat traits  P1 and P3  showed significant test statistics (<0.05) on chromosome 7 (Figure ). The heritabilities for QTLs were 12%  19% and 10% for P1  P3 and L  respectively (Table ). . Allelic effects of the three fat traits within the gamete from the same parent were highly correlated. Two of the allelic correlations between P1 and P3 0.92 and between P1 and L 0.91 within the paternal gamete were higher than a criterion of 0.90 (1 cM linkage distance). Allelic correlations 0.84 within the maternal and 0.86 within the paternal gamete were higher than a criterion of 0.82 (2 cM linkage distance) (Table ). Phenotypic correlations between three fat traits were also very high (0.81 to 0.89). However  the allelic correlations between paternal and maternal alleles between traits were quite low  . 0.09 and 0.16 between P1 and P3 fat. In view of these data (Figure ) and high allelic and phenotypic correlations  we can conclude that it is likely that the three fat traits are controlled by a single pleiotropic locus. Three measures of growth rate  DGP  DGT and DGW  from population C showed the same peak position  6 cM  of LR test statistic on chromosome 7 (Table  and Figure ). Heritabilities for QTLs varied from 6% to 12%  and only DGW displayed significant test statistics (<0.01). . Allelic correlations within a gamete between DGW and DGP (0.94 and 0.87) are higher than a criterion of 0.85 (1 cM linkage distance). Allelic correlations within a gamete between DGW and DGT (0.82 and 0.71) were also high (Table ). However  the allelic correlations between DGP and DGT were relatively low (0.64 and 0.41) and they did not reach the criterion 0.72 (2 cM linkage distance). The phenotypic correlation between DGP and DGT (0.41) is also lower than that between DGP and DGW (0.84) and that between DGT and DGW (0.78). The correlations between paternal and maternal alleles suggest the possibility of weak assortative mating in both populations B and C (Tables  and ). These correlations are very low  . 0.14 for P1  0.09 for P3  0.16 for L (Table ). After adjusting for the effect of assortative mating  allelic correlations in the same gamete showed very little variation (maximum change <0.4%) in populations B and C. The application of a multiple QTL model clarified the genetic properties of our data. The detection of multiple QTLs reduced the polygenic variance  which was previously overestimated in the single QTL model. It is obvious that if we subtract the QTL heritability in one chromosome from the polygenic heritability in the other chromosome in the one-QTL model  the values become quite similar. For instance  if we subtract the heritability of QTL2 (14%) on chromosome 7 from the polygenic heritability of 62% on chromosome 4  it becomes 48% (= 62-14) (Table ). In a similar manner  the polygenic heritability on chromosome 7 will be 48% (= 54-6). Both reduced polygenic heritability values were 48%  and close to the polygene heritability value (44%) from the two-QTL model. The data suggest that the QTL effects on different chromosomes are included in the polygenic effect when the one-QTL model is applied independently on chromosomes 4 and 7. Both QTLs  the first and the second  displayed relatively large heritabilities. The QTL heritability varied from 14% to 21% for P1  and from 6% to 14% for P2 in the one-QTL model and the two-QTL model in population A (Table  and ). The sum of QTL heritabilities in the two-QTL model were 38% (= 17 + 21) (Table ) and 23% (= 9 + 14) (Table ). These heritabilities are in agreement with previous reports. For instance  de Koning . [] have estimated that the QTL heritabilities of fat traits were 8% to 27% across populations and also that heritabilities were high  12% and 27%  on the different chromosomes for a single fat trait within a population. Evans . [] have reported heritabilities of 17% and 8% on different chromosomes in a population. It seems that QTL heritabilities are quite large considering the polygenic heritabilities of the traits concerned []. However  note that we can find QTLs only if they have large effects on phenotypic values. QTLs with a small genetic variance cannot be detected in our analysis scheme. For the two-QTL model  positions of interest on the chromosome were searched in two dimensions []. When we find QTLs in the same region  we can assume that (1) QTLs for two traits are linked (linkage) or (2) two traits are controlled by genes on the same QTL (pleiotropy). Simulations results have shown that it was not easy to distinguish between these two states [  ]. Gilbert . [] have reported that it is difficult to distinguish two linked QTLs within 25 cM using markers every 10 cM. Even markers every 1 cM were insufficient to distinguish two linked QTLs 5 cM apart []. There are some statistical tests for pleiotropy and linkage  which are based on the comparison of different models [    ]. However  if a hypothesis of pleiotropy is chosen because this hypothesis cannot be rejected in favour of the linkage hypothesis (. H: Pleiotropy  H: Linked loci) under their experiment conditions (. limited number of markers)  it might be too easy to conclude on pleiotropy. Gilbert . [] have reported a pleiotropic QTL for a fat trait using various models in an F pig cross population. However  only 10 markers were mapped over 160 cM on chromosome 7. Considering their simulation results []  which demand at least two markers between linked QTLs  it might be difficult to conclude that they would detect pleiotropy in a real data set. Closed populations as used in our paper  are less susceptible to show problems of linkage disequilibrium between linked QTLs. However  mixing a population  . an F population from two divergent selection populations  can lead to strong linkage disequilibrium between linked QTLs. Disequilibrium gives an advantage to F populations for detecting QTLs because it results in particular relationships between marker and genes at the QTL. On the other hand  disequilibrium between genes on a QTL and another QTL makes their positions and effects more difficult to estimate accurately [    ]. In the present paper  we do not provide a general statistical test to distinguish pleiotropy from linked loci. However  we use a criterion  which is based on the distance of linked QTLs (1 and 2 cM)  to investigate pleiotropy using allelic correlation. The choice of the distances (1 and 2 cM) is somewhat arbitrary  however  it is quite a restrictive criterion compared with the normal mapping accuracy of QTL studies. The average confidence interval around QTLs is more than 15 cM in the previous report []. In this paper  we have modeled a simple pleiotropic QTL with alleles affecting two traits with the same direction and having an ideal allelic correlation (=1) in a gamete at the foundation of the population. This is a very restrictive condition since allelic values of a trait are completely correlated to the allelic values of the other trait. If we assume a lower allelic correlation (<1) for the founder generation  the criterion to accept pleiotropy would be lower. Our criterion assuming a high allelic correlation in a gamete can be applied to obviously related traits  (. a series of fat traits). In practice  however  there are various types of pleiotropic effects on multiple traits. It is not guaranteed that the allelic correlation is highly positive even if two traits are controlled by a single QTL [  ]. It would be very difficult to detect all types of pleiotropic QTLs in a marker mapping scheme. The application of a multiple QTL model in real data set is useful in determining the genetic properties of traits  even if loci are located on different chromosomes. Detection of the second QTL in a model reduced the polygenic heritability and it should improve the accuracy in the estimation of heritabilities for both QTLs. Accurate variance estimation on both polygenes and QTL genes could improve selection schemes for animals. Our results suggest that pleiotropy is not a rare phenomenon among highly related traits (. obesity traits).

Extensions of the model to genomic selection and multi-QTL mapping are straightforward. Linkage analysis (LA) is a popular tool for QTL detection and localization. Its accuracy is limited by the number of meioses observed in the studied pedigree  which can represent several centiMorgan. Linkage disequilibrium (LD  also called gametic phase disequilibrium) is the non-random association among different loci  and is increasingly used in human and agricultural association studies for gene mapping. The joint use of LD and LA (also called LDLA) permits to map QTL more accurately than LA while retaining its robustness to spurious associations  and this technique has been applied in human []  plant []  and livestock [] populations. This is achieved by explicitely modelling relatedness not accounted for in association analysis []. LDLA is also robust to non-additive modes of inheritance []. In addition  the joint use of LD and LA makes it possible to test linkage alone or linkage disequilibrium separately []. A characteristic of plants and livestock is that often  close pedigree relationships exist and are recorded among the individuals genotyped for QTL detection (e.g.  bulls or plant varieties)  and including these relationships in the analyses can be worthwhile. In livestock  several approaches have been proposed to take into account LD information within LA [    ]. These methods model the process generating LD among the putative QTL and the surrounding markers; this process can quickly become unmanageable in the general case []  and even difficult to approximate [–]. Extensions of LD models to include LA (that is  the cosegregation of markers and QTL due to physical linkage) are cumbersome for the general case [] or restricted to certain pedigree structures like half-sibs families (C. Cierco  pers. comm.). The parameters of LD generating processes can be either estimated from the data  which is often difficult  or fixed a priori which is unsatisfactory. The existence or not of these events in the past history of a population is unknown. Therefore the validity of any assumptions is largely unknown. An alternative is QTL mapping by simple association (regression in the case of quantitative traits) of phenotypes on marker alleles  which has been s.hown to be an effective method [  ]  while retaining simplicity; this is widely used in human genetics []. On the other hand  QTL mapping in livestock by LA relies heavily on the use of half- and full-sibs families and relatively simple ascertainment of phases and transmission probabilities (e.g. []). For this reason  Haley-Knott type regressions for simple designs [] and variance component methods for more complex designs [] are well adapted  computationally simpler and almost as good [  ] as full integrated likelihoods [  ]. Linear models are appealing for their ease of use and understanding and good performance. In this work  we combine association analysis with probabilities of transmission using conditional expectations. Ultimately  we come up with linear models for joint association and linkage mapping  which are generalizations of LA mapping. Two particular cases will be detailed: a half-sib regression which applies in many livestock practical settings  and a general mixed model approach valid for any type of pedigree. This section is organised as follows. In the subsection \"Splitting QTL effects\"  we show how to come up with expectations for gametic QTL effects integrating association and linkage. The following two subsections \"LDLA Haley-Knott type regression\" and \"Variance components mapping\" explicitly present two linear models (Haley-Knott type regression for half-sib families and a general mixed model for a general pedigree) and the statistical tests that lead to QTL detection  location  and ascertainment of the hypothesis linkage  association  both or lack of both. Numerical examples and performance of the methods are illustrated by simulations in subsection \"Illustrations\"  under two different scenarios. In this section we will show how QTL effects can be split in a part conditional on LD in the founders and cosegregation  and another part which is unconditional on LD in the founders. This results in a flexible linear model setting. Throughout the paper  we will assume a polymorphic QTL with an unknown number of alleles : { }  with effects = ( ); dominance is not considered. Let  denote the additive effects of all gametes -carriers of QTLs- in a population; this will be referred to as \"gametic effects\" (e.g. []). In the following we consider haplotypes  which are phased markers  i.e.  a set of 1  2  or several ordered markers on the same chromosome. Haplotypes can be classified in classes. Classes can be formed by simple classification or by more sophisticated techniques such as cluster analysis [  ]. For the sake of discussion we will assume that haplotypes are composed of two markers with a putative QTL located at the middle  but our approach is general and conditional only on the existence of haplotype classes. In all the following  we generally consider a single position in the genome. This position is situated on a specific chromosome number of the physical map or karyotype; for example  BTA14. In a diploid species  each individual has two copies of each chromosome: one from the paternal side and one from the maternal side. Identification of the origin of each chromosome copy is not always possible. In the following  when referring to any given chromosome pair containing a specific locus of the genome and to distinguish the two chromosome copies  we shall note them 1 and 2. The haplotype (-th chromosome in -th individual   = {1  2}) can be assigned to a haplotype class  through a function ( ) acting on a haplotype . In its simplest form  ( ) is a lookup table. So  for the case of two flanking SNPs  classes are 1 to 4  composed of haplotypes 00  01  10 and 11. The number of haplotype classes at the candidate position is . We assume that linkage disequilibrium exists between haplotype classes and QTL alleles. Conditional on each haplotype class  population frequencies for a QTL state are denoted by matrix = { }. That is  the probability of QTL state  conditional to haplotype class  is Pr( = |) = . Assuming linkage equilibrium  =  = =   the marginal population frequency of the -th allele of the QTL. In this situation  haplotype classes are not informative on QTL states. However  given disequibrium between the markers loci and the QTL locus    ... will vary among the different haplotype classes. The haplotype of a founder individual  on chromosome  is  and belongs to a class  (() = ). The distribution of additive gametic effect  conditional on  is determined by : and the expectation of  conditional on the haplotype is: Neither the  effects nor the  proportions are known in practice. Thus  we propose to substitute the summation <U+2211>by a term ; that is  to substitute the weighted effects of QTL alleles for each haplotype class by the overall within-class mean. This amounts to considering as the \"substitution effect\"  at the population level  of the haplotype. This is precisely what is done in association analysis of quantitative traits. The set of different haplotype substitution effects is = { }. In this new formulation: Now   can be modelled as the sum of a conditional expectation plus a deviation:   where this deviation (assuming the true state of the QTL is ) is  as above. The deviation  has a discrete distribution with possible states {( - ) (- )} with probabilities {  }  which are generally unknown. For a non-founder individual   let  be the probability that the QTL allele at chromosome  of individual  is inherited from the QTL allele at chromosome  of its father; and let  probability that allele at chromosome  is inherited from the chromosome  of its mother. In the absence of marker information  these are 0.5. Assume that these probabilities have been computed  conditional on all marker information ()  using one of several methods [  –]. We will refer to these probabilities as PDQ's (probability of descent for a QTL allele) []; they can be put together in a row vector (while each PDQ is a conditional probability  we do not explicitly include  in the notation for simplicity in the following expressions). where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two QTL alleles of the sire and the dam. In the expression above  four probabilities are needed because maternal and paternal origin can not always be stablished with certainty [] and  for the same reason  labels 1 and 2 are used instead of \"paternal\" and \"maternal\" for each QTL allele in each individual. Elements in sum to 1. The conditional distribution of   the gametic effect  is a discrete set of QTL effects   with probabilities dependent on  first  the QTL state of its parents; and second  on the probabilities of transmission of these parental QTLs towards . That is: In particular  if the parents of  are among the founders  then it follows that: It follows that the expectation of  conditional on marker information and the rest of parameters is then simply: which  if the parents are founders  is: because of the properties of expectations (i.e.  we can factor out ) That is  the expected value of a gametic effect is equal to the substitution effects of the parents' haplotypes  weighted by the corresponding transmission probabilities. This is a particular case of a general  recursive formula that also works if the parents of the individual are non-founders themselves: The   the deviation of  with respect to its expectation has states  with associated probabilities  which are conditional on marker information as well. The two building blocks in the previous section (modelling of expectations of gametic effects in founders by LD  and of non founders by conditioning on founders and LA) allow us to construct several linear models considering LD  LA  or both. In the next two sections  we will detail two linear models including LD and LA for cases commonly used in livestock genetics: a regression approach applied to idealized pedigree structures (half-sib families)  and a more flexible variance component approach which can be used for general pedigree structures. Consider  sires with  marker information. Assume further that QTL states at the sires are independent  conditional on their haplotypes and the corresponding conditional probabilities (i.e. we assume no other relationship among sires beyond haplotype similarities  which is usual in this type of regression []). Suppose each of the  sires is mated to several dams with one daughter per dam - a half-sib design. As before  let  be the probability that the QTL allele at chromosome  of individual  is inherited from chromosome  of the sire; let  be the probability that the QTL allele at chromosome  is inherited from chromosome  of the dam; these PDQ's  computed based on   can be put together in a matrix . The expectation of the phenotype of a given offspring  from sire  and dam   conditional on its parents' gametic effects is: Gametic effects can be split  as shown above. A part is conditional on linkage disequilibrium in the founders (())  which in turn can be conditioned on haplotype substitution effects . Another part is not conditional on linkage disequilibrium at the founders (*). Then: Note that  in the preceding expression  we assume that haplotypes in the sire and dam are known with certainty. Assuming paternal () and maternal () origins can be established with certainty  it is possible to further simplify the expression by condensing dams' information. First  it is possible to condition only on the deviations * in the sire  because in this design *'s for the dams are generally difficult to estimate and non-estimable in least-squares regression. Second  we can assume that the proportions  in the founders are still accurate one generation later - that is  the decay of LD is slow  which holds for short distances (˜ 1% per generation in intervals of 1 cM). If this holds  it is possible to change the weighted substitution effect of the two haplotypes in the dam   and   to the substitution effect of the haplotype found in the maternally inherited chromosome of descendant (). This strategy was followed by Farnir et al. []. Then: where is a row vector with the two PDQ's from chromosomes 1 and 2 in the sire towards the paternal chromosome in . Extension to  sires is immediate: where are the PDQ's from sires to paternal chromosome in the offspring;  is the set of \"residual\" gametic effects in the sires; and and are incidence matrices relating  haplotypes in the sires  and maternal haplotypes in the offspring  to appropriate elements in . Last  and are appropriate incidence matrices relating paternal and maternal gametes in the progeny to records. This conditional expectation immediately translates into a statistical model: where  is a vector of residuals. This model can be fitted by  for example  least-squares. Tests for QTL detection and location using interval mapping can be done by likelihood ratio or F-tests  assuming homoscedasticity of variances. Variances are indeed not homogeneous  for example  if a QTL is fixed within a haplotype class but not in another. The non consideration of dam effects also inflates the residual variance. Note  in addition  that the model is generally not full-rank:  effects are non estimable within-sire (but their contrasts are). The  coefficients will be estimable if they are not confounded with any  gametic effect; that is  if no haplotype class is present in one sire only. However  this does not create any problem for QTL localization and detection. An interesting property of the model is that it is a generalization of Haley-Knott regression [  ]  which occurs if we assume linkage equilibrium among founder haplotypes. Note that spurious signals due to  for example  stratification  are unlikely in this model because there is a verification  through linkage (i.e. the PDQ's) that associated haplotypes are transmitted to the next generation and still have an effect. This breaks down spurious associations that would be observed at the founders' level. A simplified model  which does not include the * effects is: This expression models appropriately the cosegregation of markers and those QTL in LD with them. We call this model \"LD decay\" because it models appropriately the decay of initial LD existant in the founders by tracing the effect of the different segments through the pedigree with the aid of flanking markers  i.e.  by linkage. However  it would not detect a QTL in the case of LE. Many tests are possible using the statistical model in equation (). Usually (for example in interval mapping)  several possible QTL locations are tested simultaneously or sequentially. For a particular putative QTL location  the null hypothesis is the non-segregation of alleles of the QTL having different effects. This implies that all haplotype substitution effects  as well as the * deviations  have the same value. This amounts to a common overall mean for the data  with = 0   = 0. There are three alternative hypothesis depending on the existence of complete linkage disequilibrium  only linkage  or both. The four hypothesis are:   (null hypothesis): No cosegregation markers-QTL effects (i.e. no linkage) and no linkage disequilibrium among haplotypes-QTL: = 0   = 0.  : Complete linkage disequilibrium at the founders: <U+2260> 0   = 0.  : Linkage equilibrium at the founders but cosegregation markers-QTL effects: = 0   <U+2260> 0.  : Incomplete linkage disequilibrium at the founders and residual cosegregation markers-QTL effects: <U+2260> 0   <U+2260> 0 In addition  it is possible to test H against H and H. Extension to a variance components or mixed model mapping framework [    ] is possible [  ]. As before  let  be the gametic effects for all the QTL gametes in the population. We will show how the first and second moments of the joint distribution of  can be constructed  conditional on marker information and within haplotypic classes means and variances. Following previous notation  the following recursive equation for gametic effects holds: Each gametic effect is modelled as (i) a weighted average of the gametic effects of its ancestors (for non-founder individuals) or of haplotypic effects (for founder individuals)  plus (ii) independent random variables due to mendelian sampling []  . The expression (15) potentially includes non-founder gametic effects in the progeny of non-founder animals  allowing for generality and multigenerational pedigrees. Note that  is partitioned into founders and non-founders  and all subsequent partitioned matrices. In particular   can be partitioned accordingly  so that rows tracing the origin of founder gametes from other gametes in the population are formed by 0's. Note that the setting is very similar to a genetic groups model []. Rules for computing the first and second moments of the distribution of the gametic effects  follow []. The development is as in previous sections. Let  be the probability that gamete  came from haplotypic class . In general  for the -th allele of the -th individual  For founder alleles  conditionally on the haplotype   this is simply the mean of the corresponding haplotypic class  that is   as  is 1 for  = () and 0 for anything else. For non-founders  a recursive equation holds: and therefore: where is a matrix of PDQ's as before  and  and  indicate the gametes in the father and mother. From expression (15) []. Thus  another representation in matrix algebra is: where ( - ) represents summation over all possible paths of transmission from ancestors to descendants  and  represents the expected franction of founder gametes in the descendant gametes []. Matrix is an incidence matrix relating founder gametes to founder haplotypic classes. Matrix  can be recursively computed using equation (). These expressions are similar to the QTL crossbred model [  ]  save for groups for founders  which are based on haplotype classes instead of breeds. Any  gamete can in principle be traced to one or several founder populations (i.e.  haplotypic classes). Had the gamete come from the haplotype class   its conditional variance of the gametic effect  would be just   where   the average gametic effect in class . As the number of QTL alleles and their distribution are unknown  the different  are parameters to be estimated in the model. However  the  gamete can come from several origins  each with probability ; therefore  the distribution of the gametic effect  is a mixture. Conditioning on all possible origins  = (1  ... )  which can be expanded [] to: where the computations of  and have been previously shown. Note that this expression reduces to the classical one [] under linkage equilibrium. As modelled here  the conditional covariance of two gametic effects depends on the event that they are identical by descent in the observed pedigree. Let  and  be two gametes  with indexes arranged so that  can be a descendant of  but not the opposite. The QTL allele at the gamete  is one of the four gametes of its parents   and . The conditional covariance between the gametic values  and  is then: where the covariances in the right hand side are also conditional on  and . This formula is the same as for the case of linkage equilibrium in the founders [  ]. However  the variances differ due to the different haplotype origins  and the covariances will not be the same as those under linkage equilibrium. A linear model including gametic effects is: where  and  are incidence matrices and  is a vector of fixed effects. Residuals  are normally distributed | ~ MVN(  )  where MVN stands for multivariate normal  and  = . Further  assume normality for  (this is an approximation). Then    where  and  (the covariance matrix of gametic effects) are computed as above in equations (  ). Under this assumption of normality  the distribution of  is: where  =  +   and the likelihood is: Using this likelihood  Bayesian techniques or maximum likelihood techniques can be used to infer parameters of the model and location of the QTL. In particular  mixed model equations are: Note that  can be easily constructed using partitioned matrix rules []. These equations might not be convenient because  is found on the right hand side. An alternative formulation uses that is  using * =    which has zero expectation. The mixed model equations are then []: Note that  enter non-trivially into . For the maximum likelihood techniques  derivative-free techniques might be used with equation (). For the Bayesian approach  albeit the \"data augmentation\" of gametic effects in (23) or (24) partly simplifies computations  the full posterior conditionals of  do not have closed forms; Metropolis-Hastings might be used. Other possible simplifications are: Supress * from the model in (24)  i.e.  =  +  + . This implicitely assumes: (i) QTL alleles are fixed within haplotype class; and (ii) transmissions are known with certainty (i.e. PDQ's are either 0 or 1). Under these two conditions  Var(*) = 0. This might happen for very dense marker maps where markers are fully informative on QTL state and transmissions. The result is a least-squares estimator as follows: Assume constant variances across classes and  further  that PDQ's are known with certainty. If this is the case  Var(*) =  and standard algorithms and software (e.g.  REML) can be used. If variances are not constant within class but each gametic effect can be asigned exactly to a class  (i.e. PDQ's are either 0 or 1)  then its variance is . This is a mixed model with heterogeneity of variances. This assumption is similar to that by Pérez-Enciso and Varona []. Again  the null hypothesis is the non-segregation of QTL effects  that is  all haplotype substitution effects  as well as the  deviations  have a null value; save that * are now random effects. The four hypotheses are:   (null hypothesis): No segregation of QTL effects (i.e. no linkage) and no linkage disequilibrium haplotype-QTL: .  : Complete linkage disequilibrium at the founders: .  : Linkage equilibrium: .  : Incomplete linkage disequilibrium at the founders: . We will show how the terms in both linear models are set up. Consider the pedigree and markers in Table . We assumed a distance of 30 cM between markers and a QTL placed at the middle. Note that  assuming few recombinations  transmissions in the pedigree are simple to follow. From this information  it can be inferred that a recombination has occurred to form the sire gamete in 6. Consider sires 2 and 5 (assuming they are unrelated) and phenotypes of offspring (4 to 6 for sire 2 and 7 and 8 for sire 5). We need to set up the incidence matrix relating  to sires' haplotypes () and maternal-inherited haplotypes (). Let levels 1 to 4 in  represent haplotypes 00  01  10  11. Then: Assuming chromosome origins were established with certainty  probabilities of transmission are 0.98 for the non-recombinant and 0.02 for the recombinants (actually  double recombinants) if markers were transmitted together  or 0.5 if they were not. The matrix of PDQ's is thus: There are four (twice the number of sires) gametic sire effects . Last  and are 5 × 5 identity matrices for records of individuals 4 to 8. Note that animal 5 is in the analysis both as sire and as offspring. The final equations () are thus: In order to construct the mixed model equations we assume certain values for the class substitution effects  = [0.9  0.5  0.5  0.1] and for the within-class variances  = (0.09  0.25  0.25  0.09) (in practice these values have to be estimated). Setting up the matrix  for the founders implies just setting the element corresponding to the -th haplotype of the -th founder and the  () class to 1  and all other to zero. Gametic effects are ordered within each animal. Then the first six rows of  are: where the first two rows correspond to animal 1  the next two to animal 2  and so on. Let's take non-founder animal 4. Its rows in  are the product of the corresponding PDQ's times the rows in  corresponding to their parents 2 (sire) and 1 (dam). That is: The process is repeated for every individual. Individual 7 is descendant of two non-founders (sire is 5 and dam is 4)  but the same logic applies. Matrix  is then: To compute the variance we apply (19). For founders  variances are  for the first gamete in 1   for the second   for the first gamete in 2  and so on. For non-founders  let consider for example gamete 2 in individual 4 and gamete 2 in individual 6. Note that the terms  are contained in matrix  above. If we apply the formula and ignore null terms (those  = 0): and We can see that the higher uncertainty in the origin of  results in a higher variance. As for the covariances  these were computed using the algorithm of Wang et al. []. The final covariance matrix  is: First  four simulations were carried out to check the behaviour of the different methods for fine mapping. We used the LDSO software for the simulations (F. Ytournel  pers. comm)  a set of programs developed at INRA (T. Druet  F. Guillaume  pers. comm.) for phase determination and computation of PDQs  and user-written programs for setting up and solving the linear models. The first set of scenarios will be termed as \"drift\". Two sub-scenarios differing on the size of the region of interest (5 or 20 cM) were designed. A 5 (alternatively  20) cM region with 21 SNP markers (i.e.  20 brackets)  with a biallelic QTL at position 2.125 (alternatively  8.5) cM (at the middle of the 9th bracket). The QTL was biallelic with an effect of 1 for the second allele. No foundational event was assumed (i.e.  marker and QTL alleles were assigned at random in the ancestral population). SNP alleles were assigned at random in the founders. This population evolved during 100 generations with an effective size of 100. Therefore the only source of LD was drift. After these populational events  a daughter design was simulated  with 15 sires each with 20 daughters. Phenotypes were simulated according to the QTL effects and to a residual variance of 1; no polygenic effects were simulated. This is a scenario where IBD methods are likely to perform well. Although the design is fairly small for dairy cattle  it is not unlikely for swine or sheep  and our purpose was not to provide a large amount of information. The second two scenarios (\"admixture\") are radically different and include strong admixture. Again  5 and 20 cM region are considered  with same positions for the QTL. Initially  two breeds existed differing in their polygenic average by 1. A QTL is considered with equal frequency in each breed  with an effect of 1 for the second allele. SNP alleles were assigned at random in the founders. Both breeds were crossed and a mixed population of 50 individuals evolved during 20 generations. A daughter design as before was simulated. Phenotypes were simulated according to the QTL  the inherited polygenic part of each breed  and a residual variance of 1. This scenario might generate admixture by drift if one SNP locus is indicative of breed origin. We compared the performances of five different methods: (1) LA: Haley-Knott linkage analysis []  (2) LDLA: the regression LDLA method in this work (equation 13)  (3) LD decay: LDLA regression by equation ()  that is  ignoring the * terms  (4) two-marker: regression on two-marker haplotypes (i.e.  association analysis)  and (5) an IBD method [  ]  which computes IBD among founders based on all markers (Lee  pers. comm.). The simplest approach is to perform single marker association analysis  which has been shown to be as good as more complex methods in quite a variety of scenarios []. We nevertheless discarded this option because the simulation method places the QTL in the middle of a bracket. This automatically penalizes the single-marker analysis. Further  by using always two markers we can compare all methods in the same grounds (except IBD). For the two-marker and IBD method  phases were assumed to be known with certainty; this might have resulted in slightly optimistic results. Performance of the different methods was based on the average error (i.e.  the bias  in cM) and the mean square error (MSE  in cM). All simulated populations had a minor allele frequency of 0.1 at least for the QTL. One hundred replicates were run. Tables  and  show the results of the simulations for the \"drift\" scenario and Tables  and  for the \"admixture\" scenario. In the \"drift\" scenario  LA and IBD methods are biased for the 5 cM scenario  and the IBD method is biased for the 20 cM scenario. The ranking of the methods changes with the scenario  with LA being always the worst in accuracy  as expected. The reason of the inability of LA to map the QTL is simple: in small intervals  recombinations - which are needed for LA to map a QTL-seldom occur. Thus  in the 5 cM scenario  the performance of LA is roughly equivalent to random mapping of the QTL. For the remaining methods  differences are indeed largely non-significant except for the bias. Figure  shows a plot of estimated locations in the 100 simulations vs the QTL position in the \"drift 5 cM\" scenario. From the graph  it is clear that the IBD method tends towards the center of the haplotype  whereas the other methods are the less biased. The LDLA method is somewhere in the middle. . Errors (in cM) in location of the QTL by the different methods - drift and 5 cM scenario. The small triangle is the center of the segment; the small diamond is the QTL location. Figure  shows the interval mapping profile of the p-value along the chromosome for four replicates of the \"drift 5 cM\" scenario. It can be seen that the signal of association (i.e. two-marker) is considerably smoothed by the LDLA and IBD methods; this might compromise detection power (not addressed here). It is also apparent that the IBD methods look like a weighted average of signals of close markers; this results in smoothing but also in uncertainty. . Interval mapping profiles (minus log of the p-value) in four replicates of the drift and 5-cM scenario. LA: dotted line. LDLA: continuous line. LD decay: red  stars. Two-marker: blue  triangles. IBD: grey dot-dash line. A diamond indicates the QTL location. Most of these results are due to the multimarker nature  in this order  of LA  IBD and LDLA  which might tend to point central regions since  in these  haplotypes are more informative and PDQ's are better calculated. This is alleviated in the LDLA method and LD decay method by the implicit two-marker association analysis. As for the admixture scenario  Table  shows basically that QTL location cannot be accurately estimated. The reason is that the scenario is not informative enough due to the low number of historical recombinations and the noise added by admixture. Differences in performances (MSE) of the different methods are not statistically significant; however  LA  LDLA and LD decay do show some bias. The 20 cM admixture scenario (Table ) shows much worse performance of the mapping methods than in the drift scenario; and this  for the same reasons as above: few historical recombinations and noise added by admixture. LA is the worst method in terms of MSE  whereas the LD decay method is the best. However  differences are not significant  and no clear conclusions can be drawn. The profiles in Figure  are indeed very chaotic  and they would be difficult to interpret in real-life experiments. .

IBD: grey dot-dash line. A diamond indicates the QTL location. We have presented a method for joint association and linkage  which belongs to a more general class of joint linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis. In fact  existing methods belong to one of two exclusive classes: those that model somehow the LD phenomena and those that do not. Some models [  ] assumed a mutation followed by expansion of the mutant haplotype. The pertinency of this scenario in general agricultural populations (and indeed in complex diseases in humans) is arguable. The likelihood in Farnir et al. [] was an approximation  based on the assumption of independence among contiguous markers; and the form of the likelihood was only appropriate for family designs. The more complex model in Pérez-Enciso [] holds for any pedigree structure below the founders  but computations were difficult. Models for association and linkage in human populations exist [  ]. These  although very similar to our approach  are difficult to apply to livestock since they are rigidly family-structured; in addition  the QTDT [] uses unilocus information only for transmission events  whereas in our model it is possible -- and recommended -- to use multilocus information to compute the PDQ's  and it is possible (but perhaps not useful) to define haplotype classes spanning several loci. Conversely  the QTDT has no need of PDQ calculation or - possibly - map ordering of SNPs. The most popular model for LDLA QTL detection in livestock has been reported by Meuwissen et al. [] and has been fairly used [  ]. The method relies on the construction of a matrix of covariances among founders (the so-called IBD probabilities)  say   based on identity of state among markers; these IBD probabilities are derived following approximate coalescent models [      ]. IBD methods use the same parameter (the variance assigned to the QTL) for both covariance due to association and covariance due to linkage. Modelling linkage and association using different parameters ( and ) allows for a greater flexibility in our model. This can be explained as follows. Suppose we have two marker loci flanking a QTL. Assume that LD is generated by some random process such as drift or mutation. Then  given this LD generation (LG) event  the expected value of the effect of gamete  for a founder individual  is denoted by For SNP markers  there will be four possible values for the haplotypes. Let  denote the vector of the four variables. In our approach   is treated as a fixed effect. However  over LG events   can be thought of as random. Suppose the LG process is such that the expected value of  over LG events is and the covariance matrix of  over LG events is The matrix  will depend of the LG process  and in the IBD method of Meuwissen and Goddard [  ]  it is the matrix of IBD probabilities at the QTL conditional on the observed marker data. Thus  when marginalized over the LG events  the mean and variance of do not depend on the marker haplotype. Similarly  the marginal (or unconditional) variance of  does not depend on the marker haplotype  and it is denoted by  It follows that the unconditional variance of is Now  using notation in our paper  the covariance matrix of gametic effects of the founders can be written as The covariance matrix for the entire vector of gametic effects can be computed  recursively  using equation () in our paper  starting with the covariance matrix in equation (). If there is no LD   will be zero and (29) will reduce to the   which is the covariance matrix under LE. Also  (29) depends on two variance components that relate to the gametic variance due to LD and the remainder. In the IBD method [  ]  Var() is written as   where  is an IBD matrix with diagonals equal to 1 and off-diagonals given by . Thus  in the IBD method [  ] the partitioning of the gametic variance due to LD and the remainder is entirely dependent of the assumptions underlying the computation of . A practical problem using IBD methods (our experience is with the IBD methods [])  is that often matrix  turns out to be negative definite; hence the likelihood of the phenotypes is undefined. The reason is that construction of  is not based on a joint distribution for all founder chromosomes  but it is computed for two haplotypes (or chromosomes) at a time  marginalizing over the rest. This leads to approximate marginal probabilities in  instead of a joint distribution. Thus  the estimated  matrix is at best an approximation. A way to deal with non-positive definiteness is bending []  or clustering (a data reduction technique) []. Both approaches might result in a loss of information  have unknown statistical properties and are subject to arbitrary tuning parameters. At any rate  both modelling the LD phenomena and IBD based models rely in assumed population events. The robustness of these methods to  for example  admixtured breeds  is largely unknown and difficult to verify. Our model and those by Fernando et al. and Gilbert et al. [  ] do not model the process generating LD among QTL and markers  and therefore are more general. The only strong assumption that they made was that of a biallelic QTL  which is overcome in ours  at the price of a greater number of unknowns. The originality of our approach is that (i) it is feasible and well-taylored for some agricultural populations  in particular livestock (because it relies on phase and transmission information easily ascertainable  and holds for any family structure) and corn (where indeed a similar idea -- nested association -- has been developed [])  (ii) it is a linear model (with all the adequate machinery)  while (iii) at the same time providing  based on expectations and covariances  a simple and coherent linear-models framework for association and linkage and (iv) reduces to well-known models on the hypothesis of LE or complete LD. Indeed  our models allows us to test the four relevant hypotheses (disequilibrium  linkage  both or none) and reduces to association or linkage under the respective hypothesis  which is not the case for other methods such as IBD models for example  which assume that LD exists. Our method is computationally simple to use  provided that phases and PDQ's can be accurately calculated. If this is not the case  inference is possible  in principle  by integrating over all the joint distribution of phases and transmissions. After phase determination and computation of PDQs  all the machinery of the linear models can be applied. This makes it possible to include simultaneously other effects (environmental effects  polygenic effects) and the use of other tools such as permutation tests  bootstrapping and in particular the simultaneous fit of several QTLs []. The latter one is of particular interest for recent developments in genome-wide genetic evaluation (\"genomic selection\") using LDLA. For example  the number of simultaneous effects fitted by Calus et al. [] was ~ 600 000 for two-marker haplotypes in a genome composed of ~ 2300 markers. If a \"LD decay model\" is used (such as equation ) the number of equations is linear in the number of loci  while retaining the use of LD and of some of the LA. Even with the full linkage and association model (equation 24)  sparsity of the mixed model equations is guaranteed. A practical problem with the method is how to define \"classes\" of haplotypes; for example  how many markers to include in the definition of the classes. Including more markers in the definition of the haplotype is straightforward  but probably at the price of greater complexity. The optimal number of markers seems scenario dependent [  ]. A practical rule of thumb is to define classes that are manageable - that is  not too many. For example  Druet et al. [] considered haplotypes spanning either 3 or 10 markers  with a number of classes of 8 and 700  respectively. The latter were too many and had to be clustered. They observed that 3-marker haplotypes provided narrower intervals than 10-marker haplotypes  at the possible price of more false-positive detections. With multiallelic markers the two-loci classes might be impractical. Two options might be (i) to consider the closest microsatellite  or (ii) to split the effect of a haplotype class in a sum of individual marker locus effects. In this option a descendant of haplotype  say  \"13\" with probability  would be in expectation  times the effect of allele 1 at the first locus  plus  times the effect of allele 3 at the second locus. Computations for any of the regression methods (LA  LDLA  LD decay and two-marker) were extremely fast. For the case of LDLA  computing one position took 0.02 seconds. For the IBD method  each position took about 40 seconds. Results show no clear ranking of methods. Indeed  the fact that the IBD method is often biased deserves further attention for small chromosomal segments  albeit its good performance in the drift 20-cM simulation shows the value of multi-marker information in relatively sparse maps. The LD decay method is possibly the best across all scenarios  but the two-marker regression analysis is almost as good. Zhao et al. [] have shown that the even simpler method of single-marker regression performed slightly better than two-marker regression. Thus  future work should compare our methods (LDLA or LD decay) with single-marker association. The admixture simulation shows basically that the extra noise generated affected all methods for localization of QTLs; whether this holds for detection remains to be seen. Thus  more extensive simulations need to be undertaken to compare accuracy  power  and robustness to spurious associations of the different methods. It seems  nevertheless  that our linear model (LDLA or LD decay) is at least as good in performance as the IBD method  while keeping simplicity. In fact  for small chromosomal segments  association between QTL and markers is very informative [  ]. As an aside  simulations should not place the QTL at the center of the segment as this hides bias of the methods and artificially decreases MSE. It is expected that  for narrower and narrower marker intervals  most information will be captured by the LD term and less by the LA terms. At the limit  if the QTL  the marker  the variance for the gametic effect  (*) will be null and all information will be contained in . On the other hand  for very distant markers  variance of  will be high and  will tend to zero. Still  linkage will still be used in modelling the pedigree transmission of fully associated marker effects. We have presented simple linear models for QTL detection and localization including populational linkage disequilibrium and within-family cosegregation. The methods uses all available information (i.e.  multiple markers and pedigrees). The performance of these methods is satisfactory  as shown by simulations. These methods are computationally much simpler than other proposals. Extensions to multiple QTL mapping and genomic selection are straightforward. These methods should help researchers in QTL mapping and marker assisted selection  in particular in livestock species  where the required information is available  just like regression is more used than full-likelihood methods []  when possible.

Due to the lower number of groups  the empirical PEV of breeding values was smaller when genetic groups were fuzzy-classified. Fuzzy-classification provides the potential to describe the genetic level of unknown parents in a more parsimonious and structured manner  and thereby increases the precision of predicted breeding values. Historically  genetic groups have been included in genetic evaluation models to account for selection not described by known genetic relationships. Introduction of animal models  which makes is possible to account for known relationships in the genetic evaluation  reduced the need for genetic groups [  ]. However  in practice  genetic evaluations can by hampered by incomplete pedigrees  due to  for example  deficiencies in pedigree recording systems and importation of animals. An animal whose parent(s) are unknown can be assigned so-called phantom parents. These phantom parents are assumed to be unrelated  non-inbred and to have a single descendant. Phantom parents themselves are not of interest  but are considered only to facilitate modelling and computations []. The strategy for assigning unknown parents to genetic groups should reflect the average genetic level of unknown parents []. Differences in the genetic level between sub-populations of unknown parents are a good reason to form genetic groups for each sub-population  thereby avoiding the assumption that base animals belong to a single population. Common factors considered in the definition of genetic groups for unknown parents are birth year of progeny  selection intensity (selection path) and origin [–]. Except for a few examples where genetic groups are clearly distinct  definitions of genetic groups are often based on arbitrary rules. An accurate modelling of the expected breeding values of unknown parents will lead to the creation of many groups  each one with only a few animals. However  the drawbacks of such a strategy are either confounding with other fixed effects in the model [] or imprecise solutions for genetic group effects. Thus  definition of genetic groups should not be too precise to yield sufficiently large groups. Moreover  if incorrect information about a base animal's attributes (e.g.  birth year and origin) is used to assign the unknown parents to a group  then genetic groups will not reflect the expected genetic merit of the unknown parents. These aspects of uncertainty and inaccuracy are usually not adequately handled in the allocation of unknown parents to genetic groups. To improve the adjustment for seasonal effects in the genetic evaluation  Strandberg and Grandinson [] have suggested to assign a cow's record partially to the herd-year-season of calving  and partially to the closest adjoining class. They have labelled the approach \"fuzzy classification\"  after fuzzy logics  a methodology used in expert systems to handle inexact reasoning. The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for fuzzy classification of phantom parent groups in an animal model. This approach is illustrated with a simulation  where fuzzy-classified genetic groups are used to handle uncertainty about the time of birth. In addition  the possibility to model a linear time trend in the average genetic level of phantom parents with a small number of genetic groups will be illustrated. The infinitesimal model assumes that an animal's breeding value is the sum of the parent average and a Mendelian sampling deviation that resembles the random process of sampling parental genotypes (e.g. []): where and are the additive genetic value and Mendelian sampling deviation for animal   respectively  and  and  are the sire and dam of animal . In matrix representation: where: = vector of additive genetic effects for phantom parents;  = vector of additive genetic effects for known animals; [] = matrix that relates parents to progeny; each row contains two non-zero elements (0.5) in the columns pertaining to the sire and dam;  = vector with Mendelian sampling deviations. Rearranging this yields the following result []: That is  the additive genetic merit of all animals can be written as a linear function of the additive genetic effects of phantom parents and Mendelian sampling deviations. Inclusion of genetic groups in the model for genetic evaluation can accommodate for non-zero base population means: where: = incidence matrix relating phantom parents to their respective base population means;  = vector with base population means. In the approach by Robinson [] and Quaas []  the matrix contains one non-zero element in each row  in the column corresponding to the genetic group to which the phantom parent belongs. For the fuzzy classification it is proposed that any row of matrix has all elements equal to 0  except for one  two or more non-zero coefficients (elements defined by 0 =  = 1) such that they add up to 1. For example  if the birth year of a base animal is estimated to be   the phantom parent of this animal can be allocated to genetic groups for birth year    and  with proportions 0.2  0.6 and 0.2. This way it is possible to accommodate for uncertainty about the attributes of the base animal that are used for allocation of its phantom parents to genetic groups. As a consequence of the non-zero base population means  the expectation of the vector with additive genetic effects becomes []: where: Matrix ()relates the breeding values of animals to phantom parents. A single non-zero element in a row represents the expected fraction of the i animal's genes derived from the j phantom parent  and the rows of this matrix sum to one []. Post-multiplication of this matrix with the \"fuzzy\" yields a matrix the rows of which sum to one  for both the distinct and fuzzy classification of genetic groups. Element of  is the expected fraction of the  animal's genes deriving from the  base population. Matrix  can be computed recursively from a list of sires and dams. Element = 0.5(S + D)  where S (or D) is (or )  or the proportion of phantom parent of animal  assigned to group . Consider the example pedigree in Figure . Upper case letters refer to identified animals  and lower case letters to their unknown base parents. The matrices     (relating parents to progeny) and ()(relating animals to phantom parents) for this example pedigree are: . Note that matrix ()represents a block of matrix  that would arise from the  decomposition (where  is a diagonal matrix and  a lower triangular matrix; []) of the relationship matrix for unknown parents a-g and know animals A-F. Suppose that phantom parents can be related to their (three) base groups according to the following matrix: Here  phantom parents a and c came from one group  phantom parent b came from another group  and phantom parent e from a third group. Phantom parents d and f were partly assigned to the second group and the remainder to a third group  and phantom parent f was assigned to all groups  with proportions summing to one. Consequently  Observe that the rows of matrix  sum to one. In the original specification with distinct genetic groups  matrix  would contain sums of powers of 0.5 as elements. In case of fuzzy- classified genetic groups   can essentially contain any value between 0 and 1  depending on the fractions in . The transformed mixed model equations for an animal model with genetic groups derived by Quaas [] are also applicable in the case of fuzzy classification of genetic groups  because the derivation is for any arbitrary matrix . The part on the left hand side is due to relationships: where  is the additive genetic relationships between known animals and   as defined before  relates breeding values of known animals to genetic group effects []. Considering that  = ()() [] and drawing on the definition of  in 2.2  Quaas [] showed that * for a model with genetic groups can be written as: where  is the  row of   is the  diagonal element of    = [ -]  and  = var(f). For animals with known parents  each row of  contains three non-zero elements: a one and two negative halves. For base animals with phantom parents  each row of  usually contains three or more non-zero elements: a 1 and several negative values corresponding to the phantom parents' groups. These elements have a value of -0.5  where is the proportion of phantom parents of  assigned to group . This structure leads directly to an algorithm for forming * that is a simple extension of Henderson's  algorithm. Let () be the number of groups the phantom sire (dam) of  is assigned to  or 1 if the sire (dam) of  is known; () the equation number of the animal's sire (dam) or its group if the sire (dam) is unknown  and x =   then the following contributions need to be added: see table . The rules for creating * resemble those for forming the inverse of an average numerator relationship matrix in case there are a finite number of potential parents (e.g.  [  ] and []). For the example pedigree (Figure )  the contributions for animals A-D to elements of * are in Table . For animals A  D and F there are 9 contributions to *  for animal B and C 16  and for animal E 25. For animal C there are 16 contributions  but only 9 elements of * are affected because the phantom parents of animal C are (in part) assigned to the same group. Observe that the values added to * can become very small if phantom parents are assigned to genetic groups with low proportions  for example 0.04 to element (g  g) for animal B. The complete * for this example is: A population subject to mass selection was simulated for 10 non-overlapping generations  subsequent to a base population of unrelated and non-inbred animals (generation 0). Each generation  50 males and 200 females were randomly mated. Each mating produced two offspring  one of each gender. For each animal a phenotypic record was simulated as the sum of an overall mean  the animal's breeding value and a random residual. An animal's breeding value was generated as the sum of the parent average and a Mendelian sampling deviation that considered inbreeding of the sire and dam. Genetic and residual variances were both 10  yielding a heritability of 0.50. For each replicate  a \"real life\"  incomplete data set for genetic evaluation was created by randomly deleting data. When data were deleted  both phenotypic records and relationship were deleted. The probability of deletion decreased linearly with increasing generation number  and ranged between 0.30 (generation 10) and 0.70 (generation 0). The model for genetic evaluation included an overall mean  random animal effect and genetic groups for phantom parents. The simulated variance components were used to predict breeding values. Solutions to the mixed model equations were obtained using the preconditioned gradient algorithm  which was assumed to be converged when the relative average difference between the right and left hand sides was smaller than 10. Fuzzy classification was compared with distinct classification of genetic groups in two situations: 1) to handle the uncertainty about which group a phantom parent should be assigned to  and 2) to model the average genetic level of unknown parents with a small number of parameters. For the genetic evaluation and forming of genetic groups  uncertainty about the generation of birth was simulated for 25% of the animals with at least one unknown parent. The uncertainty was such that unknown parents could belong to two possible generations: the true generation of birth and the generation prior to that  each with equal probability (0.50). Phantom parents were grouped based on gender and generation number  which resulted in 20 different genetic groups. In the distinct classification  for animals with simulated uncertainty  phantom parents were randomly assigned to just one genetic group  either for the true generation of birth or the generation prior to that  with equal probability. In the fuzzy classification  these phantom parents were assigned to two genetic groups  for both possible generations  with equal proportions (0.50). The simulation was repeated 50 times. For each replicate the empirical mean and variance of prediction errors (true minus predicted breeding value) were computed within generation for animals with simulated uncertainty. In addition  the rankings on predicted breeding values for distinct and fuzzy classification were compared with the rankings on true breeding values. Animals were grouped in deciles based on the predicted and true breeding value  and the percentage of animals classified in the correct decile was determined for animals with and without simulated uncertainty and for animals with both parents known. Two strategies for assigning phantom parents to genetic groups were compared: distinct and fuzzy classification. In the distinct classification  phantom parents were grouped on the basis of gender and generation number  which resulted in 20 different genetic groups. The average number of animals per genetic group was 107 and group size ranged between 59 and 146. In the fuzzy classification there were four groups: two groups for the parent's gender (male  female) and two groups to describe the average genetic level of parents of generation 1 animals and one for parents of generation 10 animals. Phantom parents of animals in intermediate generations were assigned to both groups  with proportions depending on generation number. For example  a phantom sire of an animal born in generation two was assigned with 50% and 0% to the male and female parent genetic group and with 45% to the generation 1 genetic group and with 5% to the generation 10 genetic group  for a phantom dam of an animal born in generation three the proportions were 0%  50  40% and 10%  respectively  etc. This way  the sum of proportions was always equal to 1. The resulting  matrix is not of full rank  meaning that only 3 degrees of freedom are used to model the genetic groups. The simulation was repeated 50 times. For each replicate  the empirical mean and variance of prediction errors (true minus predicted breeding value) were computed within generations  separately for animals with 0  1 or 2 unknown parents. The across-replicate standard deviation of estimates for each genetic group (20 and 3 in case of distinct and fuzzy classification  respectively) was also inspected as an indication of the SE of genetic group solutions. In addition  the across-replicate correlation between genetic group estimates was computed as an indication of sampling correlation of genetic group solutions. The empirical prediction error variance was 1.6% lower (P < 0.05) for animals with simulated uncertainty when genetic groups were fuzzy-classified. For animals with unknown parent groups and for which the generation of birth was accurately known there was no difference in empirical prediction error variance between both grouping strategies. For animals with simulated uncertainty  the percentage of correctly ranked animals was higher (0.7 percent point; Table ). More importantly  accounting for the uncertainty reduced the variation across replicates by more than 10% (Table ). The magnitude of the advantage of fuzzy classification is specific for this simulation design and will vary from case to case  whether it concerns other simulation designs or practical applications. The gains presented here represent a best case scenario  since some aspects of the pattern of uncertainty could be considered in the membership functions. In practical applications this will not be the case and there will be some noise even with fuzzy-classified groups. The empirical prediction error variance was significantly (P < 0.05) lower when genetic groups were fuzzy-classified for animals with one unknown parent (Figure ). The improvement ranged between 0.4% and 1.7%  depending on generation number. The SE of genetic group solutions was approximately 1.8 times lower for fuzzy-classified groups compared to distinct genetic groups. In case of fuzzy classification  much fewer groups (about six times less) were needed to describe the linear pattern of genetic trend of unknown parents  resulting in a higher precision of the genetic group solutions and explaining the lower prediction error variance of breeding values for this alternative.   . The correlation between solutions for genetic groups for phantom sires and dams (for the same generation) was moderately negative (~-0.3) for the distinct classification of genetic groups  but slightly positive (~0.1) when groups were fuzzy-classified (results not shown). This result may explain why the prediction error variance differed between alternatives for animals with one phantom parent  but not for animals with two phantom parents. For an animal with two unknown parents  overestimation of the solution for the genetic group effect for one parent can be compensated by an underestimation of the solution for the genetic group effect for the other parent. When only one parent is unknown such compensation does not occur  and a more precise estimation of the genetic group effects  as in the fuzzy-classified alternative  is favourable. The rules for building the numerator relationship matrix in the case of fuzzy-classified groups are similar to those for building an average numerator relationship for cases where parenthood is uncertain  but limited to a small number of possible parents (see rules in [  ]  and []). The conceptual difference between both procedures is that for the average relationship potential parents are known  whereas in the case of (fuzzy-classified) genetic groups parents are unknown. Incorporation of genetic groups in the genetic evaluation can have a substantial effect on the estimated genetic trend and selection of which parents to breed the next generation of animals (e.g. []). Inclusion of genetic groups may sometimes lead to incorrect ranking of animals and suboptimal selection decisions []. Therefore  for practical applications it is important to evaluate the consequence of different grouping approaches (distinct  fuzzy) and definition of genetic groups (on the basis of birth year  selection path  origin  etc.  or combinations thereof) before deciding which one to adopt. Membership functions should follow the pattern of uncertainty and accurately describe the average genetic level of phantom parents as much as possible. However  consideration should also be given to the precision and the estimability of genetic group effects when determining the proportions with which phantom parents are assigned to genetic groups. For example  very small values are added to the diagonal elements of the mixed model equations for a genetic group to which phantom parents are assigned with small proportions  resulting in a high standard error for that genetic group. Also  to avoid confounding among genetic groups it is necessary to have several combinations of different genetic groups and for the same combination of genetic groups to use several different sets of membership proportions. Therefore  in the evaluation of fuzzy-classified genetic groups it is important to carefully examine the precision of genetic group estimates and possible confounding of genetic groups. A linear trend in the average genetic level of phantom parents was modelled with a low number of parameters (groups) by fuzzy-classification in the simulation. More complex modelling of the average genetic level of phantom parents is possible by means of the fuzzy-classification approach. For example  other factors  like origin and selection path  could be incorporated in a similar way. Pollak EJ  Quaas RL: Definition of group effects in sire evaluation models.

It was concluded that individuals with specific combinations of genotypes at the  QTLs and  QTLs might account for some of the variation typically seen in plots of the association of physical activity with body weight. Mounting evidence suggests that physical activity is crucial for the health and well being of people of all ages  from very young children [] to elderly adults []. Physical inactivity is well known to be associated with a diverse number of health problems such as coronary heart disease and colon cancer [–] and has been ranked as the second leading actual cause of death in the United States []. Sedentary lifestyles also are thought to promote obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes that have become a special concern in recent years because of their dramatic increase in frequency even in children []. Moreover  some studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of physical activity independent of body weight or weight gain []. Given the medical ramifications of obesity  therefore  it is clearly important that we have a better understanding of the association between physical activity and weight. The genetic contribution to the physical activity/body weight relationship is of particular interest  especially because it may account for some of the variability in weight typically observed among individuals with increased levels of physical activity. The question is  do genes or gene interactions with pleiotropic effects on both physical activity and weight traits exist or do these two traits have completely separate genetic bases? At present  we have little information to answer this question and in fact only in recent years has the genetic basis of physical activity itself been seriously explored. To date  various genetic association studies have led to the identification of more than 30 potential candidate genes in humans influencing physical activity traits such as endurance and speed []. However  some of these data are equivocal and it remains to be seen whether the effects of many of these genes on physical activity traits will be verified in subsequent studies and/or whether they also influence body weight. Lightfoot . [] have taken an alternative approach to explore the genetic basis of physical activity by conducting a quantitative trait locus (QTL) study in mice. Using an F population generated from an original cross of two inbred strains differing dramatically in their physical activity levels  these investigators uncovered several different QTLs controlling the distance  duration  and speed voluntarily run by the mice. Most recently  Leamy . [] followed up a QTL analysis with a full-genome scan for epistasis in this same population of mice and discovered a number of epistatic interactions of unknown QTLs that significantly affected the physical activity traits. Contribution of epistasis to the total variation of the traits (average of 26%) was about the same as that for single-locus effects of QTLs  suggesting that epistatic interactions of genes may be an important component of the genetic basis of physical activity []. Although not genetically analyzed  body weights were also recorded for all the F mice  and thus this population presented a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic association between the physical activity traits and weight. We conducted such an investigation in several steps  the first of which was to map direct-effect QTLs for body weight in these mice to determine whether any were at the same location as those affecting the physical activity traits (suggesting common QTLs with pleiotropic effects). A second step was to conduct a genome search for relationship QTLs or  QTLs [  ]  regions in the genome that affect the physical activity traits variably depending on the phenotypic value for body weight. The effects of a  QTL may be visualized by regressions of the dependent variable (physical activity trait) on an independent variable (body weight) that differ for each of several genotypes. For illustrative purposes  Figure  depicts a hypothetical situation where the relationship between a physical activity trait and body weight is positive for one homozygote (designated CC) but negative for the other homozygote (HH) at a  QTL locus. Basically  QTLs produce their effects by interacting with other genes (differential epistasis) or with the environment [  ]. Since epistatic interactions of QTLs were previously found to affect the physical activity traits in these mice []  it seemed reasonable to test for differential epistatic effects as a potential explanation for any  QTLs discovered []. Thus  as a third and final step  we screened the genome to see if  QTLs interacted with other epistatic QTLs ( QTLs) to significantly affect the physical activity traits or body weight. . HH and CC = homozygotes  CH = heterozygotes; note that the effects of different values of body weight are opposing and cancel each other. The F population of mice used in this study was generated from crossing two inbred strains  C57BL/J and C3H/HeJ  previously identified as exhibiting considerable divergence in measures of physical activity. Reciprocal crossing of mice from these strains resulted in 63 F mice that in turn were crossed to produce a total of 310 F offspring (all first litters except for four matings that produced two successive litters). All mice were maintained in the University of North Carolina at Charlotte Vivarium at 18-21°C and 20-40% humidity with 12 h light/dark cycles and with food (Harland Teklad 8604 Rodent Diet  Madison  WI) and water provided . We measured three physical activity traits in all F mice during a 21-day interval starting at an average age of 63 days (9 weeks). These traits included total daily distance (kilometers) and total daily exercise time (minutes) that were recorded every 24 h  and average daily running speed (meters/minute) obtained by dividing distance by duration. This was accomplished for all mice with a solid surface running wheel mounted in their cages that interfaced with a computer that counted the total wheel revolutions and recorded the time each mouse spent exercising (see [] for further details). Within a week after completion of the phenotyping  the mice were sacrificed  weighed to the nearest 0.1 g  and their kidneys were collected for subsequent DNA extraction. Genotyping of all F mice was accomplished for 129 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differed between the C57BL/J and C3H/HeJ  strains. These SNPs were chosen to provide a reasonable coverage of the entire genome (including the X chromosome)  which they did with an average marker-marker interval of about 14 cM. For all mouse procedures  we followed guidelines approved by the UNC Charlotte Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and those recommended for ethical use of animals from the American Physiological Society and the American College of Sports Medicine. As was done previously [] for the three physical activity traits  we first tested body weight (WT) for potential effects due to sex  litter size  and rearing block. All three factors were entered as classification factors in a linear model and found to be statistically significant. WT was therefore adjusted for the effects of these factors by calculating residuals from the model and adding them to the mean weight in the overall population. This procedure was useful in decreasing non-genetic sources of body size variation and therefore presumably increasing the statistical power to detect QTLs and measure their effects. Merging of the adjusted WT values with the previously adjusted values for the physical activity traits constituted the phenotypic data set used in the analyses described below. Direct-effect QTL scans for body weight were carried out using the regression approach to interval mapping [] as previously described for the physical activity traits []. Briefly  additive () and dominance () index values first were assigned for C3H/HeJ homozygotes (HH)  C57L/J homozygotes (CC)  and heterozygotes (CH) at each SNP marker and also imputed for all locations 2 cM apart between flanking markers []. Then  we conducted multiple regression of body weight on these index values at each location to test for QTLs  and if present  estimated their effects by calculation of the additive () and dominance () genotypic values. The  values estimate one-half of the difference between the mean body weights of the two homozygotes and the  values estimate the difference between the mean weight of the heterozygotes and that of the mean of the two homozygotes []. The model was as follows: where µ is a constant   = the residual  and the other terms are as defined above. To test for overall significance at each location  the probabilities generated from the regression analyses were logarithmically transformed to calculate LPR values [(log(1/Prob.)] similar to LOD scores []. The highest LPR score on each chromosome was considered to indicate a putative QTL if this score exceeded a specific threshold value (see below). Confidence intervals for each QTL were determined by the one-LOD rule []. Each chromosome was also tested for two-QTL and sex-specific QTL effects affecting weight in the manner already described []. We used the traditional permutation method of Churchill and Doerge [] with 1000 shuffles to generate specific 5% threshold values for each chromosome that were suggestive of linkage as well as a 5% genome-wise threshold value that offered significant evidence of linkage. The chromosome-wise values were particularly useful in adjusting for the different sampling of each of the chromosomes that varied in length and density of SNP markers. Further  there is only a 5% chance of a false positive QTL for any LPR score exceeding its chromosome-wise threshold. In addition  given that the chromosomes in our F population were in linkage equilibrium  only one false positive might be expected over the entire genome of 20 chromosomes. Thus the use of the chromosome-wise threshold values avoids the vast majority of false positive results while suggesting QTL sites that would not be discovered with the use of the much more stringent genome-wide threshold values that basically are designed to eliminate the possibility of false positive results [  ]. However  as in all QTL studies such as this one  additional studies are invaluable for confirming any putative QTLs identified. To search for relationship QTLs ( QTLs) affecting the association of the physical activity traits with body weight  we used a modification of the regression approach described above. Specifically in these analyses  we regressed the additive and dominance index values  WT  and the  of body weight with the index values on distance  duration  and speed. Essentially this is an analysis of covariance model where the interest is in the interactions []. The model for this approach is represented by the following: where  = the dependent variable and the terms to the right of the operator '|' are partialed out and do not enter into the significance tests and the other terms have been previously defined. Separate analyses were done for the three physical activity traits  and LPR scores were generated as described above and compared to threshold values calculated from permutation procedures run for each trait. Tests for two  QTLs per chromosome as well as sex-specific  QTL effects also were conducted as before. For those  QTLs affecting two or all three physical activity traits but co-localizing in the same or similar positions  it was useful to conduct pleiotropy tests. We used the procedure outlined by Knott and Haley [] to test whether separate  QTLs were potentially a common  QTL with pleiotropic effects on several traits. To implement this procedure  we first calculated residual sums of squares from the canonical correlation runs at the most probable location for the individual activity traits to be tested and pooled them into one matrix. We then ran another canonical correlation procedure for the combined traits to obtain a residual sum of squares matrix at the most probable joint location for a  QTL. The pleiotropy test involved a comparison of the determinants of the two matrices with a likelihood-ratio statistic []. A significant chi-square value in this test suggested that the QTLs were separate whereas a non-significant value suggested that there could be just one QTL with pleiotropic effects on multiple traits. For all  QTLs  we were able to quantify genotype-specific associations of the physical activity traits with body weight. This was done by calculating regressions of the physical activity traits on body weight for the HH  CH  and CC genotypes at the SNP loci closest to the locations of all  QTLs. Testing of these regressions was done via individual -tests evaluated at the conventional 5% significance level. The regressions and their associated coefficient of determination () values were helpful in showing the differences in the associations of the physical activity traits with body weight produced by the three genotypes at each  QTL locus. One way in which  QTLs can affect the relationship between two traits is by epistatically interacting with other QTLs that differentially affect the traits. This phenomenon is called differential epistasis and has been explained in some detail  including with examples  by Cheverud [  ]. Therefore  to examine whether differential epistasis might account for the effects of the  QTLs  we scanned the genome for their epistatic interactions with other QTLs ( QTLs) for the trait or traits (including body weight) specifically affected by each of the  QTLs. The scan was conducted at every location 2 cM apart on all chromosomes (except that of the  QTL) via regression of the trait values on the (fixed) additive and dominance index values for the  QTL (  )  the additive and dominance index values at other locations (  )  and the interactions of the two sets of index values. These interactions generated additive by additive ()  additive by dominance ()  dominance by additive ()  and dominance by dominance () genotypic epistatic components. This model we used was: where the terms and symbols have already been defined. Multivariate regression of the combined effects of the four interaction terms generated a Wilk's lambda statistic with its associated probability that was converted to an LPR value used to test for the significance of overall epistasis. Epistasis was considered present when the highest LPR value on a given chromosome exceeded the appropriate (trait- and chromosome-specific) threshold value previously used in testing for  QTLs. If overall epistasis was indicated  we estimated the four individual epistatic components from the regression model and tested them for significance with conventional -tests. All significant epistatic interactions involving the  QTLs were examined to discover whether they appeared to be acting differentially on the traits. Differential epistasis was assumed to occur for all epistatic interactions affecting only one (activity or weight) trait  but not both traits. In cases where the epistatic interactions were significant for an activity trait and body weight  the direction and magnitude of the four epistatic components for both traits were inspected for potential differences that might indicate differential epistasis. Ideally such comparisons of the epistatic components should be done in a formal statistical test  although past studies have shown that epistatic pleiotropic effects tend to be restricted to single traits [  ]. Additional file  provides basic statistics for all four traits used in the analyses. On average  the F mice weighed about 26 grams and ran over 6 km each day during a 330-minute span that generated a speed of 19 meters per minute. As judged by their coefficients of variation (standard deviation/mean  not shown)  distance and duration are considerably more variable than speed or body weight. The three correlations between each pair of physical activity traits are positive in sign and moderate to high (especially the 0.92 for distance and duration) in magnitude  and all are statistically significant. However body weight shows no significant association with any of these three activity traits. The results of the scan for direct-effect QTLs affecting body weight are shown in Additional file  and are illustrated in Figure  (circles). We have designated each QTL as  followed by its chromosome number and an extension to indicate whether the QTL is the first or second on the chromosome. Seven QTLs were discovered in this scan  including two each on chromosomes 11 and 17. Only the QTL on chromosome 13 () appears to co-localize with any of the QTLs previously discovered for distance  duration  or speed (Figure ). Thus the direct-effect QTLs for body weight appear to be generally distinct from those influencing the physical activity traits in this population of mice. Five QTLs are significant at the experiment-wise level whereas two ( and ) have LPR values that reached chromosome-wise significance. The QTLs contribute individually from 3.3 to 6.3% and collectively 27% (adjusted coefficient of multiple determination from multiple regression) of the total variance of body weight. . Direct-effect QTLs = circles  relationship QTLs = triangles  epistatic QTL = squares  DS = distance  DU = duration  S = speed  and W = body weight. Additive genotypic effects are significant for five body weight QTLs  their absolute values averaging 0.33  or about 1/3 of a standard deviation (Additional file ). The signs of these significant  values are mixed  suggesting that for different QTLs  either the C57L/J (positive values) or C3H/HeJ (negative values) alleles increased body weight. Four QTLs also show significant dominance genotypic values  the average of their absolute values of 0.30 being nearly the same as that for the additive effects. The four significant  values are also positive in sign  indicating that body weight in the CH heterozygotes is greater than that for the average of the two homozygotes. Two QTLs ( and ) exhibit overdominance in which the heterozygote is greater than either homozygote. A total of 19  QTLs were discovered affecting one or more of the three activity traits (Additional file ; Figure   triangles). These  QTLs are located on 15 of the 20 chromosomes  including two each on chromosomes 4  7  8  and X. Three  QTLs (on chromosomes 8  13  and 15) map within the confidence interval for the activity traits or for body weight (Figure ). All LPR scores were significant at the chromosome-wise level  none reaching genome-wise significance. Fifteen of the 19  QTLs affect the relationship between body weight and one of the three physical activity traits  three (    ) affect two traits (distance and duration)  and one  QTL () significantly affects all three traits. Both  QTLs on chromosome X ( and ) are sex-specific  affecting males only; all other  QTLs affect both sexes. Additional file  shows the results of regressions of the physical activity traits on body weight for the three genotypes (HH  CH  and CC) at the SNP marker nearest each of the positions of the 19  QTLs. As may be seen  there is considerable diversity in the patterns of these regressions among the  QTLs. For the HH  CH  and CC genotypes  respectively  there are 11  5  and 11 significant regression coefficients  suggesting that homozygotes tend to show a greater association of the physical activity traits with body weight than do heterozygotes. Judging by the signs of the significant regressions  this association often tends to be positive for the CC (6+  5-) and CH (4+  1-) genotypes but negative for the HH genotype (4+  7-). Regression patterns for the four QTLs affecting more than one trait are similar in all cases. Coefficients of determination ( values) range from 0 to as high as 0.15  and for those associated with significant regressions  average 8%  5%  and 9%  respectively  for the HH  CH  and CC genotypes. The genotype-dependent nature of the regressions of the activity traits on body weight is illustrated in Figure  for three different QTLs. Figures  and  show that the effect of  on the relationship of both distance and duration with body weight is nearly identical (regression of HH positive  CC negative). However   (Figure )  which also affects the duration/body weight relationship  shows quite a different pattern (regression of CC  CH positive  HH negative). Figure  illustrates yet another pattern in which heterozygotes at the  locus show a negative  and homozygotes a positive  association of body weight with speed. . HH = C3H/HeJ homozygotes  CCF = C57/J homozygotes  CH = heterozygotes; plots A and B represent pleiotropic effects of the same relationship QTL on distance and duration; plot C illustrates the effect of a different relationship QTL on duration and plot D illustrates the effect of yet another relationship QTL on speed. Additional file  gives the results of the genome scan for QTLs showing epistasis with each of the  QTLs. Because of the lack of heterozygosity for loci on the X chromosome in males as well as the reduced sample available for male mice  we tested only the 17 autosomal  QTLs for epistasis  eliminating the two male-specific  QTLs on the X chromosome. This scan uncovered a total of 40 significant interactions involving 31  QTLs with all autosomal  QTLs except the two on chromosome 7 ( and ). The LPR value for one epistatic combination   with   reached genome-wide significance whereas all others are significant at the chromosome-wise level only. Seven of the  QTLs interact with more than one  QTL  this being noticeable for  (7  QTLs) and especially for  (9  QTLs). The  QTLs are widely dispersed throughout the genome; all chromosomes except 9 and 13 contain at least one  QTL and two chromosomes  12 and 16  contain three each (Figure   squares). Locations of seven of the 31  QTLs are at or near those for the direct-effect QTLs for weight or the physical activity traits. Also  another nine  QTLs co-localize with  QTLs at identical or very similar positions on these chromosomes (see Figure )  suggesting that these  QTLs in fact are the same as the  QTLs. Of these nine  QTLs  six exhibit reciprocity in the significant epistatic interactions between QTLs seen on chromosomes 3 and 19  4 and 11  and 10 and 15 (for example  note the interactions of  with   and  with  in Additional file ). This provides additional evidence of the commonality of these particular  QTLs with the  QTLs. With regard to the traits involved in epistasis  seven of the 17 autosomal  QTLs exhibited epistatic interactions with 11 different  QTLs that significantly affected body weight. Although distance and duration are highly correlated  significant epistatic interactions were much more prevalent for duration (five  QTLs with 13  QTLs) than for distance (three  QTLs with five  QTLs).  had a particularly strong effect on duration through its interactions with six other  QTLs. The number of epistatic interactions affecting speed is similar to that for duration  involving six  QTLs and 10  QTLs. Clearly  epistatic effects are acting differentially because all 17  QTLs affecting a specific activity trait (Additional file ) exert epistatic effects only on that trait or on body weight  not both. This suggests that differential epistasis can account for the variation among the genotype-specific associations of the activity traits and body weight exhibited by the  QTLs (Additional file ). Two examples of the epistatic interactions of  QTLs and  QTLs are illustrated in Figure . Each example includes a bar diagram that shows the epistatic effects of the two QTLs on the physical activity trait significantly affected  and two additional line plots that illustrate the effect on the variance (arrows) of both the affected physical activity trait and on body weight from the perspective of the  QTL. In the first panel in Figure   note the increase in duration from the HH to the CC genotype at the  locus  but only when another epistatic locus on chromosome 1 () is homozygous  not heterozygous. This epistasis is also seen in the second plot where the lines connecting each of the genotypes are not parallel. The second plot also shows that the variance of duration is greatest for the HH compared to the CH or CC genotypes at the  QTL locus. Body weight was not significantly affected by the interactions of this QTL pair  and this is reflected in the roughly parallel lines in the third plot (Figure ) and also the more uniform variances throughout the genotypes. Figure  shows that  affects speed and exhibits underdominance when associated with HH or CH genotypes  but overdominance when associated with the CC genotype  at another QTL on chromosome 6. Note again the lack of parallel lines for speed in the second plot but the roughly parallel lines for body weight. In both examples  therefore  epistasis affects the physical activity trait differently from body weight  illustrating differential epistasis. . Each example includes a bar diagram that shows the epistatic effects of two QTLs on the physical activity trait significantly affected  and two additional line plots that illustrate the effect on the variance (arrows) of both the affected physical activity trait and on body weight from the perspective of the  QTL; note that the physical activity trait is more affected than weight  illustrating differential epistasis. The purpose of this study was to test for a genetic (pleiotropic) association between the three physical activity traits and body weight in an F population of mice. To this end  first we mapped body weight QTLs to see whether they might be located near some of the QTLs for the physical activity traits previously mapped []. As will be recalled  only one of the seven body weight QTLs () co-localized with a QTL affecting the activity traits. Thus at least in this population of mice  it seems clear that the direct-effect QTLs for the physical activity traits are largely independent from those for body weight. However  this conclusion holds only for body weight at the age (average of 12 weeks) the mice were measured and may not be true for weight at other ages. The number of body weight QTLs we discovered was necessarily limited  however  because the inbred progenitors for this particular population were selected on the basis of their divergence in physical activity traits  not body weight. Many more QTLs for body weight measured at various ages have been identified in other populations of mice [–]. So we may eventually find that some of these body weight QTLs also exert pleiotropic effects on physical activity traits. The search for QTLs that indirectly affected the physical activity traits via their relationship with body weight was quite successful  uncovering 19 different  QTLs spread throughout the genome. At least 15 (79%) of these  QTLs appeared to be distinct from the direct-effect QTLs for the activity traits [] or for body weight (presented above). This proportion of independent  QTLs is similar to that of 70% (16 of 23) discovered by Cheverud . [] for a number of mouse mandibular traits with overall mandible length  but is considerably higher than that of 27% (3 of 11) found by Pavlicev . [] affecting the association between limb bone lengths and body weight in an intercross population of mice. Pavlicev . [] suggested that since their progenitor strains had been created by selection for large (LG/J) and for small (SM/J) body weights  this may have increased the chance of detecting body weight QTLs that also pleiotropically influenced limb bone lengths. The progenitor strains used to generate our intercross population did not have this history of selection  so perhaps our choice of strains and the traits we measured accounted for the high proportion of independent  QTLs we found. Whatever the case  the 15  QTLs were concealed in the original scans for direct-effect QTLs because of their opposing effects in mice with large versus small body weights. Their discovery substantially increases the total number of QTLs known to affect the physical activity traits in this population of mice. Given the initial calculation of the near zero  non-significant phenotypic correlations of body weight with each of the physical activity traits in the total population  it was interesting to see what patterns of genotypic-specific regressions the  QTLs might exhibit. In principle the overall phenotypic independence of body weight from the activity traits could be achieved with some  QTLs showing all positive  and some all negative  regressions (although of different magnitudes for the three genotypes). However  instead  each of the  QTLs had at least one genotype that showed a positive  and one a negative  regression of the activity trait or traits on weight  so body weight showed overall independence at each of these loci. Many (42 of 72) of these regressions actually were not significant  and although this may be partly a consequence of limited statistical power especially for the homozygotes that had lower sample sizes  it is another indication of the general independence of body weight from the activity traits. In contrast  all 75 regressions of limb lengths on body weight calculated by Pavlicev .[] for each of three genotypes at the  QTLs they discovered were significant. In addition  the coefficients of determination they calculated averaged 0.23  much higher than that of 0.07 for the significant regressions for the physical activity traits (Additional file ). Not surprisingly  body weight clearly has a greater association with limb lengths [  ] than with the physical activity traits we measured in this specific population of mice. Among the  QTLs  there was no consistent pattern as to which genotype produced a positive  zero  or negative association of the physical activity traits with body weight. There were a few trends previously detailed such as the heterozygotes showing the fewest number of significant regressions  but the effect of a particular genotype at a  QTL on the activity/weight association could not be predicted. However  within those  QTLs that affected the association of body weight with more than one of the physical activity traits  the pattern of genotype-specific regressions was consistent across the traits. As an example  for  the HH and CH genotypes produced positive  and the CC genotype negative  regressions for duration  distance  and speed (Additional file ). These types of consistent pleiotropic effects produce positive genetic covariances that are compatible with the moderate to high phenotypic correlations among the activity traits. Similar patterns of variability in regressions among  QTLs but consistency within  QTLs were found by Pavlicev . []  so may be generally expected in future studies designed to search for  QTLs. The discovery of the  QTLs in this population of mice is of evolutionary interest because it shows that there is genetic variation in their pleiotropic effects on body weight and the physical activity traits upon which natural selection can act. From the various regression patterns exhibited by the  QTLs  it can be predicted that selection for a particular activity trait such as speed would favor different genotypes with different body weights (Additional file   Figure ). Furthermore  since body weight itself changes  this can result in an increase in the difference among genotypic values of traits affected by these loci  and thus in increases in their variability []. Selection favoring genotypes with non-significant (zero) slopes (Additional file ) could lead to a complete loss of association of body weight with physical activity. We discovered 40 significant interactions of the  QTLs with 31 separate epistatic QTLs that influenced the physical activity traits and body weight. These numbers are quite comparable to the 40 epistatic interactions involving 33  QTLs found by Pavlicev . [] in their analysis of the association of limb bone lengths with body weight in an entirely different population of mice. In our epistasis scan   alone accounted for 11 of the 40 significant interactions so it appears to be a particularly important  QTL. It will be recalled that this  QTL was the only one discovered that significantly affected the relationship of body weight with all three physical activity traits (Additional file ). Another  QTL    interacted with seven different  QTLs  affecting duration in six of these cases. Therefore  of the 13 epistatic interactions affecting duration  about half involved just this one  QTL. However  with regard to multiple interactions  these two  QTLs were exceptions because all other  QTLs typically interacted with only one or two (or at the most  three)  QTLs. Each of the interactions significantly affected either a physical activity trait or body weight  but not both  suggesting differential epistasis. In most (28) of the interactions a physical activity trait rather than body weight was affected even though weight was involved in the effects produced by all  QTLs. Wolf . [] have also found that the majority of epistatic effects on early- and late-developing skull traits in a population of mice were restricted to single traits  so epistasis may often act in a differential fashion. In any event  differential epistasis appears to satisfactorily account for variation in the genotype-specific associations of the physical activity traits with body weight for each of the  QTLs we discovered. As explained earlier  epistatic interactions involving the  QTLs that produce significant changes for each genotype in the variances of one trait but not the other produce differences in the relationships of these traits as we have documented with regressions. Although 31  QTLs were found in the epistasis scans  it is clear that many of them are not unique. As previously detailed  as many as 10 of the  QTLs map near  QTLs and another seven map near direct-effect QTLs for the physical activity traits or for body weight (Figure ). This suggests that at most 14 of the  QTLs  or less than half of those discovered  appear to be independent from the  QTLs or direct-effect QTLs. It is also possible that some of the epistatic pairs of QTLs we found may be the same as those previously discovered by Leamy . [] in their genome scan for epistatic interactions affecting the three physical activity traits in this same population of mice. Therefore  we reviewed those interactions listed as significant at the 0.001 level for each of these traits given in Leamy . ([]; Additional files     ) to see whether any matched our results (Additional file ). None of the 10 interactions for distance or the 12 interactions for duration given by Leamy .[] was the same as those we discovered in this study. For speed  however  five of the eight previously found to be significant appear to be the same as five of our interactions  including  QTLs on chromosomes 10  11 (perhaps the same as )  12  18 and 19. It is not at all clear why some of the previous interactions found for speed but not distance or duration match those we found  but it emphasizes the difference between our scan that searched for interactions with each of the  QTLs compared to the scan done previously for every two locus combination on each pair of chromosomes. Clearly  it seems that the QTLs we have uncovered act directly  indirectly  or in both ways on the activity and weight traits. We have classified them into three categories (direct-effect QTLs   QTLs  and  QTLs) based on the approach we used for their discovery. However  beyond this approach  this distinction may be arbitrary since a direct-effect QTL in one population could well turn out to be a  QTL or an  QTL in another population. All such QTLs collectively contribute to the phenotypic values and variability of the activity and weight traits  suggesting a complex genetic basis for these traits. Although the  QTLs (and  QTLs) we have found provide approximate locations throughout the genome for genes that affect the physical activity traits via their association with body weight  the identity of these genes is presently entirely unknown. Hundreds of potential candidate genes lie within the confidence intervals of many of these QTLs  so it would seem presumptuous to attempt to list possible candidates for them. Some consideration of potential candidate genes seems warranted  however  for one specific  QTL:  exhibited the highest LPR value that in fact nearly reached genome-wise significance  and in addition  this  QTL showed the greatest number of significant epistatic interactions (recall Additional file  results). Therefore  we searched the Mouse Genome Informatics database [] for potential candidate genes in the area of this  QTL. However  the possibilities listed below are only meant to be illustrative and in no way are exhaustive. For   one potential candidate gene is   immunoglobulin mu binding protein-2 (chromosome 19  0 cM). This gene affects the cardiovascular and muscle systems as well as growth  and is apparently essential for cardiomyocyte maintenance necessary to meet respiratory demands []. Another possibility is   Scy1-like 1(chromosome 19  6 cM)  that affects muscle tone  behavior  growth/size  and the nervous system []. A third and perhaps most interesting potential candidate gene is   actinin alpha 3 (chromosome 19  3 cM). In humans  a nonsense polymorphism at this locus is quite common and is associated with reduced muscle strength and sprint performance [  ]. In mice  knockouts exhibit reduced force generation  apparently because of a shift from the properties of fast muscle fibers to those of slow muscle fibers []. Interestingly  an isoform of   actinin alpha 2 ( on chromosome 13  7 cM) that has similar physiological functioning as   is located near the significant single-effect QTLs for the physical activity traits (  11 cM;   11 cM;   9 cM) we discovered earlier []. These few examples provide some insight into the range of genes that might affect the relationship between physical activity and body weight. They also illustrate the complexity of this relationship and how difficult it is to even know which systems (nervous  muscular  cardiovascular  endocrine  etc.) may be involved. However  some recent studies by Good and colleagues [–] provide clear evidence of one example in which the nervous and endocrine systems are involved in the linkage between body weight with physical activity. Good . [] have shown that   nescient helix loop helix 2  is expressed in neuroendocrine tissues such as the pituitary and hypothalamus and acts to reduce physical activity in mice that eventually leads to adult-onset obesity.  may exert its effects by regulating the motivation for voluntary physical activity  but whatever the actual pathway  this gene clearly produces a negative association between activity and body weight.  is located on chromosome 3  although not in the area of the  QTL () that we discovered on this chromosome. We discovered a number of  QTLs in our population of mice that provided evidence for a genetic association of physical activity and body weight. Genotypes at these loci exhibited variously positive  zero  and negative activity/weight associations  and their individual and collective net effect produced overall independence of body weight from physical activity. However  even where plots of physical activity versus body weight show no association  some of the variability we typically see in such plots may be due to unique combinations of genotypes carried by individuals at their  QTLs. Since we have seen that the  QTLs appear to be generated from differential epistatic effects  it may prove very difficult to predict the level of physical activity an individual with a specific body weight might voluntarily achieve. Our discovery of  QTLs in this population of mice also suggests that the genetic architecture of physical activity and its relationship to body weight may turn out to be even more complex than we had imagined.

In animal and plant breeding  however  mating is often not random. A particular form of nonrandom mating occurs when parental individuals of opposite sex originate from distinct populations. In animal breeding this is called  and  in plant breeding. In these situations  association between marker and putative gene alleles might differ between the founding populations and origin of alleles should be accounted for in studies which estimate breeding values with marker data. The sequence of alleles from one parent constitutes one haplotype of an individual. Haplotypes thus reveal allele origin in data of crossbred individuals. We introduce a new method for haplotype inference without pedigree that allows nonrandom mating and that can use genotype data of the parental populations and of a crossbred population. The aim of the method is to estimate line origin of alleles. The method has a Bayesian set up with a Dirichlet Process as prior for the haplotypes in the two parental populations. The basic idea is that only a subset of the complete set of possible haplotypes is present in the population. Line origin of approximately 95% of the alleles at heterozygous sites was assessed correctly in both simulated and real data. Comparing accuracy of haplotype frequencies inferred with the new algorithm to the accuracy of haplotype frequencies inferred with PHASE  an existing algorithm for haplotype inference  showed that the DP algorithm outperformed PHASE in situations of crossbreeding and that PHASE performed better in situations of random mating. In general  marker genotypes of polyploid organisms are   i.e. it is unknown to which of the two homologous chromosomes each allele at each marker belongs. The sequence of alleles at adjacent markers on one chromosome is called a ; in diploid organisms a genotype consists of two haplotypes. Haplotypes provide information about the cosegregation of chromosomal segments and can be used to identify relatives when pedigree information is unknown. The haplotypes that an individual carries can be determined experimentally but this is expensive []. Alternatively  haplotypes can be inferred  either with or without pedigree information. When pedigree information is available  haplotypes can be inferred using genotype data of relatives (e.g. [  ]). When pedigree information is not available  haplotypes can be inferred from genotype data of the population (e.g. [    –]). Stephens et al. [] used a Bayesian model to obtain a posterior distribution of haplotypes. Their prior distribution for haplotypes approximates a coancestry model by which distinct haplotypes originate from one common haplotype and can differ due to mutations at specific locations. Due to this prior  new haplotypes are likely to be equal or similar to haplotypes that already have been inferred. Stephens and Sheet [] extended the prior in [] with a recombination model which explicitly accounts for linkage of loci on the genome. The whole algorithm is implemented in the program PHASE. The model of Xing et al. [] is comparable to the model of Stephens et al. [] in assuming that haplotypes in the population originate from a latent set of ancestral haplotypes. This model uses a Dirichlet Process as prior for the ancestral haplotypes in the population and distinct haplotypes in the population can be associated to one ancestral haplotype due to a mutation rate. Mentioned methods assume a random mating population where the probability of an ordered genotype is the product of the population frequencies of the two contributing haplotypes []. Random mating  however  is rarely accomplished in reality. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium that lead to increased heterozygosity complicate haplotype inference  whereas departures that lead to increased homozygosity make haplotype inference easier []. A common case of nonrandom mating occurs when parental individuals of opposite sex originate from divergent populations. In animal breeding this is referred to as  and in plant breeding as . In these applications  selection takes place in the purebred population and crossed offspring are used for production purposes. This allows the breeder to exploit heterosis and reduces the risk of sharing improved genetic material with competitors. Pedigree of crossed individuals is generally not recorded in commercial animal production situations because of logistics and costs []. Because of nonrandom mating  haplotypes of commercial crossed individuals can generally not be inferred with the use of existing methods for haplotype inference without pedigree. During recent years  use of marker information for estimation of breeding values has received ample attention (e. g. [      –]). In general  methods for estimating breeding values with marker data estimate effects the alleles of markers in the data with a specific regression technique and use these effects to calculate breeding values of selection candidates. Direct application of methods for estimating breeding values in crossbreeding situation can be problematic when association phase between markers and QTL differ in the two parental lines  which is increasingly likely when the distance between markers and QTL increases. A secure approach is therefore to estimate separate marker effects for each purebred population separately; this requires knowledge of the line origin of alleles. Line origin of alleles can be estimated with the use of pedigree information. If pedigree information is not available  line origin of alleles can be estimated based on allele frequencies in the purebred populations  or alternatively  based on haplotype frequencies in the purebred populations. Use of haplotype frequencies can be advantageous to reveal line origin of allele when differences between allele frequencies in both lines are relatively small. In this article  we introduce a new method for inferring haplotypes in crossbred situations without pedigree information. The method uses marker information from the two parental populations and from the crossbred offspring population. Joint inference of haplotypes is expected to increase accuracy of haplotypes inferred for the three populations. The main objective of our method  however  was to estimate line origin of marker alleles in the crossbred population. The method uses an approach similar to the approach used by Xing et al. []. The method can be applied to infer haplotypes and estimate line origin of alleles in crossbred data and to infer haplotypes in purebred data. Throughout this paper  we refer to the method as  because the algorithm uses a Dirichlet Process as prior distribution for the haplotype frequencies in the parental populations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We begin by describing the DP algorithm  followed by describing the data which we used for evaluating the method. We proceed by describing the results obtained with the method and compare these to results obtained with PHASE []. We finish the paper with a discussion section. In this section we introduce the DP algorithm for haplotype inference. First  we introduce the concepts involved in the method. Then  we proceed with the details of the method starting with a model for a random mating situation followed by an extension of this model to a situation of crossbreeding. For the implementation of the method  a user can either assume random mating or crossbreeding. We finish the section by describing the evaluation of the method and the data employed in this evaluation. The DP algorithm is programmed in R [] and available as an R-package upon request from the authors. Consider a list of genotypes  of  biallelic loci. The genotype of individual     consists of two unknown haplotypes: the haplotype that the individual received from its mother    and the haplotype that it received from its father  . The pair of haplotypes that the individual carries is one of the 2possible haplotype pairs. The probability for each pair is a function of the unknown population frequencies of the two haplotypes. Imagine that all haplotypes in a population are represented in a list of haplotype classes    and that a haplotype is identical to the class to which it is associated. Let represent the class in  to which haplotype  of individual  is associated. The associations of all haplotypes in the data to classes in  are in matrix . The frequency of a class is the number of haplotypes that are associated to that class. When genotypes are unordered  neither  nor  are known. In our method  we need to simultaneously infer the haplotype pair that correspond to a genotype because one haplotype that corresponds to a genotype completely determines the other haplotype corresponding to that genotype. The length of list  represents the haplotype count in the population. When  is the number of genotyped individuals and for  is greater than 0  this count ranges from 1 to 2. Similar as Xing et al. []  we formulate the distribution of haplotypes in the population as a mixture model. The mixture components are the elements of . The mixture proportion of a class is proportional to its frequency  which is an estimate of the frequency of that haplotype class in the population. We specify a Bayesian model where inference is based on the posterior probabilities of the parameters. The posterior probability of the unknown parameters of our model    and   is (  ). Using Bayes' theorem: The likelihood of the genotypes given the parameters is (|). The prior is (  ). We use Gibbs sampling to obtain samples from the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters. For Gibbs sampling  we only need the posterior distribution until proportionality and the normalizing constant () is not required. In the following  we describe the likelihood function and the prior distribution for the haplotype classes and the correspondence parameters. We then combine the likelihood and prior and describe our Gibbs sampler. The following model specifies the likelihood function of our model by describing the relation between genotype  and the pair of haplotypes (  ): Parameter  is an error rate between genotype  and pair of haplotypes (  ). Indicator (== + ) has value 1 when the two alleles at locus  match with the genotype on locus  and 0 otherwise. Indicator (<U+2260> + ) has value 1 when the two haplotypes do not match with the genotype and 0 otherwise. Because we do not allow for errors   = 1 is in our model. The probability in model 2 is different from 0 only when a pair of haplotypes matches with the genotype on all loci. We know that we have a large number  of possible haplotype classes (for biallelic loci   = 2). For haplotype  of individual     parameter indicates to which class that haplotype is associated. Index   ()) indicates if the haplotype originated from the mother or from the father of individual . For each class   parameter describes the distribution of observations associated to that class and  represents all []. For each class  this distribution only consists of haplotypes that are identical to that class because we do not allow for errors between a haplotype and the class to which that haplotype is associated. The are sampled from the base distribution of the Dirichlet Process   []  which in our case is a distribution the  possible haplotype classes. The mixing proportions for the classes    have a symmetric Dirichlet prior distribution with concentration parameter / []. Following Neal []  this gives: The first equation of expression 3 is the distribution of haplotype given parameter and . The second equation is the prior distribution for = . The third equation is the base distribution of the model and the fourth equation is the prior for the mixing proportions. After integration over   the prior for =  is []: where  is the frequency of haplotype class and represents the number of haplotypes associated to this class excluding current haplotype . is the number of haplotypes excluding haplotype   i.e. . The first equation is the prior probability of sampling  class . The second equation is the prior probability of sampling a  class  i.e. the haplotype is not associated to any haplotype class that is already present in list . We modify distribution 3 to evaluate the prior probability of a pair of haplotypes. Here  we integrate the prior for   | over   because the association of a pair of haplotypes to classes in  is unknown. Each haplotype is either associated to an existing class in  or to a new class which is not in . Five situations can then occur:  Both haplotypes are associated to a different class in ;  Both haplotypes are associated to the same class in ;  One haplotype is associated to a class in  and the other haplotype is associated to a class which not in ;  Both haplotypes are associated to different haplotype classes which are not in ;  Both haplotypes are associated to the same class which is not in . It can be shown that integration over  gives the following prior probabilities for these five situations: Here   represents the number of haplotypes associated to class   excluding the two haplotypes corresponding to genotype . The total number of haplotypes sampled excluding the two haplotypes is ; . We use a Gibbs sampler to obtain samples from the posterior distribution (  |  ). We follow algorithm 1 of Neal [] to derive the posterior probabilities corresponding to the five situations described in the previous: The sums in expression 6 can be simplified.  only if is compatible with the genotype  i.e. (|=   ) = 1. Otherwise it is 0 because one haplotype and a genotype completely determines the second haplotype. To evaluate the sums in the fourth and fifth equation  let  be the number of heterozygous loci on the genotype. If  > 0    otherwise it is 0. If  = 0    otherwise it is 0. Now  conditional expression 6 for the five situations is: We extend the model to a crossbreeding situation. In this situation  we consider three populations. Populations M and F are the purebred parental populations. Population Cross is the crossbred offspring population  created by crossing individuals from population M to individuals of population F. Let denote the list of haplotype classes for population M and denote the list of haplotype classes for population F. In crossbred individuals  one haplotype originates from population M and the other haplotype originates from population F  and haplotypes inferred for a crossbred genotype thus estimate origin of heterozygous alleles of that genotype. Both haplotypes in a purebred individual from population M or F originate from that population. Figure  graphically represents this crossbreeding situation with the two list of haplotype classes. Posterior probabilities for sampling haplotype pairs for purebred individuals in population M and F are in expression 7. A different posterior probability is required for sampling a haplotype pair for a crossbred individual. . represents the list of haplotype classes of population M and represents the list of haplotype classes of population F. represents the genotypes in population M  represents the genotypes in population F  and represents the genotypes in the crossbred population Cross. Haplotypes for are associated to classes in and . Haplotype of a crossbred individual is associated to a class in and haplotype is associated to a class in . Three situations can occur at the moment of sampling a haplotype pair for a crossbred individual at a given step in the sampling algorithm.  Haplotype is associated to a class in and haplotype is associated to a class in .  One haplotype is associated to a class in . and the other haplotype is associated to a class not in the other list of haplotype classes.  Both haplotypes are associated to classes which are not in the lists. The prior probabilities corresponding to these situations are: The rationale for obtaining posterior probabilities is identical to the single population case. Consequently  the posterior probability for the three situations is: The goal of our algorithm was to accurately identify line origin of alleles at heterozygous sites in crossbred individuals. For this purpose  the algorithm infers haplotypes for both the purebred and crossbred individuals in the data. Line origin accuracy of alleles at heterozygous sites in crossbred individuals was assessed using the measure  ().  could only be assessed for crossbred individual because all alleles in a purebred individual originate from a single line or population.  was calculated as the number of alleles at heterozygous sites whose origin is correctly estimated and is expressed as fraction of the total number of heterozygous loci in that individual.  ranges between 0  when origin of all alleles is inferred incorrectly to 1  when origin of all alleles at heterozygous sites is inferred correctly. For the purpose of estimating allele origin  the algorithm estimates frequencies of haplotype classes in the distinct populations. We used a second measure of algorithm performance to assess the accuracy of inferred haplotype frequencies. Following the article of Excoffier and Slatkin []  we used     for this purpose.  assesses similarity between the vector of  and estimated haplotype frequencies.  was calculated as []: where the summation is over the 2possible haplotypes in the population   is the estimated frequency of haplotype  and is the true frequency of this haplotype. We compared  of haplotype frequencies inferred with the DP algorithm to  of haplotype frequencies inferred with PHASE []. We ran PHASE for 1 000 iterations  with a burn-in of 100 iterations and a thinning period of 10 samples  which is the default used by PHASE.  could not be compared between the two methods because PHASE assumes single  random mating populations. Indices  and  were recorded each 50sample of the MCMC chain and averaged over the whole length of the chain to obtain the mean of their posterior distributions. The length of the chain was made dependent on the number of genotypes in the data. For the simulated data  the chain was run for 20 000 iterations when single populations were assumed and for 40 000 iterations when a crossbreeding scheme was assumed. The chain was run for 100 000 iterations for the data of the Wageningen Meishan cross (see below). The first 5 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. The number of iterations was determined after visual inspection of parameters  and   which stabilized after approximately 10 000 iterations. We used two datasets to evaluate the algorithm. Two independent populations were simulated (population M and population F). Genomes consisted of one single chromosome of a length of 9 cM with 10 biallelic markers equally distributed over the chromosome. In the base populations  Minor Allele frequencies (MAF) were equal for all markers. In population M  the 1 allele was the minor allele and the 0 allele was the minor allele in population F. For populations M and F  100 generations of random mating were simulated maintaining a population size of 100 to establish Linkage Disequibrium between markers. Recombinations were simulated according to the genetic distance and without interference. A hundred crossed individuals were simulated by crossing generation 100 of population M to generation 100 of population F. Minor Allele Frequency in the simulated base population was varied between 0.01  0.25  0.40  and 0.49 to create a range of situations. In the MAF is 0.49 situation  populations were highly similar  and populations were extremely different in the MAF is 0.01 situation. Ten replicates were simulated for each MAF value. The second dataset was SNP data of the Wageningen Meishan-commercial line cross and consisted of 294 genotyped crossbred F1 offspring individuals  109 genotyped dams from commercial lines  and 19 genotyped sires from the Meishan breed. The genotypes consisted of 14 SNP loci covering approximately 5 cM on chromosome 2. Genotype data of the parental lines (commercial dams and Meishan sires) and genotypes of the crossbred F1 offspring were used for analyses. Haplotypes were previously inferred using the known pedigree with the program CVM (which stands for Cluster Variation Method) []. The program CVM is an algorithm for inferring haplotypes from unordered genotype data conditioning on marker information of relatives  identified through pedigree information. Haplotypes inferred with CVM were considered as correct and haplotypes inferred with DP were compared with these. In the first part of this section  we validate the algorithm using the simulated data. In the second part  we use the algorithm to estimate haplotypes in the real Wageningen-Meishan cross data. For each dataset  we compare the performance of the DP algorithm with the performance of PHASE. Table  summarizes the simulated populations. Heterozygosity and the count of distinct haplotypes in the parental population increased when MAF in the base population of M and F increased because MAF was set for reciprocal alleles in the two populations. Chromosome size was equal in all simulations but the number of observable recombinations in the crossbred population increased when MAF of the base population increased because the probability that a haplotype originating from a recombination was already present in the population decreased with increasing heterozygosity. The number of haplotype classes increased when concentration parameter  of the Dirichlet Process increased (Table ). There was only a small effect of parameter  on  of the parental and crossbred populations. Crossbreeding was assumed in these analyses  enabling to calculate  for the crossbred population  but the effect of  on  was only minimal (Table ). Accuracy of estimated haplotype frequencies in the crossbred population was affected by assuming random mating or crossbreeding. When random mating was (erroneously) assumed  there was only 30% agreement between the estimated and true vector of haplotype frequencies in the crossbred population  reflected by  (Table ).  increased to 0.87 when crossbreeding was assumed and marker data of the parental populations was included in the analyses (Table ). Average  of haplotype frequencies estimated for the parental M population increased from 0.84 when random mating was assumed to 0.88 when crossbreeding was assumed (Table ). Allele Origin Accuracy was only calculated for crossbred individuals when crossbreeding was assumed. In this case   was 0.95  reflecting that the origin of 95% of the alleles at heterozygous sites in crossbred individuals was correctly assessed. Including marker data of at least one parental population was crucial for  and  of haplotypes inferred for crossbred individuals (Table ). A lower improvement was achieved due to including the second population in the analyses. Similarity Index and  of haplotypes inferred for crossbred individuals with DP increased when MAF of the parental populations were increasingly different (Table ). In contrast   of haplotypes inferred for the same data with PHASE decreased when differences between MAF of parental populations increased (Table ).  of haplotypes inferred for purebred individuals were similar between DP and PHASE. The crossbred individuals in the Wageningen Meishan-Commercial cross data originated from 19 sires and 109 dams. Three analyses were performed using data of 19  63 and 109 dams and only their offspring and the sires of these offspring in the analyses. Data were analysed using the DP algorithm assuming crossbreeding  using the DP algorithm assuming random mating and using PHASE  which assumes random mating. Similarity Indices obtained using the DP algorithm were substantially higher when crossbreeding was assumed compared to when random mating was assumed (Table ). Similarity indices obtained with PHASE were very similar to  obtained with DP assuming crossbreeding  despite that PHASE assumed random mating. There was not a clear effect of the number of dams used on . Allele origin accuracies obtained with DP when crossbreeding was assumed were approximately 0.95  without regard of the number of dams included in the data (Table ). Crossbreeding or hybridisation is a common case of nonrandom mating in animal and in plant breeding. Inference of haplotypes in crossbred individuals is useful when line origin of alleles is required because haplotypes provide information about cosegregation of chromosome segments. In this paper  we introduced and validated a method for estimating line origin of alleles in crossbred individuals when pedigree information is unknown. To our knowledge  no algorithms for estimating line origin of alleles in crossbred individuals have been described. Comparison of results obtained with the DP algorithm to results obtained with alternative methods was therefore not possible. For comparison  we concentrated on the accuracy of haplotype frequencies  as indexed by parameter Similarity Index   and compared  obtained using the DP algorithm to  obtained using PHASE. PHASE was used to compare results obtained with the DP algorithm because PHASE was used in several recent studies (e.g. [–]). The prior distribution for haplotypes used in PHASE is more realistic than that used in the DP algorithm. The prior distribution in the DP algorithm assigns equal probability to all classes from the 2possible haplotypes. The prior distribution in PHASE approximates a coancestry model of the haplotypes and explicitly models linkage between markers [  ]. Haplotypes inferred with PHASE for the Wageningen Meishan-Commercial cross data reflect the qualities of PHASE (Table ). In the situations which were simulated  however  haplotypes for crossbred individuals inferred with PHASE were less accurate than haplotypes inferred with DP. Complexity of haplotype inference is determined by the number of heterozygous loci in a genotype because the number of possible haplotype configurations is 2. By design of the simulations  heterozygosity in the crossbred populations was high when heterozygosity in the parental populations was low (Table ). Consequently   of haplotype frequencies inferred with PHASE where low for the crossbred populations and high for the parental populations in these scenarios (Table ). In contrast to PHASE  the DP algorithm uses information from the two parental populations to infer haplotypes in the crossbred population. Advantage of this approach was most apparent in situations when  of haplotypes inferred with PHASE for crossbred individuals were lowest. Line origin of approximately 95% of the alleles at heterozygous sites in crossbred individuals was correctly identified by the algorithm when genotypes of parental individuals were included in the analyses. Excluding genotypes of either one or both parental populations from the analyses showed that including data of at least one parental population was crucial for correct identification of line origin of alleles (Table ). In the current DP algorithm  the prior distribution for haplotype classes does not account for allele frequencies in each population. Clustering haplotypes based on allele frequencies  following Huelsenbeck and Andolfatto []  could improve the accuracy of the DP algorithm for crossbred individuals  especially in situations when few data on the parental populations are available. In addition  it could facilitate extension of the algorithm to situations where the data originated from more than two parental populations. Currently  the algorithm can not easily be extended to more than two population because of the large number of possible haplotype configurations which would need to be evaluated for this because each haplotype could originate from all populations. The DP algorithm is similar to the algorithm of Xing et al. [] because it assumes the existence of a limited number of classes for the haplotypes in the population and uses a Dirichlet Process as prior distribution for these classes. A feature of the Dirichlet Process is that it clusters data without the need to specify the number of clusters. In the context of haplotypes  this feature is especially attractive because the haplotype diversity in the population usually is lower than the 2possible haplotype classes ( is the number of polymorphic loci in the data). Apart from the ability to infer haplotypes in a situation of crossbreeding  the most important difference between our model and that of Xing et al. [] is that our model does not assume errors between a haplotype and the class to which it is associated nor between a pair of haplotypes and the genotype to which they correspond. The first consequence of this is that we need to update the pair of haplotypes corresponding to a genotype simultaneously because the haplotypes corresponding to a genotype are conditionally dependent. The second consequence is that the number of haplotype classes required for a population is equal or larger than in the model of Xing et al. []. Not not allowing for errors had several benefits. Implementation of the model of Xing et al. [] showed that controlling the error rate through the hyperparameters of their model was very difficult. Errors were either sampled between haplotypes and their classes or between haplotypes and the genotypes to which they corresponded. Not allowing for errors between haplotypes and genotypes made simultaneously updating the pair of haplotype corresponding to a genotype necessary. For simultaneous updating  however  all pairs of haplotypes that are possible for a genotype need to be considered in each sampling step of the algorithm. Not allowing for errors between haplotypes and the classes to which they correspond is then advantageous because it reduces the number of possible haplotype pairs for a genotype from 2to 2( is the number of heterozygous loci at a genotype). The number of markers used in both the simulated and the real data is low compared to number of markers that are currently used. Two problems are expected when the number of markers in the data increases. The first and most trivial one is the size of the data which obviously increases. The second problem is that haplotypes become increasingly unique when markers are located on regions more distant on the genome due to occurrence of recombinations and random sampling of independent chromosomes. Performance of the DP algorithm can be expected to be low when the number of haplotypes unique in the crossbred population increases. A practical solution could be to split the data into subsets of adjacent markers on single chromosomes or to use a sliding window approach over chromosomes. The algorithm could be adapted to allow for missing marker data. Let  be the number of missing markers for a specific individual. The likelihood in Expression 2 should then only be evaluated for the  -  non missing markers  since the other markers always match. The summations in Expressions 6  7 and 9 should only account for the number of non missing markers   - . In essence  the model would need to evaluate the non missing markers in each individual  since individuals are sampled independently. In the present article  we introduced a new algorithm for inference of line origin of alleles in crossbred populations. Analyses with both simulated and real data showed that origin of approximately 95% of the alleles at heterozygous sites was inferred correctly. Application of the algorithm to realistic data will require extension of the algorithm with methods to deal with large numbers of markers and with missing data.

Cluster analysis of kinship can elucidate the population structure  since this method divides the population in clusters of related individuals. Kinship-based analyses have been carried out on the entire Icelandic Sheepdog population  a sheep-herding breed. Analyses showed that despite increasing population size and deliberately transferring dogs  considerable genetic diversity has been lost. When cluster analysis was based on kinships calculated seven generation backwards  as performed in previous studies  results differ markedly from those based on calculations going back to the founder-population  and thus invalidate recommendations based on previous research. When calculated back to the founder-population  kinship-based clustering reveals the distribution of genetic diversity  similarly to strategies using mean kinship. Although the base population consisted of 36 Icelandic Sheepdog founders  the current diversity is equivalent to that of only 2.2 equally contributing founders with no loss of founder alleles in descendants. The maximum attainable diversity is 4.7  unlikely achievable in a non-supervised breeding population like the Icelandic Sheepdog. Cluster analysis of kinship coefficients can provide a supporting tool to assess the distribution of available genetic diversity for captive population management. Closed populations with high levels of genetic drift suffer from reduction of genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is essential to maintain the adaptive potential of populations  and confers higher resistance to pathogens. In the end  reduction of genetic diversity causes higher levels of inbreeding  which can cause inbreeding depression as well as high incidences of particular heritable (often recessive) diseases. Managing genetic diversity within populations is necessary to avoid high incidences of deleterious alleles and to preserve adaptive potential. In managed populations  such as domestic animals  genetic diversity can be maximised by selection according to optimal contributions  giving each reproductive animal a specific contribution for the next generations [  ]. However  for many populations  this optimal approach cannot be applied as a breeding strategy  because there is not one single authority that can decide which animals to select for breeding. These populations can still increase their genetic diversity with sub-optimal solutions  which require an overview of the genetic diversity within these populations. Hence  individual breeders need insight in the population structure and in how genetic diversity can be maintained. Ubbink . [–] have used cluster analysis of kinship coefficients to elucidate the relational structure of purebred dog populations  and to demonstrate correlation with a genetic disease present in these populations. Instead of 'looking at a large pile of pedigrees' or a table with mean kinships []  they used hierarchical cluster analysis to visualise the hitherto unknown structure of pedigreed populations into separate highly related clusters ('family groups') that have a certain level of kinship (relationship) among each other. A dog breed is an example of an 'unsupervised' closed population [] in which mating is only allowed between registered dogs of the same breed. Purebred dogs are subject to strong selection to meet the breed standards. Dog breed populations can go through a permanent reduction of genetic diversity due to three factors: (1) only a small fraction of all pure-bred males and females actually reproduce []; (2) there is an unequal number of litters among reproductive males []; and (3) dog breeds are often fragmented []. This permanent reduction of genetic diversity (bottleneck) has resulted in a high incidence of specific genetic diseases in different breeds  and in some breeds most of the animals are affected or carriers []. It is now well recognised that genetic diseases are a major threat for purebred dog populations []. Icelandic Sheepdogs are bred in several European countries by many individual breeders. It is well known that the current population of Icelandic Sheepdogs descends almost entirely from only a few founders that were selected from remote areas in Iceland between 1955 and 1965. In the work presented here  we investigate the amount of genetic diversity lost and the possibilities to maintain or increase genetic diversity within the Icelandic Sheepdog population considered as a typical closed dog population. Furthermore  cluster analysis is evaluated as a tool and for its potential to identify genetic diversity. We received pedigree data via ISIC [] of the population of Icelandic Sheepdogs in the following countries: the Netherlands (725 records)  Sweden (1367)  Iceland (1654)  Germany (153)  Norway (774)  Denmark (2241) and Finland (113). Pedigree data contained unique ID  father  mother  gender  date of birth  country of birth  and occasionally date of death. Only Iceland had data since 1955. In other countries  breeding started in 1975 or later and most of the data went up to 2002 and some only up to 1998. Except for a few dogs in France  these countries cover the entire Icelandic Sheepdog population. Animals without recorded parents were classified as either (1) 'original founders': animals without any relationship with other founders  documented as such by the kennel clubs  or (2) 'related animals with unknown parents': animals that descend from the 'original founders' or their progeny  but having unknown parentage. Furthermore  some individuals were registered in more than one country. The pedigree data were assembled into a single database table  and animals that were recorded twice were removed based on information on the country of birth. The problem of 'related animals with unknown parents' was solved by assembling all datasets with additional information on parentage from ISIC. After this process  only the original founders had unknown parents. The equivalent complete generations traced for each animal was computed as the sum of the proportion of ancestors known per generation []. Until 1998  pedigrees were complete for all countries. A general life expectancy was estimated separately for males and for females from the interval between date of birth of parents and progeny. If date of death was not recorded  it was estimated by life expectancy. All animals born between 1991 and 1998 were considered as the 'current-population'. Unless otherwise stated  inbreeding and kinship coefficients were calculated using the tabular method. Except for optimal contributions  which were calculated using Fortran  all measures were calculated using Visual Basic. Mean kinship was proposed by Ballou and Lacy [] and is the mean of the kinship coefficients between that individual and all candidates  including the individual itself. Candidates are defined as reproductive individuals of the current population. The mean kinship () for individual  is calculated by Ballou and Lacy [] as: where  is the number of candidates and is the kinship between individual  and individual . The mean kinship of an animal is a measure of the relationship of that individual with a population; animals with a low mean kinship are more valuable for genetic diversity. Mean kinship depends on the population which means that the mean kinship of an animal might change over time when a population changes. In conservation genetics  mean kinship is an important tool to maintain genetic diversity []. The following population diversity measures were used: Average inbreeding () is the average of the inbreeding coefficient of all candidates.  indicates the current risk of inbreeding depression in the current population. Average mean kinship () is the average of mean kinships of all candidates within the population under study []  and was calculated as: Average  kinship  which is predominantly used in conservation [  ]  differs from average  kinship because  includes kinship of animals with themselves. In this work  genetic diversity () is defined as the number of equally contributing founders with no random loss of founder alleles in descendants that would be expected to produce the same average mean kinship (and therefore genetic variation) as in the population under study. is  expressed on the scale of founder genome equivalents [  ] and is calculated by = 1/2. A lower average mean kinship means a higher genetic diversity and thus a higher capacity to adapt as a population. In this work  allelic diversity () is defined as half the number of distinct alleles that are still present in the population under study if all founder alleles were unique. The number of unique founder alleles that survive each year was determined by genedrop []  which was repeated 10.000 times. is also expressed in founder genome equivalents and can therefore be compared with and (see below). For example  if the frequencies of all alleles were equal  would be equal to . monitors the loss of genetic diversity due to extinction of unique (founder-) alleles. In this work  potential diversity () is defined as the maximum genetic diversity the population under study can achieve (expressed in founder genome equivalents). is the genetic diversity obtained when average mean kinship is minimised using Optimal Contribution Selection. is calculated as described in Oliehoek .

However  calculated from Equation  can contain negative contributions  which is impossible in practice.

Therefore  it monitors the unrestorable loss of genetic diversity. For each year a 'current population' was defined as all the animals expected to be alive and the following population-parameters were determined: the current population size; the number of progeny born during that year; the number of founder introductions; and the following diversity measures:         (as described above). Cluster-analysis was performed twice on the current population. (1) The first analysis was based on kinship calculated using the tabular method starting with the founders and then UPGMA was applied for clustering all animals []. To determine the most appropriate number of clusters    the cubic clustering criteria and pseudo- statistic were all examined (SAS Institute  release 9.1  Cary  NC  USA). These clusters are displayed in a dendrogram  which is referred to as the all-gen-tree. (2) The second cluster-analysis was performed as described by Ubbink . []. Kinships between all animals were calculated by the path method [] until seven generations backwards (instead of the tabular method that includes all generations). Note that if the path method included all the generations  results would be equal to the tabular method. Then  all the animals were clustered using UPGMA. Subsequently all the clusters having an average mean kinship greater or equal to 0.0625 were defined as the final clusters and displayed in a dendrogram. This kinship value of 0.0625 that delimits clusters corresponds with kinship between second degree cousins and was used by Ubbink . []. This dendrogram is referred to as the 7-gen-tree. Of the 4680 dogs in the data  36 did not have any parents registered and were recognised as founders by the breeding organisations. All other dogs in the pedigree file descended from these 36 founders. Most founders lived in Iceland and were registered there  except for four animals that lived in Germany. The current population contained 2554 dogs and represented 512 unique parent combinations. For dogs in the current population  the most 'distant' founders appeared in their pedigree 10 to 20 generations back (nine to 19 ancestors between the current animal and the founder). The equivalent complete generations [] traced was 9.1. All the animals of the current population can only carry alleles from the 36 founders. In the Icelandic Sheepdog  just three of the 36 founders contributed more than 80% of the alleles of the current population (results not shown). In other words  in about 80% of cases  the pedigree of every animal in the current population will end with one of these three over-represented founders. Figure  shows the population size and the number of animals born. The population size hardly grew until 1967  and then reached 250 animals. Until 1980  most Icelandic Sheepdogs lived in Iceland but after  their number increased in other countries as well. Figure  shows the number of founder introductions  together with genetic diversity ()  potential diversity ()  and the allelic diversity (). In 1955  the first 20 founders were selected for breeding. These animals were chosen from remote areas in Iceland. . Population Size is the number of animals that were (likely to become) reproductive; # Animals Born indicates the number of puppies that were born during that specific year . # Founders is the number of founders introduced during that specific year; after 1991 no new founder was introduced; is the average mean kinship in founder genome equivalents; is the minimum possible kinship in founder genome equivalents; is half the number of distinct alleles if founders had unique alleles (scale of founder genome equivalents) Figure  has eight points of interest. (1) When 20 founders were selected this resulted in equal    and (all equal to 20). (2) has decreased since 1955  despite 10 founder introductions up till 1973 and six more after 1979. Each newly introduced founder can potentially increase genetic diversity but clearly in this case  founder introductions have not increased . (3) However  each founder introduction increases and by one. (4) Between 1960 and 1964  and have decreased from 24 to less than 10. This remarkable drop is explained by the fact that most of the 20 founders that were introduced in 1955 only produced one offspring and then died during this period. (5) has strongly decreased from 6.9 in 1967 to 3.2 in 1970. This is contemporaneous with the start of the first population size growth. and did not decrease as much during that period. Therefore  the decrease of is caused by unequal allele frequencies and not by extinction or mixing of unique alleles with over-represented alleles. The strong decrease of is due to a disproportional contribution of a small number of individuals to the future generation. (6) Unequal representation of founder animals in offspring is also responsible for the decrease of during the first years. (7) The distance between and has increased ever since 1963 and reached 5.2 in 1997  which means that it became increasingly difficult to equalise allele frequencies. In other words  5.2 founder genome equivalents were lost because of unique alleles mixing with over-represented alleles within individuals. Optimal Contribution Selection cannot restore this loss. (8) The difference between and shows that this population has the potential to increase genetic diversity. Figure  shows   which is the average mean kinship expressed in probabilities instead of founder genome equivalents ()  in order to compare  with average inbreeding (). Inbreeding starts at 0 and is initially lower than kinship  which is expected because kinship includes kinship of individuals with itself. Later inbreeding increases at a higher rate than kinship  and the average inbreeding becomes higher than the average mean kinship (in percentage)  from 1980 till 1997. This phenomenon can be attributed to geographic subdivision within the population. Breeding occurs mainly between dogs within a given country  and the dogs are more related to each other. . Figure  is a histogram of all pairwise kinship values calculated by using all generations among the 2554 dogs of the current population. This histogram is multi-modal  which indicates the existence of clusters. Figure  gives the cubic clustering criterion and the -values for different numbers of clusters (1 to 25). At cluster numbers of 3  5 and 8   shows a jump. Up to eight cluster numbers  cubic clustering criterion is around zero or less. However  when the number of clusters equals 8  it increases to 26.2  which means that the  is larger than can be expected from a normal distribution. The pseudo- statistic was highest at a cluster number of 8 (1066). Eight clusters were selected based on these three criteria. . The histogram shows pairwise kinships ranging between 0 and 0.55 with a class interval of 0.001; the area under the curve equals the total number of observed pairwise kinship among all 2554 dogs of the current population . The cubic clustering criterion (CCC) and the  squared per number of clusters (1 to 25). Figure  shows the all-gen-tree  which is the dendrogram from the cluster analysis of the current population based on kinship coefficients calculated by the tabular method starting with the founders (all generations) having eight clusters: A to H. Figure  shows the 7-gen-tree  which is the dendrogram from the cluster analysis of the current population based on kinship coefficients calculated by the path method from the current population back to seven generations. The all-gen-tree clusters (A to H) are inserted for each dog to each cluster in the 7-gen-tree. Each cluster represents a number of animals that are highly related to each other. Branches indicate the kinship among the clusters. The 7-gen-tree differs substantially from the all-gen-tree. The all-gen-tree consists of one large cluster A  representing 2236 animals and a few smaller clusters (representing altogether 318 animals). However  in the 7-gen-tree  this cluster A is split at a much lower kinship-level i.e. 0.055. The smaller clusters of the all-gen-tree  redistribute and sometimes split themselves in the 7-gen-tree. . Results of clustering based on kinship coefficients calculated using the tabular method (all generations included); the legend with codes per cluster was added in order to compare this dendrogram to that in Figure 7; the length per cluster corresponds with the number of (reproductive) individuals  except for cluster A  which is 10 times the size depicted  representing 2236 animals; he line at the 0.0625 kinship level  corresponds with the 'cut-off level' of the cluster analysis of Figure 7 . Results of clustering based on kinship coefficients calculated by the path method for seven generations backwards; the legend represents the clusters as demonstrated in Figure 6; the length per cluster corresponds with the number of individuals  except for the first and the third cluster from the left: the length of the 'green' A fraction corresponds to five times the actual size Ubbink . [] have shown that  in their population  the inclusion of five  six or seven generations yielded virtually identical and reproducible results. Hence  Ubbink . [] have suggested that it is sufficient to calculate kinship seven generations backwards. Based on the substantial difference between the 7-gen-tree and the all-gen-tree in our study  we conclude that this assumption does not hold for the present population. This difference can be explained by the presence of common ancestors that are undetected at five  six or seven generations. An example of such undetected ancestors is given by the strong influence of the three predominant founders. At least 80% of the alleles of the current population descend from these three founders. While these founders dominate the pedigree many generations back  they remain undetected at five  six or seven generations. These three founders  possibly together with other frequently used ancestors  cause the difference between the 7-gen-tree and the all-gen-tree. The cluster analysis based on all generations is therefore a better representation of real kinship. Table  gives the diversity measures:         for each of the eight clusters treating each cluster as a separate 'population'. Note that mean kinship depends on this cluster. In Table  mean kinship is calculated within each cluster; thus mean kinship calculated per cluster differs from mean kinship calculated for the current population as shown in Figure  (see below). The  of cluster A is only a little higher than the  of the population. Since cluster A contains 85% of the population  it largely determines the  of the population. Table  shows that while average inbreeding differs per cluster  the average mean kinship is roughly the same for most clusters; is between 1.7 and 2.0. Only the cluster F  which contains only two animals  has an of 1.2. This is because kinship of an animal with itself has a higher effect on the total kinship in small populations. No single cluster can contain all the potential diversity. Moreover  within each cluster  the potential diversity is hardly higher than   whereas for the population as a whole  more than double (4.7 vs. 2.2). This indicates that an increase of genetic diversity in the current population can be achieved by optimisation between clusters but not by breeding within clusters. Each cluster could potentially contribute to genetic diversity. The small difference of and within clusters also indicates that all dogs within the cluster are strongly related to each other. . Results of clustering based on kinship coefficients calculated by the tabular method (all generations included) of all reproductive Icelandic Sheepdogs; mean kinship per animals was implemented; grey-scales indicate the mean kinship for each animal; higher mean kinships show darker and therefore less important genetically Although genetic diversity () of the current population of the Icelandic Sheepdog was only 2.2  the potential diversity () was 4.7. In other words  could be increased from 2.2 to = 4.7. However  this value can be achieved within a few generations only if specific animals are used for breeding according to their specific optimal contribution (as in vector: ) as calculated for each of the 2554 animals. Table  shows for each cluster in the all-gen-tree: a) the relative size of each cluster toward the current population in percentage and b) the optimal contributions per individual summed per cluster. Table  shows that animals within the small clusters E to H  would have to contribute for 12% up to 23% per cluster  while their cluster sizes are smaller than 1% of the total population size. The optimal contribution per animal ranged from zero to 8% (of a total of 100%). In the ideal situation  2410 animals of the 2554 would not contribute  while 50 animals would contribute for 80% in future generations. This optimal breeding scheme would require a complete control over the population. This scheme based on optimal contributions will most probably not be applied in multi-breeder ('unsupervised') populations like dog breeds because many breeders would not be allowed to breed at all. Figure  shows the all-gen-tree (as in Figure )  including the country of birth for each dog in each cluster. It illustrates the geographic distribution of kinship clusters of the current population. One large cluster (cluster A) contains almost every dog of Scandinavia and contains 85% of the total population size. It includes the entire Norwegian and Finnish populations and almost every animal born in Sweden or Denmark  and a large part of the population of Iceland. Cluster B contains the rest of the Icelandic population  except for the distant cluster F that consists of two full-sibs born in Iceland. The related clusters C and E mainly contain the Dutch population. Most German Icelandic Sheepdogs are found in the most distant clusters G and H. German and Dutch populations are less related to Scandinavian populations mainly because the five founders that were introduced between 1970 and 1990 in Germany were unrelated to other founders. However  those founders were not recognised by the Iceland kennel club as being true Icelandic Sheepdogs and thus  were not often used outside Germany. . Results of clustering based on kinship coefficients calculated by the tabular method (all generations included) of all reproductive Icelandic Sheepdogs; colours indicate the fractions of each family group born in a particular country; the length per cluster and each country per cluster correspond with the number of individuals  except for cluster A that represented 2236 animals and each country within cluster A was scaled down by a factor 10 The reason why a single large Scandinavian cluster exists is not only due to the founder-effect. Many sheepdog imports from Iceland were carried out to increase diversity (\"new blood\") within each country. Breeders often think that within one country dogs are more related to each other and belong to the same cluster and they are often unaware that dogs from other countries might also belong to the same cluster. Since importing a dog is a large investment  breeders always selected the 'best dogs' from Iceland. Without knowing  Scandinavian mainland-countries imported highly related dogs time and again. This close relationship was not obvious on the standard pedigree forms given out by studbooks  because they indicate only three or at the most five generations. This lack of knowledge about true kinship among animals explains the occurrence of one large highly related cluster. Undetected relatedness is also the cause for the significant difference between cluster-analysis based on seven or on all generations (Figure  and ). For several generations  related animals appear unrelated because pedigrees only go back three to five generations. Founder and other ancestors from previous generations might contribute significantly to kinship but are not detected at this level. Mean kinship per animal was calculated for the current population. Figure  shows the all-gen-tree dendrogram (as in Figures  and ) with mean kinships per animal displayed in each cluster. Note that mean kinships differ from those in Table  where mean kinship was calculated  each cluster. The distance of each cluster to cluster A decreases mean kinship of animals of that cluster. This means that a conservation strategy based on selecting animals from distant clusters would give similar results than that based on selecting animals with a low mean kinship. While selection by optimal contributions is not possible within a multi-breeder population  cluster analysis could help in increasing genetic diversity. Cluster analysis can provide insight in the population structure for individual breeders  which helps to persuade them to select dogs from distant clusters. In the populations of other breeds studied by Ubbink . [  ]  specific genetic diseases could be linked with some specific clusters and breeders were advised not to use any dogs from a cluster associated with the disease. Table  and Figure  show that populations might lose more diversity than breeders would expect when such a decision is based on a cluster analysis performed only with seven generations. This emphasizes the importance of including all generations in kinship calculation  or at least as many generations as possible. Lacy [] has recommended to maintain = 20 to guaranty adequate genetic variability. of the Icelandic Sheepdog was only 2.2. Leroy . [] have found a higher value (= 5.2 to 25) for nine French dog breeds. However  these results are difficult to compare since the correction for 'related animals with unknown parents' was not implemented because they were treated as founders []. Glazewska [] have reported a founder genome equivalent of 1.3 in Polish hound  which is comparable with the of 1.3 and concludes that Polish hound has a dramatic low level of genetic variability. Overall  it is surprising that  at the time of our study  the Icelandic Sheepdog did not show any genetic disease considering its level of inbreeding. Fortunately  the population size is still increasing  which usually lowers genetic drift. The overall picture of the Icelandic Sheepdog breed is as follows. The Icelandic Sheepdog breed was built from founders  located on remote areas of Iceland between 1955 and 1970. A good part of the diversity was already lost during the first years of the development of the breed. Figure  shows that about 16 of the original 26 founder genomes were lost by 1966. In a recent study [] of a subset of 133 dogs born in Iceland  the average inbreeding coefficient was 0.21  which is in agreement with the average inbreeding found in clusters A  B and C (Table ). Breeding preferentially a few (and often related) animals  led to further reduction of genetic diversity. Thus  the potential diversity of Icelandic Sheepdogs  which was mainly present in animals from Iceland was not disseminated and in fact  decreased even within Iceland. In 1998  the was only 4.7 and genetic diversity was less than half of that and equalled = 2.2. Thus  in other words: the current population had a genetic diversity equal to 2.2 equally contributing founders with no random loss of founder alleles in descendants. An increase of genetic diversity to = 4.7 is not possible within a few generations in a multi-breeder population like the Icelandic Sheepdog. Breeding with animals having a low mean kinship is an important conservation method []. Cluster analysis is consonant with mean kinship: distant clusters contain animals with a low mean kinship and potential diversity within clusters is hardly higher than genetic diversity (Table )  while within the current population as a whole  potential diversity is almost twice the current diversity. Cluster analysis of kinship coefficient based on all generations reveals the population structure and provides better insight on where to find genetic diversity. The all-gen-tree of Figure  shows that the genetically important animals are mainly in Iceland  Holland and Germany. Therefore  cluster analysis is suitable especially for exchanging information on genetic diversity in small closed pedigreed multi-breeder populations. Although conservation of genetic diversity by means of optimal contribution selection is unlikely to happen within a multi-breeder population  preservation of potential diversity may be the second best option  when few animals are involved. In the Icelandic Sheepdog  optimal contributions show that the number of individuals with the highest potential genetic diversity equals about 50. It remains to be seen whether it is possible to convince some breeders to use those animals for breeding or for cryo-conservation of semen and oocytes. This research underlines that dog breeds suffer from genetic drift continuously. Often dog breeding is only authorized with animals meeting specific criteria. These selection criteria  like show-qualifications and health status reports  often strongly limit the number of animals used in breeding. Moreover  certain specific animals are genetically important (see also Table )  but in practice  these animals are often not used at all because they do not meet the previously mentioned selection criteria. Therefore  selection criteria might unintentionally accelerate loss of genetic and/or potential diversity  which is harmful for populations as a whole.

Combining genomic selection with gene-assisted selection for the target QTL acted as an extra precaution against loss of the target QTL and gave additional genetic gain for disease resistance. However  the effect on total merit index was limited. In domesticated populations  specific traits of interest may be improved through introgression of genes from a donor line favourable with respect to a trait of interest (.  a wild population resistant to a specific disease). However  the donor line is often inferior with respect to other traits included in the breeding objective of the recipient line (.  production)  which hampers crossbreeding. Introgression schemes may be carried out through a backcross breeding program aimed at introgressing a single gene from the donor line into the genomic background of a recipient line  where molecular markers can be used to assess the presence of the introgressed gene []. Successful marker-assisted introgression programs have been conducted  using markers linked to known QTL positions [  ]. An alternative strategy to traditional introgression schemes is to combine introgression and QTL detection into a single step []. An even simpler approach is to combine introgression with a genomic selection program []  where individuals are selected based on estimated marker effects distributed over the entire genome. Hence  within-strain selection for desired alleles from both lines may be initiated directly on the F1 crossbreds avoiding loss of time on initial QTL detection studies. In a previous simulation study []  genetic material was introgressed from a donor line (inferior with respect to production  but superior with respect to disease resistance)  into a recipient line (superior with respect to production  but inferior with respect to disease resistance)  assuming that both traits were controlled by many QTL. The results indicated that  compared with pure breeding  an introgression program using genomic selection produces a more resistant and economically competitive crossbred population within relatively few generations [–]. Therefore  introgression combined with genomic selection was suggested as a tool for introgressing genetic material from inferior donor lines into recipient populations. The current study is an extension of the previous study  taking a major QTL into consideration. Typical introgression programs  aim at introgressing one or more alleles of interest from the donor line  while simultaneously reducing the amount of donor DNA to a minimum. Here  genomic selection will not necessarily reduce the amount of donor DNA  but should lead to an increase of the frequency of favourable alleles  irrespective of their origin []. In simulated introgression schemes  Groen and Smith [] have concluded that selection for genomic similarity to the recipient line is less efficient than selection for phenotype. In the current study  individuals are selected based on total genetic value  summed over all markers (irrespective of origin). Hence  any favourable allele from the donor line may be introgressed. Introgression of major QTL alleles is therefore likely  although not assured. This strategy is particularly relevant when (major) QTL are not known prior to selection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genomic selection methods [] can be used to introgress a major QTL allele through a backcrossing program in a situation where both the location and the effect of the QTL alleles are unknown  and when the trait is also affected by numerous minor genes. The genomic selection schemes was compared with classical selection schemes without the use of any genomic information and schemes using genomic selection for minor QTL combined with gene-assisted selection for the major QTL. The latter alternative can be seen as a best-case scenario for introgression of specific QTL alleles of interest. The selection experiment was designed to use genetic resources from two partially separated populations. Generally  two fish populations were simulated as in Ødegård . []. The common base population was generated and mated randomly with replacement for 10 000 generations (effective population size N = 1000)  subsequently the base population was randomly split into two equally sized (N = 1000) subpopulations  which were kept separate for the following 250 generations. Finally  for 10 generations  one population (recipient line) was phenotypically selected for a production trait (PT)  with a heritability of 0.1  by selecting the top 10% of males and top 10% of females. The other population (donor line) was randomly selected with replacement (random 10% of the males and females). The purpose of the separation period was to generate two partially differentiated populations that were at different genetic levels for important traits. A single major QTL for disease resistance (DR) was assumed to segregate only within the donor line. Randomly selected sires and dams from the resulting two lines were then used as parents for two lines; one purebred recipient line selected for PT only (PRL = production line) and an F1 cross in the following selection experiment over five generations (S1 to S5). Different replicates were simulated separately  but the initial generation (S0) was identical for all scenarios within each replicate. Two selection strategies were used for generations S1 – S5: 1) Pure breeding of the recipient line for backcrossing for a breeding objective including only one production trait (PT)  .  a production line (PRL)  which represents an external commercial population included in a classical selection program for improved production  and 2) an introgression strategy by creating F1 crossbreds of recipient and donor lines  followed by repeated backcrossing to the PRL  .  a BACKCROSS line. Backcrossing was done only to the extent that females from the PRL were superior to females recruited from within the crossbred population based on their EBV for total merit index (TMI)  .  females were selected among all candidates in both populations  while males were selected within the crossbred population only. For generations S0 to S5  all lines were kept at a constant size of 1000 breeding candidates within each line. For the parents of S0  random selection and mating using sampling with replacement was applied  while  for the later generations  truncation selection based on predicted EBV was used (50 sires and 50 dams per line). The selected sires and dams were randomly mated (using sampling with replacement) to create 50 full-sib families with 20 offspring each to form selection candidates for the next generation for each line. Additionally  all 50 families within the BACKCROSS line each produced 20 offspring  which were used in sib-testing for DR. The genome structure in this simulation was identical to that of Ødegård . []  .  with 10 diploid 100 cM chromosomes assuming the Haldane mapping function and a Mendelian inheritance of all loci. For each chromosome  500 marker loci were assumed  as well as 100 QTL per trait (PT and DR). Markers and QTL loci were randomly spaced throughout each chromosome. Rates of mutations (per allele and meiosis for each generation) for marker and QTL alleles were 0.0001 and 0.00001  respectively. Mutation rates at markers were increased to ensure that most markers were segregating. All mutations generated new alleles  and thus  all loci were potentially multi-allelic. The QTL allelic effects were assumed to be additive  and were sampled from a gamma distribution (shape and scale parameters of 0.40 and 0.13  respectively). Since this distribution only produces positive values  each QTL allelic effect had a 50% probability of being switched to a negative value. No pleiotropy was assumed  implying zero genetic covariance between the traits before selection. At generation t = 10 250 (10 000 + 250)  QTL effects of both traits were scaled to achieve identical background genetic standard deviations (= 1.0) for both traits within the recipient line for all replicates (before selection). Scaling of QTL effects was identical for all individuals  irrespective of population. At generation t = 10 260 (10 000 + 250 + 10)  ~80% of the marker loci and ~15% of the QTL were segregating within each subpopulation. Linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers was calculated as the standardized chi-square  ' [  ]. Within each base population  average calculated and expected [] LD for adjacent markers (expectation based on actual distance) were both 0.2. At generation S0 of the selection experiment  genomes of all individuals were scanned to identify bi-allelic QTL affecting DR  where one of the alleles happened to be fixed in the recipient line  but an alternative allele existed in the donor line. The QTL displaying the largest difference in allele frequencies between the lines was assumed to be a major QTL. The favourable allele (the allele absent in the recipient line) was given a genotypic value [] of a = 2.0 (twice the background genetic standard deviation)  while the genotypic value of the alternative allele was a = -2.0. As in the study by Ødegård [].  the true breeding value of an individual was defined as the sum of QTL allelic effects for the individual across all 1000 QTL loci for each trait. Phenotypes of both traits were produced by adding normally distributed error terms  sampled from (0  )  to the true breeding values of each individual. Heritabilities are presented as the following:  where  is the (background) additive genetic variance (= 1.0 for both traits) within the original recipient line (not segregating for the major QTL)  and  is the residual variance (= 9.0 for both traits). The resulting background heritability (not accounting for the major QTL) was therefore 0.10 for both PT and DR. It was assumed that all individuals within the BACKCROSS line were genotyped for the available 5000 marker loci. The PT was recorded on all selection candidates (1000 individuals per line and generation)  while disease resistance (DR) was recorded on full-sibs of the selection candidates  using a challenge-test type of design (1000 individuals per generation for the BACKCROSS line). For the PRL  only the average genetic level of DR was assumed to be available. Individuals challenge-tested for DR were not considered as selection candidates. For comparison purposes  genomic (GBLUP)  gene-assisted genomic (GasGBLUP) and classical (CBLUP) EBV were produced and used as selection criteria. The GBLUP were estimated as in Ødegård . [] using the BLUP estimation procedure of marker effects []. Marker by base population effects were estimated  .  all markers were traced back to their original populations. For GasGBLUP  the same method was used  but the effect of the major QTL was assumed known in the breeding value estimation. The CBLUP were estimated using classical BLUP []. The CBLUP of DR for selection candidates was calculated based on sib and pedigree data (including phenotypes back to generation S0). The GBLUP and GasGBLUP values were scaled by a factor    in order to make them directly comparable to CBLUP values. All breeding values and the factor  were re-estimated for each generation (the latter was based on all individuals with genomic EBV across generations). Backcrossing schemes were conducted for the different selection criteria (using CBLUP  GBLUP and GasGBLUP). Two sets of economic weights were used; either 100% (2:1) (Scenario 1) or 50% (3:2) (Scenario 2) higher relative weight on PT compared with DR (Table ). In the crossbred population  selection was for total merit index (TMI)  with the selection criteria defined as the sum of predicted breeding values for both traits  multiplied by their corresponding economic weights. For all settings  the PRL was selected for PT using only the CBLUP selection criterion. A total of 50 replicates were produced for each scenario and selection scheme. Within each replicate  the average frequency of the favourable major QTL allele and the average level of true breeding values (DR  PT and TMI) were calculated  and subsequently averaged over all 50 replicates. Genetic gains for PT  DR and TMI were calculated as average differences in true genetic level from generation S0 to S5. For comparison purposes  the expected frequency of the target QTL given no selection (but identical amounts of backcrossing) was calculated as the expected genetic contribution of the donor population (based on pedigree) multiplied with the original frequency of the favourable target allele in the donor population. At generation S0  the average genetic differences (in background genetic standard deviations) between the recipient (PRL) and the F1 crossbred populations were 2.5 and -0.4 for PT and DR  respectively (difference in DR mainly due to the major QTL). Consequently  TMI differed for the two populations. Assuming 100% higher economic weight for PT (economic weights 2:1)  the average difference in TMI was 2.1 genetic standard deviations  and 1.9 genetic standard deviations  assuming 50% higher economic weight for PT (economic weights 3:2). The initial frequency of the favourable major QTL allele was 0% in the PRL (recipient) line and  on average  23% in the F1 BACKCROSS population. Genetic levels by generation for PT  DR and TMI are shown in Figure ( and   respectively) and genetic gains (from S0 to S5) are shown in Table . As in Ødegård . []  genomic selection was in general favourable compared with classical selection. With respect to DR (the trait affected by the major QTL)  there were substantial differences in genetic gain between the alternatives using classical selection (CBLUP) and those using genomic selection (GBLUP and GasGBLUP). As a result of repeated backcrossing with the PRL  no significant genetic gain for DR was achieved through CBLUP. However  substantial genetic gain was achieved when using genomic selection  both as a result of the more efficient within-line selection and as a result of less sustained backcrossing with the PRL. As expected  genetic gain in DR was the highest with GasGBLUP (increase by 40%  compared with GBLUP). The selection methods differed much less with respect to genetic gain for PT  .  selection for improved PT was about as efficient using genomic or classical selection (-1% and -2% for GBLUP and GasGBLUP  respectively) despite more backcrossing with PRL under classical selection. Consequently  genetic gain in TMI was higher for genomic than for classical selection (13 and 18% increase for GBLUP and GasGBLUP  respectively). The relatively limited advantage of GasBLUP over GBLUP with respect to genetic gain in TMI (4%) can be explained by the high relative economic weight of PT. . The frequencies of the favourable major QTL allele by generation are shown in Figure  (single replicates and average level). In the introgression schemes using classical selection (CBLUP)  backcrossing with the PRL line was continued throughout the entire selection experiment  and average expected frequency of \"neutral\" donor alleles (based on pedigree) was therefore as low as 4% at generation S5 (Figure ). Consequently  average frequency of the favourable major QTL allele also dropped from 23% at generation S0 to 4% in generation S5  and ended up as lost in 27 out of 50 replicates (Figure ). For the introgression schemes using genomic selection (GBLUP/GasGBLUP)  backcrossing with the PRL mainly occurred up to generation S2  and the expected frequency of \"neutral\" donor alleles in the GBLUP/GasGBLUP alternatives thus stabilized at  respectively  15 and 16% towards the end of the selection experiment (Figure  and ). Using GBLUP  the average frequency of the favourable allele for the major QTL dropped from 23% at generation S0 to 11% at generation S2 (Figure )  as a result of backcrossing with PRL. Using GasGBLUP  the frequency of the favourable major QTL allele was stable for S0 to S2 (Figure ). However  as a result of genomic/gene-assisted selection within the crossbred population  the average frequency of the major QTL increased from S2 and onwards for both GBLUP and GasGBLUP (to respectively 32% and 81% in generation S5). The favourable QTL allele was never lost using GasGBLUP  but it was lost in 6 out of 50 replicates using GBLUP. . Single dots represent individual replicates  red line average observed frequencies of the target QTL  purple line expected frequencies if the target QTL is not subject to selection and green line expected frequencies of \"neutral\" donor alleles. Genetic gains (from S0 to S5) are shown in Table . Generally  ranking of selection schemes was similar to that in Scenario 1  with the largest differences in genetic gain observed for DR  and the smaller differences in genetic gain observed for PT. Again  genomic selection increased genetic gain for TMI compared with classical selection (16 and 22% for GBLUP and GasGBLUP  respectively). Classical selection led to substantial backcrossing  and the expected amount of \"neutral\" donor alleles was therefore as low as 5% in generation S5 (Figure )  and had a limited effect on the frequency of the favourable major QTL  reaching an average frequency of 5% in generation S5  while being lost in 29 out of 50 replicates (Figure ). . Single dots represent individual replicates  red line average observed frequencies of the target QTL  purple line expected frequencies if the target QTL is not subject to selection and green line expected frequencies of \"neutral\" donor alleles. Compared with GBLUP  GasGBLUP selection was superior with respect to genetic gain in DR (28%)  slightly inferior with respect to genetic gain in PT (-1%) and slightly superior with respect to genetic gain in TMI (5%). Again  backcrossing with the PRL mainly occurred up to generation S2 in both GBLUP and GasGBLUP selection schemes  and the expected frequency of \"neutral\" donor alleles stabilized at 17% and 18%  respectively (Figure  and ). For the GBLUP selection scheme  the frequency of the favourable major QTL allele followed the same pattern as in the scenario above (Figure )  although the initial drop (from S0 to S2) in the average frequency of the favourable major QTL allele was smaller (from 23 in S0 to 13% in S2)  as expected through reduced backcrossing. For the GasGBLUP selection scheme (Figure )  the frequency of the favourable major QTL allele increased throughout the entire selection experiment  but most markedly after generation S2  where backcrossing had essentially ceased. The average end-frequency of the favourable major QTL allele (at S5) was 43% and 93%  for GBLUP and GasGBLUP schemes  respectively. Again  the favourable allele was never lost using GasGBLUP  but it was lost in 5 out of 50 replicates for GBLUP. The results of this study clearly show that genomic selection can to a large extent identify relevant DNA segments for both traits and use this information in selection  while classical selection has a limited effect on alleles affecting DR  even for a QTL of very large effect. Consequently  backcrossing programs using GBLUP selection are far more efficient in preserving and increasing frequencies of such alleles  while for CBLUP selection programs these alleles may easily be lost during the backcrossing process. The advantage of genomic over classical selection with respect to a major QTL for DR may be explained by two main factors: 1) generally higher accuracy of selection for GBLUP compared with CBLUP [] and 2) for a trait solely recorded on sibs of selection candidates  classical selection can only distinguish between families  while genomic selection may distinguish between single individuals of different genotypes within families segregating for the major QTL. With respect to the major QTL  the most efficient selection schemes were those combining genomic selection with gene-assisted selection for the target QTL. However  the relative advantage of GasBLUP relative to GBLUP selection was rather small with respect to genetic gain in TMI (4–5%). In GBLUP selection  the favourable allele was lost in a few replicates (5–6 out of 50)  which never happened using GasGBLUP. Therefore  the results of this study indicate that the main advantage of GasGBLUP compared with GBLUP selection is that it acts as a precaution against the loss of the favourable major QTL allele during the early backcrossing phase. This is of special importance if the allele of interest has a low frequency within the donor population  and when the target QTL is in unfavourable LD with other loci  since selection on the target QTL would be detrimental for background genetic effects. However  because of the latter  rapid introgression of the major QTL is not necessarily a substantial advantage. As long as the favourable allele of the target QTL is preserved  it would most likely approach fixation in the long run. Further  according to a study by Gibson []  less intense selection on a major QTL is likely to increase the long-term genetic gain  implying that GBLUP selection is expected to be superior over GasGBLUP selection in the long run  except for replicates where the favourable QTL alleles were lost during the initial backcrossing process. However  in Gibson's study  unfavourable LD between the major QTL and the background genetic effects were generated as a result of selection  while in our case  such unfavourable relationships are present already at the start of the selection experiment as a result of crossing the two base populations  .  the positive QTL allele is located on a donor chromosome segment that is more likely to contain negative alleles with respect to PT. Thus  in the current introgression scheme  substantial weight on the target QTL is needed in order to avoid its loss  whereas in Gibson's single population  risk of loss is low even if the major QTL receives little weight. In this study  the genotypic value of the major QTL implies that this locus explains 2/3 of the total genetic variance in DR within a population having an allele frequency of 50% (assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). The advantage of efficient introgression of the favourable allele will increase with the effect of the allele and with the economic weight of DR. However  for all selection methods  the efficiency of selection with respect to the target QTL will also increase with the same factors. Preliminary analyses using Scenario 2  showed that for a doubled genotypic value of the target QTL  GasGBLUP selection only slightly increased genetic gain for DR (7%) and hardly increased genetic gain in TMI (1%)  compared with GBLUP selection (results not shown). Hence  the relative advantage of gene-assisted selection is seemingly lower for QTL of very large effect  since the favourable allele would be preserved and effectively selected for even without gene-assisted selection. The GasGBLUP schemes require that knowledge on both the exact position of the target QTL and its effect exists prior to the selection experiment  in addition to a dense marker map including segregating marker loci for both populations. If this knowledge is readily available prior to the experiment  the GasGBLUP method is naturally preferred. This can be considered a best-case scenario  but in practical breeding schemes  these assumptions would often be unrealistic. The GBLUP selection schemes do not require prior knowledge about the target QTL  and are therefore much easier to implement. An alternative approach would be to do simultaneous QTL detection and introgression as described in Yazdi . []. However  the latter approach would be less efficient when applied to complex traits affected by numerous QTL of varying effects  while genomic selection is well suited to handle this situation. Due to computing time considerations  the BLUP method of genomic selection was used. This method assumes homogeneous genetic variance at all marker loci []. However  more advanced methods of genomic selection are also available  .  the so-called BayesA and BayesB methods []. Here  the genetic variance explained by each marker locus is evaluated and different weights are thereby given to different genomic regions in the EBV calculation. Thus  these more advanced methods are expected to be more effective in selecting QTL of major importance  and the results of the current study should therefore be considered as conservative. In a recent study []  where analyses were based on simulated crossbred populations using the BayesB method  it was concluded that fitting population-specific marker effects may not be necessary  especially for high marker densities. However  using the BLUP method  as in the current study  all markers are assumed to have effects of equal magnitude  not only the markers in closest association with QTL (as in BayesB). Hence  fitting population-specific markers may be of more importance  since QTL effects are likely to be attributed to a broader distribution of markers. In previous stochastic simulation or deterministic studies of introgression programs targeting a major QTL  donor and recipient lines are often assumed to be unrelated and fixed for alternative target QTL alleles [    ]. For livestock and farmed fish  these assumptions are usually unrealistic  and provide idealized conditions for the introgression programs. In the current study  the donor and recipient lines were assumed to be only partially differentiated  and the target QTL was chosen among loci that happened to be segregating only within the donor line (since this would make introgression necessary). Hence  introgression of the major QTL would not be guaranteed by crossing the recipient line with a small sub-sample of individuals from the donor line  and one would rarely have markers in perfect LD with the major QTL. However  some simplified assumptions were made  .  the assumption of no pleiotropy  implying zero genetic correlation (before selection) between disease resistance and the production trait (.  growth). The latter is not necessarily unrealistic  but the assumption of complete absence of pleiotropic effects on all loci is most likely over-simplified. Actually  numerous pleiotropic effects in both directions (favourable/unfavourable) may underlie a genetic correlation close to zero. However  under the current assumption  different QTL for the two traits will often be closely linked  which will have an effect that resembles pleiotropic QTL. The practical consequences of this assumption are thus likely to be limited. In our view  the current method of simulation and (GBLUP) analysis is rather realistic and conservative with respect to the prospects for introgression schemes in livestock and farmed fish populations. There were substantial differences between introgression programs using classical and genomic selection  with the first being generally inferior with respect to both genetic gain and the ability to preserve the target QTL. Combining genomic selection with gene-assisted selection for the target QTL acted as an extra precaution against loss of the target QTL and gave additional genetic gain for disease resistance. However  the effect on total merit index was limited compared with genomic selection without specific knowledge of the target QTL.

In current family-based aquaculture breeding schemes  many important traits are tested on the sibs of the candidates. The test information is used to calculate breeding values for the selection of parents []. Only 50% of the genetic variation  the between family variation  is used in these schemes  which are employed for traits that cannot be measured on the selection candidates such as disease challenge testing and slaughter quality traits. Dense marker maps and high-throughput genotyping have become increasingly available in aquaculture species. Genomic selection is a selection method where the effects of dense genetic markers are first estimated in a test population and later used to predict breeding values of selection candidates []. The sib-test design can be used for marker-assisted selection [] or genomic selection  where the association between markers and phenotypes is estimated in the sibs of the candidates  and the candidates are selected on breeding values that result from summing the estimates of the effects of their marker alleles. For aquaculture breeding schemes  genomic selection may prove very useful  because the breeding goals include many traits that are based on information from the sibs and not from the candidates  and therefore genomic selection can result in increased accuracy of selection for those traits by using both between- and within-family genetic variances. The aim of this paper was to investigate genetic gains  inbreeding and the accuracy of selection in a general genomic selection scheme for aquaculture  where selection is based on information from the sibs of the candidates. Schemes with different numbers of candidates and test animals (sibs of the candidates) and with different heritabilities of the trait under selection were compared by computer simulation. In addition  the importance of performing the sib-test every generation  which is costly for the breeding program  was assessed. Finally  the effect of selection on the accuracy of selection was evaluated. A population with an effective population size (N) of 1000 was simulated for 4000 generations according to the Fisher-Wright population model [  ]. Five hundred males and 500 females were randomly selected and mated using sampling with replacement. Among the individuals of the last of these 4000 generations  100 males and 100 females were randomly selected to create 100 full-sib families  which each produced 30 or 60 progeny to form generation Gen0. These progeny were selection candidates and were not performance tested. However  in addition to these selection candidates  every family also produced 30 or 60 full-sibs  which entered into a sib-test where they were performance tested. One hundred sires and 100 dams were selected from the candidates to produce generation Gen1 by either (a) random selection  whereby a sire and a dam were randomly sampled with replacement (RAND) or (b) directional selection  whereby sires and dams with the highest genome-wide breeding values (see Calculation of phenotypic values and true and estimated breeding values) were selected without any restriction on the number of parents selected from each family. Again each of the 100 sires was mated to one of the 100 dams  using sampling without replacement  to produce 30 or 60 full-sib selection candidates and 30 or 60 sib-test progeny in generation Gen1. This scheme was repeated until generation Gen10. Hence  with the number of families  Nfamilies  being 100  the total number of candidates  Ncand  was 3000 or 6000 and the total number of sib-test progeny  Ntested  was 3000 or 6000. In one scheme  Nfamilies = 200  Ncand = 3000 and Ntested = 3000. The idea here was to reduce the number of sib-tests by not performing a sib-test every generation. Four different strategies of sib-testing were compared: EVERY GENERATION (EVERY-GEN): sib-testing was performed in every generation Gen0-Gen10 as described above in 2.1. FIRST GENERATION (FIRST-GEN): sib-testing was performed in generation Gen0. EVERY SECOND GENERATION (EVERY-2GEN): sib-testing was performed in the odd generation numbers Gen1  Gen3  ..  Gen9. FIRST 3 GENERATIONS (FIRST-3GEN): sib-testing was performed only during the first three generations Gen0-Gen2. Individuals had a diploid genome with ten 100 cM chromosomes. Recombinations were sampled at random positions on the chromosome assuming the Haldane mapping function. All polymorphisms were generated during the 4000 generations of the Fisher-Wright population model  where a mutation rate of 10 per nucleotide was assumed and the number of nucleotides per cM was 1000000. This effectively resulted in the infinite sites mutation model []   every mutation occurred at a unique position and created a bi-allelic SNP. This mutation process generated numerous SNP  among which 100 per chromosome were sampled randomly as a QTL (sampling without replacement from the SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05)  and among the remaining SNP  the 1000 with the highest MAF were chosen as genetic markers. The latter resulted in a total of markers of Nmarkers = 10000 spread over 1000 cM. Reduced numbers of markers were obtained by taking every 10 marker and every 2 marker  resulting in a total of Nmarkers = 1000 and 5000 markers  respectively. The allelic effects of the QTL alleles were sampled from the gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.4 and a scale parameter of 1.66 []. The QTL effects were assumed to be either positive or negative with a probability of 0.5  because the gamma distribution only gives positive values. After sampling  these QTL allelic effects were standardised so that the total genetic variance was 1.0 in Gen0. The expected average linkage disequilibrium () between two adjacent markers can be approximated by Hill []: where  is the distance between adjacent loci  here on average 0.001 Morgan  which resulted in R = 0.342. In generation Gen0  the realised average  between adjacent markers was 0.374  which is slightly higher than Hill's approximation  probably due to the selection of the markers on their MAF. The true breeding value of an individual was calculated as: where x is the number of copies that individual i has at the j QTL position and k QTL allele  and g is the effect of the k QTL allele at the j position. The phenotypic values of the individuals in the sib-test were simulated by adding an error term sampled from a normal distribution to the true breeding value (): where eis an error term for animal i  which was normally distributed (0  s) and s was adjusted so the heritability was 0.1 or 0.4. Marker effects were predicted using the BLUP method described in []. The statistical model used to estimate the marker effects was: where y is the record of test individual i; µ is the overall mean; X denotes the marker genotype: 0 denotes that the individual is homozygous for the first allele; 1/vH denotes that it is heterozygous; and 2/vH denotes that it is homozygous for the second allele  where H is the marker heterozygosity and thus dividing by vH standardises the variance of the X to 1; a is the random effect of the j marker and Var(a) is assumed 1/Nmarkers (total genetic variance was standardised to 1.0); e is a random residual. Genome-wide breeding values were estimated by summing the effects of the markers: The accuracy of selection (acc) was calculated as the correlation between true and estimated breeding values. The acc was calculated for all schemes  also for the RAND scheme  although the were not used for selection in RAND. Selection schemes were run for ten generations (Gen1-Gen10) and summary statistics for each of the schemes are based on 50 replicated simulations. The breeding schemes were compared for the genetic level (G  expressed in genetic standard deviation units of generation Gen0 (s))  genetic gain (<U+0394>G)  accuracy of selection (acc)  genetic variance  and level and rate of inbreeding (<U+0394>F). Inbreeding was calculated based on pedigree  assuming that the Gen0 individuals are unrelated base parents. The values of these variables were either shown in figures over generations Gen1-Gen10 or in tables with the values in generation 5  when the Bulmer effect had stabilised  and inbreeding had started to build up in the population. Accuracy of selection was the highest for EVERY-GEN and increased from 0.647 to approximately 0.820 over generations (Figure )  due to the increased amount of information on marker effects that becomes available. When phenotypic and genotypic testing was only in the first generation  as for FIRST-GEN  accuracy of selection decreased rapidly over generations and was only 0.304 in generation Gen5. This reduction in accuracy of selection is mainly because of changes in the linkage disequilibrium between marker and QTL. Especially  spurious LD []  which is not due to linkage  changes quickly over generations. When the sib-test was performed every second generation  as for EVERY-2GEN  the accuracy of selection fluctuated  being almost as high as for EVERY-GEN in the generations with sib-testing and lower in the other generations. However  fluctuations decreased over generations  probably because the selection pressure increased favourable marker alleles  and then  their effects became increasingly accurately estimated. For FIRST-3GEN  the accuracy of selection was as high as for EVERY-GEN until generation 3  as expected  and thereafter  the accuracy of selection decreased. However  the reduction during the first generation after selection had stopped was not as large as for EVERY-2GEN  probably because more generations of information on marker effects had built up. In general  the reduction in accuracy of selection after sib-testing had stopped was larger when there were fewer generations of information  the reduction in accuracy of selection was the largest for FIRST-GEN  thereafter EVERY-2GEN  and FIRST-3GEN. . Accuracy of selection (a)  genetic variance (b)  genetic level (c) and inbreeding level (d) for schemes when sib-testing was every year (EVERY-GEN; circles)  every second year (EVERY-2GEN; triangles)  only the first year (FIRST-GEN; cross) or the first three years (FIRST-3GEN; squares); Random selection (solid line); Ncand = 3000  h = 0.4  Nfamilies = 100  Ntested = 3000. The RAND scheme had an accuracy of selection very similar to EVERY-GEN. The genetic variance was reduced over generations of selection  except for the RAND schemes  as expected (Figure ). The genetic variance decreased most for the EVERY-GEN scheme  with the highest accuracy of selection  and least for the FIRST-GEN scheme. For FIRST-GEN  the largest reduction was between generations Gen1 and Gen2. The accuracy of selection and genetic variance resulted in the highest genetic level for EVERY-GEN and the lowest for FIRST-GEN  as expected (Figure ). In generation Gen5  the genetic level was 6.35s for EVERY-GEN and 3.69 s for FIRST-GEN. For FIRST-3GEN  the genetic level was 5.82 s. However  the genetic level of FIRST-3GEN became over time increasingly lower than that of EVERY-GEN. The genetic level of EVERY-2GEN in generation Gen5 was 5.66 s and the difference in genetic level between EVERY-GEN and EVERY-2GEN increased over generations. Inbreeding levels were also the highest for EVERY-GEN  probably because it had the highest accuracy of selection (Figure ). For FIRST-3GEN  the inbreeding level was as high as for EVERY-GEN until generation Gen4  and decreased thereafter  also because of lower accuracy of selection in the generations after the sib-testing had stopped. The effect of different marker densities on the accuracy of selection was large  when increasing Nmarkers from 1000 to 5000  the accuracy of selection increased from 0.661 to 0.823 using EVERY-GEN (Figure ). However  when increasing Nmarkers from 5000 to 10000  the accuracy of selection hardly increased and was 0.842 in Gen5 with Nmarkers = 10000. For FIRST-GEN  the accuracy of selection decreased relatively much faster for the lowest number of markers  1000 (-51%) than for 5000 (-39%) or 10000 (-35%) markers. This suggests that if the markers are sufficiently close to the QTL  the linkage disequilibrium changes less and thus the estimates of the marker effects remain more accurate. . Accuracy of selection for schemes with 1000 (circles)  5000 (squares) or 10000 (triangles) markers when sib-testing was every year (EVERY-GEN; open) or only the first year (FIRST-GEN; filled); Ncand = 3000  h = 0.4  Nfamilies = 100  Ntested = 3000. Table  shows the sensitivity of the results to lower heritability of the trait  higher number of candidates and tested sibs  and higher number of families. Decreasing the heritability from h = 0.4 to 0.1  decreased <U+0394>G by 7%. Similarly  acc was 10% lower for the scheme with low heritability  but <U+0394>F was 50% higher for the scheme with low heritability  because of the increased between-family selection. The vg was 5% higher for the scheme with a low heritability  because of lower selection accuracy. Increasing the number of selection candidates from Ncand = 3000 to 6000 increased <U+0394>G by 10%. The increased genetic gain was mainly the result of higher selection intensity. However  this also resulted in larger increases of allele frequencies of favorable alleles  which in turn resulted in more accurate estimates of these alleles. Thus acc was somewhat higher  0.837 for the scheme with 6000 selection candidates compared to 0.823 for the scheme with 3000 selection candidates. Increasing the number of tested sibs from Ntested = 3000 to 6000 increased acc by only 2.7%  which hardly affected neither <U+0394>G  vg nor <U+0394>F This suggests that Ntested = 3000 is sufficient when h = 0.4. Increasing the number of families from Nfamilies = 100 to 200  reduced <U+0394>F from 0.008 to 0.004  because of the increased numbers of sires and dams selected. The latter resulted in higher genetic variance  which was 21% higher for the scheme with Nfamilies = 200 than with Nfamilies = 100. The acc was 9% and <U+0394>G 19% lower for the scheme with Nfamilies = 200 than with Nfamilies = 100  because selection intensity was reduced. This simulation study examines the accuracies of selection and genetic gain that can be attained with genomic selection sib-testing schemes in aquaculture. Various strategies were evaluated to reduce the amount of sib-testing  but all resulted in a loss of accuracy of selection and thus of genetic gain. Whether these reductions in genetic gains are acceptable will depend on the relative sizes of the reduced benefits and the savings due to less sib-testing. In schemes where selection is for an index combining growth and sib-testing traits  the reduction in accuracy of selection and thus genetic gain will be less than that which was found here due to the reduced importance of the sib-testing traits. How much the accuracy of such an index will be reduced can be assessed using the results in Table  and selection index calculations. The general picture that emerges from Figure  is  however  that continuous phenotypic and genotypic testing is important to maintain the accuracy of the genome-wide breeding values over generations. The results showed that the number of previous generations of sib-testing affected the level of accuracy proportionally  such that the reduction in accuracy of selection over generations was the largest for FIRST-GEN  thereafter EVERY-2GEN  FIRST-3GEN and finally EVERY-GEN. It may be noted that the reduction in accuracy of selection was substantially larger for the first generation after sib-testing had stopped compared to later generations. This may be because within a generation  markers merely explaining family effects can be used for the prediction of breeding values  whereas across generations  the family effects decay. These results agreed with those of []. (Solberg  T.R.  Sonesson  A.K.  J. A. Woolliams  Ødegård  J.  Meuwissen  T.H.E: Persistence of estimates of genome-wide markers over generations when including a polygenic effect  submitted) found a much smaller reduction in the accuracy over generations than we saw here. However  their study did not include the effect of selection. Also  the BayesB method of [] was used instead of BLUP  which may have increased the weight given to markers that are in close LD with the QTL. Habier  [] found that the accuracy of selection did not decrease as much with BayesB as with BLUP  because BayesB gives more weight to the LD when estimating genome-wide breeding values. Hence  the reduction observed in our study may be smaller if the BayesB method was used. During later generations (say generations Gen6-10)  the accuracy of selection was based on LD and its reduction was much smaller  indicating that the LD decayed slowly. Still  the low value of the selection accuracy suggests that in genomic selection breeding schemes also  the prediction of family effects is important and that breeding designs where family effects can be accurately predicted are important. This implies that the relationship between the individuals in the test group and the selection candidates should be as high as possible. When decreasing heritability from 0.4 to 0.1  acc decreased from 0.823 to 0.742 for the basic scheme with 30 sibs per family   a reduction of 0.08. The expected accuracy of selection for a traditional BLUP scheme is 0.66 for a heritability of 0.4 and 0.55 for a heritability of 0.1   a reduction of 0.11[]. Hence  the effect of heritability on the accuracy of selection is somewhat larger for traditional BLUP schemes than for a scheme with genome-wide breeding values  which is in agreement with the literature on genomic selection [] and marker assisted selection ([] and others). The results also showed that the accuracy of selection increased by 25 and 35% when using genomic selection compared to traditional BLUP for the scheme with a heritability of 0.4 and 0.1  respectively. See [] for a more detailed comparison of traditional and genomic selection schemes. Truncation selection for traditional BLUP breeding values [] resulted in a <U+0394>F of 0.043 for the parameters of the basic scheme. Thus  <U+0394>F was dramatically reduced by 81% for the genomic selection schemes compared to the traditional BLUP breeding schemes  although in practical breeding schemes  a way of reducing rates of inbreeding would probably be used   reducing the use of number of parents from single families or using optimum contribution selection. The reduced <U+0394>F for genome-wide breeding values was probably due to the increased possibilities for within-family selection in genomic selection schemes  whilst this is not possible in traditional sib-testing schemes. It was also due to a stronger Bulmer effect since a more accurate selection increases the Bulmer effect  which leads to less between-family variance and thus more within-family selection []. In this study  we used 1000  5000 and 10000 markers on a genome size of 1000 cM and an effective population size (N) of 1000. Hence  the marker density was 0.1  0.5 and 1N/M  which is not very high  but probably in accordance with what a first-generation SNP chip would include for most aquaculture species. For example  with a total genome size of 30M for salmon [] and an assumed N of 1000 (see discussion [])  1N/M implies a SNP chip of 30000 markers. Furthermore  Figure  shows that increasing the marker density from 0.5 to 1N/M produces little extra gain. The low number of records relative to the N explains this plateau and such a plateau has also been reported by [] with a SNP marker density of around 4N/M. The effect of selection on its accuracy was rather small here (EVERY-GEN versus RAND). This result is contrary to that of Muir []  but he did not update the marker effects every generation  which made the accuracy decay rapidly. In the EVERY-GEN scheme  marker effects were updated every generation  but still one might expect that the Bulmer effect  which reduces the genetic variance (Figure )  would also reduce the accuracy of selection  because the signal to noise ratio is reduced. However  a selective genotyping effect occurs  due to selection  resulting in increased frequency and higher accuracy of marker alleles with positive effects. The Bulmer and selective genotyping effects seem to balance each other out approximately  resulting in an accuracy that is hardly reduced by selection. For practical aquaculture breeding schemes  the results of this study have the following implications  which could lead to a new design of the breeding programs. (i) Genotyping with genomic selection generates extra costs  which can be partly recovered by higher <U+0394>G due to the increased accuracy by genomic selection compared with conventional BLUP breeding values. Here  we found an accuracy of around 0.82 for genome-wide breeding values compared with 0.66 for conventional BLUP breeding values  for a sib-test with 30 sibs tested per family and a heritability of 0.4. (ii) The breeding companies could reduce phenotyping costs if they cancelled all sib-tests of the candidates in one generation  like in EVERY-2GEN. In many salmon breeding schemes  most traits are actually measured on the sibs of the candidates  and phenotypic testing for all these disease and slaughter tests constitute a large part of the cost of the breeding program. However  the reduction of the sib-testing reduces <U+0394>G by 16% from 3.80 s for EVERY-GEN to 3.19 s for EVERY-2GEN. FIRST-GEN reduces <U+0394>G even more. An alternative is to use field data   slaughter house data or practical disease outbreaks  to estimate the association between markers and phenotypes. The data must come from the population under selection and represent animals closely related to the selection candidates  because Figure  shows that since the relationship between test individuals and individuals whose EBV are estimated decreases  the accuracy of selection decreases. (iii) Genotyping all selection candidates   100 families times 30 candidates per family = 3000 individuals  is probably not feasible in practice. Instead  pre-selection on  growth and maybe other traits could be a way to reduce the number of candidates to be genotyped. However  this pre-selection step needs to be optimised  in order to get the desired weight on the traits in the pre-selection step relative to the other traits. Also the sib-tested individuals need to be genotyped in the breeding scheme presented. Here the number of genotypes could probably be reduced by a factor of 5 without a substantial loss of accuracy of selection using a selective genotyping strategy []. The results show that the accuracy of selection is mainly affected by the following parameters of the breeding scheme: 1. In general  accuracies are highly affected by the number of generations with information on marker effects. For the basic scheme  with 3000 selection candidates  3000 tested sibs of the candidates  100 full-sib families and a trait heritability of 0.4  accuracy of selection increased from 0.647 to approximately 0.823 over generations for EVERY-GEN. When sib-testing was only in generation 1  as in the FIRST-GEN in order to reduce costs  accuracy of selection dropped rapidly and was only 0.304 in generation 5 for the basic scheme. 2. Genomic selection  using EVERY-GEN  showed a higher accuracy of selection than the theoretical maximum of 0.71 of a conventional sib-testing scheme. 3. After generation 1  the Bulmer effect will reduce the genetic variance  which indirectly reduces the accuracy of selection. The accuracy of selection increases when more information on the marker effects becomes available over generations  and this effect is larger in the selection scheme than in the random selection scheme  probably because the favourable alleles become more abundant and are thus more accurately estimated. Therefore  the accuracy of selection in generation 5 for genomic selection (0.823) is similar to the accuracy of selection for random selection (0.811) in generation 5 for the basic scheme. 4. Increasing Ntested from 3000 to 6000 increased accuracy of selection in generation 5 from 0.823 to 0.845. With a lower heritability of 0.1  the effect of increasing Ntested from 3000 to 6000 (not shown previously)  increased the accuracy of selection in generation 5 from 0.742 to 0.763. Hence  the increase in accuracy of selection was similar. 5.The reduction in accuracy of selection with FIRST-GEN was somewhat larger for the lowest marker density than for the two other marker densities. The results using the current sib-breeding design of family-based aquaculture breeding schemes  which was not optimised in any way for genomic selection  show that genomic selection yields high genetic gain  accuracy of selection and very low rates of inbreeding  which makes it a promising selection scheme. Various strategies were evaluated to reduce the amount of sib-testing and genotyping  to reduce costs  but all resulted in loss of the accuracy of selection and thus of genetic gain. Genotyping costs may also remain high in a near future  and further research on strategies to reduce the number of fish to genotype is highly needed.

The eight SNP  which were located within five genes: µ-calpain ()  calpastatin ()  leptin ()  growth hormone receptor () and acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 ()  are included in various commercial tests for tenderness  fatness  carcass composition and milk yield/quality.MethodsA total of 27 traits were examined  19 relating to carcass quality  such as carcass weight and fatness  one mechanical measure of tenderness  and the remaining seven were sensory traits  such as flavour and tenderness  assessed by a taste panel.ResultsAn SNP in the  gene    was significantly associated with tenderness measured by both the tenderometer and the taste panel as well as the weight of the hindquarter  where animals inheriting the CC genotype had more tender meat and heavier hindquarters. An SNP in the leptin gene    significantly affected overall liking  where animals with the TT genotype were assigned higher scores by the panellists. The SNP in the  gene was significantly associated with odour  where animals inheriting the AA genotype produced steaks with an intense odour when compared with the other genotypes.

The eight SNP  which were located within five genes: µ-calpain ()  calpastatin ()  leptin ()  growth hormone receptor () and acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 ()  are included in various commercial tests for tenderness  fatness  carcass composition and milk yield/quality. A total of 27 traits were examined  19 relating to carcass quality  such as carcass weight and fatness  one mechanical measure of tenderness  and the remaining seven were sensory traits  such as flavour and tenderness  assessed by a taste panel. An SNP in the  gene    was significantly associated with tenderness measured by both the tenderometer and the taste panel as well as the weight of the hindquarter  where animals inheriting the CC genotype had more tender meat and heavier hindquarters. An SNP in the leptin gene    significantly affected overall liking  where animals with the TT genotype were assigned higher scores by the panellists. The SNP in the  gene was significantly associated with odour  where animals inheriting the AA genotype produced steaks with an intense odour when compared with the other genotypes. Finally  the SNP in the  gene was associated with sirloin weight after maturation and fat depth surrounding the sirloin  with animals inheriting the AA genotype having heavier sirloins and more fat. The results of this study confirm some previously documented associations. Furthermore  novel associations have been identified which  following validation in other populations  could be incorporated into breeding programmes to improve meat quality. Meat quality is of great importance to the beef industry where the consumer is willing to pay more for superior products []. Traditional trait improvement has centred on quantitative genetics  using statistical analysis of phenotypic data to determine animals with the highest genetic merit []. This selection approach is most effectively implemented for highly heritable traits that are easily recorded before reproductive age. However  meat quality traits can usually only be measured post-slaughter and often have low heritabilities []  therefore making progress using direct measurement is difficult for these traits. Marker-assisted selection has the potential to significantly increase the rate of genetic improvement in such traits []  using markers linked to economically relevant traits  which can be used to predict the genetic merit of an animal. Several such markers have been identified in the last decade. These include markers based on polymorphisms in the leptin () gene  involved in the control of appetite and energy metabolism  which have been shown to be associated with carcass fat [–]  body weight []  and growth rate []; polymorphisms in the µ-calpain () and calpastatin () genes  which are known to play a key role in post mortem tenderisation of meat and have been associated with meat tenderness [–]; and polymorphisms in the bovine growth hormone receptor () gene  which have been associated with drip loss []  body weight [  ] and marbling score []. Before such marker information can be used in breeding programmes  it is important that unbiased and independent validation studies in different breeds are carried out to establish whether observable effects are found in the breed/population under selection. The aim of this study was to test such associations between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from five different genes and meat quality traits in a sample of Aberdeen Angus-cross animals collected in Scotland. All the tested SNP have been previously reported to be associated with various carcass and meat quality traits in cattle or pigs and have been incorporated into commercially available tests for meat or milk quality. Commercial crossbred beef cattle (n = 443 animals) with purebred Aberdeen Angus sires were sourced through the Scotbeef abattoir (Bridge of Allan  Scotland). Cattle originated from 14 breeder finisher farms (. farms where animals are bred and finished on the same farm) and were selected to be representative of British commercial cattle slaughtered for beef production  being a mix of heifers and steers ranging between 408 and 912 days old at kill  with the age differences depending largely on the farm. The 443 animals used in the experiment included 135 females and 308 males. The sires for all animals were pure-bred Aberdeen Angus whilst the dams were a mixture of purebreds of various breeds and crossbreeds including Aberdeen Angus  Aberdeen Angus-cross  Simmental-cross and Limousin-cross. Cattle were stunned by captive bolt before being slaughtered by exsanguination and dressed using standard commercial specifications. During exsanguination  100 mL blood was collected and frozen for DNA extraction. At slaughter  hot carcass weight was recorded and carcasses were graded by a Meat Hygiene Service assessor for muscle composition and carcass fatness according to the standard European Union beef carcass classification scale (EUROP) []. Conformation and fat class scores were transformed into a 7-point numerical scale []. Twenty-four hours after slaughter  pH and temperature were recorded in the sirloin muscle with the TESTO 205 pH meter (TESTO  Hampshire  UK) and ETI FPT thermometer (ETI Ltd. Worthing  UK)  respectively. At deboning  weight of the hindquarter and sirloins were recorded. Sirloins were vacuum-packed and stored below 4°C for 21–30 d to mature  then removed from the vacuum pack  patted dry to remove excess moisture and weighed. Three steaks were cut from the centre of the sirloin as follows: for tenderometer testing 3–4 cm thick  for sirloin measurements 1–2 cm thick and for sensory testing 2 cm thick. For tenderometer testing  steaks were trimmed to 200–220 g of eye muscle and placed in a water bath at 100°C until the centre of the sample reached 82°C. Samples were left to cool to 7°C then tested using a MIRINZ Tenderometer machine (AgResearch  Hamilton  New Zealand). A full list of analysed carcass quality traits can be found in Table . Taste panel members were chosen among workers at the Scotbeef meat processing plant in East Kilbride  Scotland. Members of staff (n = 38) were tested using the Triangle and Matching tests [] with 10 being discarded due to poor scores. Taste panels included six members and an average of nine samples were tested in one sitting with the addition of one blind repeat steak per panel. Participants were instructed to rinse their mouths with water before tasting began as well as between samples. They were also instructed not to eat or drink for one hour prior to the test. Prior to assessment sirloin steaks were cooked using a Lincat Lynx 400 electric griddle (Lincat Ltd  Lincoln  UK) until a thermometer placed in the centre of the steak reached 74°C. The six panellists then scored the steaks on a 1–8 scale for seven sensory traits  a full list of which can be seen in Table  along with an explanation of the scoring scheme used. In total there were 49 taste panel sittings. Taste panel members participated in one to 37 panels with an average of eight sittings per panellist. Due to the possibility of multiple sire mating and discrepancies between the recorded and the true sire  paternity was determined using genetic markers. Details are described in full in: Gill  Matika  Williams  Worton  Wiener  and Bishop: Consistency statistics and genetic parameters for taste panel assessed meat quality traits in a commercial population of Angus-sired beef cattle (submitted). Briefly  genotypes were obtained for each sample for a panel of 15 unlinked microsatellite markers. Genotypes for each offspring and all possible sires were analyzed with the program Cervus []  which assigns paternity using a likelihood method. There were 69 offspring whose sires could not be determined  therefore the sire was set to \"unknown\" in the pedigree  however  the phenotypes of these samples were retained in the analyses. Samples were genotyped at eight SNP from five different genes by Orchid Cellmark Ltd (Oxfordshire  UK). The SNP locations in each gene  Genbank accession number and the positions (intron/exon etc) are listed in Table . In brief the genes were  (2 SNP)   (1 SNP)  leptin (3 SNP)   (1 SNP)  and acylCoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 () (1 dinucleotide substitution). All animals with phenotypes were genotyped  as were all available sires. A single PCR was used to generate 12 amplicons. Each 10 µL reaction volume contained 5 µL DNA  100 µM of each dNTP  1 × QIAGEN PCR buffer which contained 1.5 mM MgCl  1× primer mix  1 U Hot Start Taq (QIAGEN  UK) and 0.1 µg/µL BSA. PCR conditions consisted of 15 min at 95°C followed by 32 cycles of 30 s as 94°C  1 min at 67°C and 1 min at 72°C. Following amplification  4 µL of a solution containing 4 U Exonuclease I (NEB  UK)  1.4 µL of 10× Antarctic Phosphatase buffer (NEB  UK) and 2 U Antarctic Phosphatase (NEB  UK) was added to the PCR product. Samples were then incubated for 60 min at 37°C followed by 15 min at 72°C. SNaPshot (Applied Biosystems  UK) reactions included 5 µL of Antarctic Phosphatase/Exonuclease I treated PCR product  2 µL of SNaPshot Multiplex Ready Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems  UK)  2 µL HO and 1 µL probe mix. Thermocycling conditions consisted of 30 s at 94°C and 20 s at 67°C. Following single base extension  4 µL of CIP solution containing 0.4 µL of 10× NEBuffer 3 (NEB  UK)  and 2 U CIP (NEB  UK) was added to each sample. The samples were then incubated at 37°C for 60 min followed by 85°C for 20 min. Five µL of the SNaPshot/CIP product was added to 10 µL of Hi-Di™ formamide (Applied Biosystems  UK) and the samples were electrophoresed on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems  UK). Genemapper v4.0 was used to interpret the genetic profiles. Genotype frequencies of each polymorphism were tested for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by  tests [] (significance based on  < 0.05). Pairwise genotype combinations of the SNP were also tested for linkage disequilibrium (LD)  the degree of non-random association of alleles at two or more loci  using the Haploview program  version 4 []. The Haploview program uses a two-marker EM to estimate the maximum-likelihood values of the four gamete frequencies as well as D' and   values and LOD scores. The relationship between the different genotypes of each SNP and the various traits recorded was evaluated using a single-marker mixed-model association analysis. Data were analyzed by fitting a linear mixed model using the restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) provided in Genstat  release 10 []. The statistical model included fixed effects of farm  genotype  sex and the genotype-sex interaction  and random effects of sire  slaughter date (panel date for the taste panel traits)  interaction of sire and slaughter date (panel date for the taste panel traits) and interactions of sire and slaughter date (panel date for the taste panel traits) with the genotype/sex groups. These latter interactions took into account the possibility of genotype/sex effects varying with sire or slaughter date (panel date for the taste panel traits) or both. An additional term including animal ID and steak ID (A or B) was added for analysis of taste panel traits to allow a distinction to be made between the A and B steaks of those animals that had repeat steaks tested. The general model used for carcass traits was as follows: where: Yis the trait measured on the individual i µ is the overall mean for the trait Fis the fixed effect of farm  (14 levels) Gis the fixed effect of SNP genotype  (3 levels) Sis the fixed effect of sex  (2 levels) (G × S)is the interaction between the k-th SNP genotype and the l-th sex Kis the random effect of kill-date  Mis the random effect of the n-th sire on the j-th farm eis the residual term associated with the observation Additional interaction terms between sire  kill-date  genotype and sex groupings were fitted as random effects. Variance components were constrained to be non-negative  . where effects were estimated to be negative they were set to zero. For the taste panel traits the general model was as follows: where additional terms are: Pis the random effect of taste panel date  Tis the random effect of the o-th steak (A or B) for the i-th animal eis the residual error associated with the observation. Again  additional interaction terms between sire  taste panel date  genotype and sex groupings were fitted as random effects  and variance components were constrained to be non-negative. The effects of several covariates (percentage Aberdeen Angus  hot carcass weight and age at kill) were also examined in separate analyses. The percentage Aberdeen Angus (% AA) was based on dam breed so that each animal was assigned a value of 100% (if the dam was AA)  75% (if the dam was AA-cross) or 50% (if the dam was neither). Statistical significance for the fixed effects was determined using approximate F-statistics with denominator degrees of freedom [] estimated in the Genstat REML procedure. Additive effects and dominance deviation were also calculated using a re-parameterized model. The additive effect was estimated as the difference between the mean of the two homozygotes divided by two  and dominance was estimated as the deviation of the heterozygote from the mean of the two homozygotes []. To allow correction for the fact that a large number of traits were analysed with a large number of SNP  and hence a high probability of false positive results  a Bonferroni correction was applied. The three leptin SNP and the two µ-calpain SNP were found to be in partial or strong LD so that the effective number of SNP tested was estimated as five. The correction for multiple SNP testing resulted in an adjusted  value of 0.01 for the 5% significance level. Haplotypes were reconstructed for the genes that contained more than one SNP using software that determines the gametic haplotypes for each animal where phase is known with certainty [] based on sire and sibling genotype information. Haplotype pairs were unambiguously reconstructed for 258 individuals for SNP in the leptin gene and 291 individuals for SNP in the  gene out of the 443 genotyped animals. In order to determine whether the haplotype information accounted for additional variation beyond the SNP genotype analysis  we nested the haplotype group (a combination of the two haplotypes) within a SNP model . the model was the same as the genotype model but with additional fixed terms accounting for the variation between the haplotype groups within the SNP groups in the fixed model. This analysis was carried out for each of the traits found to be significantly affected by either the µ-calpain or leptin SNP  . tenderometer  weight of hindquarter and tenderness for the µ-calpain markers and overall liking for the leptin markers. Statistical significance of the extra variation accounted for by the presence of the haplotype groups in the model was determined using approximate F-statistics derived from Wald statistics with denominator degrees of freedom estimated in the Genstat REML procedure []. A total of 443 animals were genotyped at all eight SNP  however  successful genotype assignment was not possible for all animals  in particular for the leptin SNP  where 17 animals were missing genotypes (Table ). The frequencies of genotypes at all eight SNP were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium []. The two SNP in the  gene and the three SNP in the leptin gene were found to be in LD with D' above 0.62 for each SNP pair combination. R values between each pair of leptin SNP were above 0.18 whilst the value between the two  SNP was 0.07. An analysis of the phenotypic trait data is presented in full in: Gill  Matika  Williams  Worton  Wiener  and Bishop: Consistency statistics and genetic parameters for taste panel assessed meat quality traits in a commercial population of Angus-sired beef cattle (submitted)  including consideration of the reliability of taste panel measurements and genetic parameters for traits of interest. In brief  a total of 27 traits were measured  seven of which are taste panel assessed sensory traits  one a mechanical measure of tenderness with the remaining 19 being carcass and sirloin measurements. Trait means  coefficients of variation and heritability estimates are given in Tables  and . Genotypes for four of the eight SNP tested did not significantly influence any of the 27 traits measured and 20 of the traits were not affected by the genotypes of any of the SNP tested. Tenderometer score  sirloin weight after maturation  sirloin fat depth  hindquarter weight  odour  overall liking and tenderness showed significant additive effects of at least one of the remaining four SNP. At the  gene SNP    the C allele was associated with reduced tenderometer values  increased hindquarter weight and an increase in taste panel assessed tenderness compared to the G allele (Table ). The estimated differences between the homozygous genotypes CC and GG were 2.93 kPa  3.83 kg and 0.37 taste panel units for shear force  hindquarter weight and taste panel tenderness respectively. There were no significant dominance effects seen for . The T allele of the leptin SNP   2  was significantly associated with an increase in overall liking  with the estimated difference between the homozygous genotypes TT and CC equal to 0.21 taste panel units (Table ). There was a significant dominance effect ( = 0.01) such that the C allele was dominant to the T allele. For   the A allele was associated with an increase in sirloin weight after maturation and an increase in sirloin fat depth when compared to the G allele (Table ). The estimated differences between the homozygous genotypes AA and GG were 1.17 kg and 4.58 mm for sirloin weight after maturation and sirloin fat depth. There were significant dominance effects for both sirloin weight after maturation and sirloin fat depth ( = 0.02 and 0.01  respectively). Animals with the heterozygous genotype had values close to the homozygous GG animals  indicating a strong degree of dominance of the G allele over the A allele. The A allele of the  SNP was significantly associated with an increase in taste panel-assessed odour  with the estimated difference between the homozygous genotypes AA and TT equal to 0.48 taste panel units (Table ). There was no significant dominance effect. To further investigate the observed associations  a number of covariates were added to the fixed model. These included hot carcass weight  age at kill and percentage Aberdeen Angus (50  75 or 100%  depending on dam breed). Percentage Aberdeen Angus made no difference to the genotypic effects for all of significant traits. As expected  when hot carcass weight was fitted as a covariate  the significance of the associations with weight traits was reduced. Age at kill made no difference to the effects of genotype on tenderness  hindquarter weight  overall liking  sirloin fat depth or odour. The only SNP trait association affected by age at kill was the association between  genotype and sirloin weight after maturation. The p-value increased above 0.05 although animals with the AA genotype were still found to have heavier sirloins after maturation than those animals with either AT or TT genotypes. Most age differences between animals are accounted for in the model as farm effects  hence the small impact of this covariate. There were significant genotype-by-sex interactions for six of the significant trait SNP genotype pairs (Table ). These were the  association with tenderometer  weight of hindquarter and taste panel tenderness; the  association with odour; and the  association with complete sirloin weight and sirloin fat depth. When the genotype means of each sex were assessed using pair wise comparisons it became apparent that the majority of significant genotype-trait associations mentioned previously were stronger in the female animals. Females with the CC genotype at the  SNP had significantly lower tenderometer values  higher hindquarter weights and higher taste panel tenderness scores than CG or GG animals. In contrast  the CC males had higher tenderometer values than the other genotypes although this difference was not significant. Additionally there was a significant difference in odour score assigned to female animals with the AA  AT and TT genotypes at the  SNP. Here  AA animals had significantly higher scores than either AT or TT animals. For the male animals  those with the TT genotype received the highest score for odour  although again  the differences between genotypes were not significant. Finally  female animals with the AA genotype at the  SNP had significantly heavier sirloins after maturation and sirloin fat depths than AG or GG animals. For males the AA animals also had heavier sirloins although the GG animals had higher values of fat depth  however  differences between genotypes were not significant. Haplotypes with a frequency of = 0.01 were excluded from the analysis; this left four haplotypes for SNP in the  gene (CC  CG  TC and TG (  ))  and four haplotype possibilities for SNP in the leptin gene (CCT  CTT  TCC and TTT ()) (Table ). Results from the nested haplotype model for each of the significant µ-calpain and leptin traits are shown in Table . In all cases F-statistics were not significant and  in fact  close to unity  showing that haplotype information does not account for additional variation compared to a model with only genotype information. The primary objective of this study was to test previously identified associations between SNP from five genes and economically important meat quality traits. The SNP tested are located in the       leptin and  genes and have been incorporated into commercially available genetic tests based on previously reported associations with meat quality or carcass traits. The two  SNP  ( and ) and the  SNP make up the Igenity  GENE panel []  with the two  SNP forming the basis of the GeneSTAR tenderness test []. Additionally  SNP in the leptin gene are included in the Igenity  GRID test  whilst the SNP in the  and  genes comprise the Igenity  YIELD test []. The allele frequencies found for the    and  SNP are in agreement with previous studies [  –]. Allele frequencies were also estimated for the sire population (purebred Aberdeen Angus). On the whole  frequencies in the sire population were found to be similar to those in the progeny  however  at the  SNP  the C allele was found to have a frequency of only 0.10 in the sires (data not shown)  as opposed to 0.22 in the offspring. This is due to the absence of sires with the CC genotype at this SNP. Using single-marker  mixed-model association analysis four of the SNP were found to be associated with one or more of the traits tested in a significantly additive manner. These include the  SNP in the  gene  the  SNP in the leptin gene  the  SNP and the  SNP. The  gene  mapped to BTA 29 []  encodes a cysteine protease thought to be the primary enzyme in the post mortem tenderisation of meat []. It is therefore a prime candidate for association studies involving tenderness  and  indeed  SNP in the gene have previously been associated with the trait in several studies [        ]. In the present study the effects of two SNP located in  were evaluated;   situated in exon 9 of the gene  results in an amino acid substitution from alanine to glycine for the C and G alleles respectively; and   situated in the intron between the 17 and 18 exons of the gene. A significant effect of  genotype was found on the hindquarter weight; animals with the CC genotype at this locus had significantly heavier hindquarters (by 3.8 kg) than GG animals ( = 0.04). However  some of this effect could be explained by effects on overall carcass weight. Additionally  animals inheriting two copies of the C allele at the  SNP had meat that was more tender than animals with one or zero copies  when measured by both the tenderometer machine and the taste panel. The association with mechanical tenderness is consistent with work done in experimental herds of crossbred cattle [  ]. Previous work has shown an association between genotypes at the other  SNP    and WBSF values in an experimental population and a -influenced crossbred population [] where CC animals had significantly lower WBSF values  and therefore more tender meat  than TT animals. The current study did not find a significant effect of genotype at the  SNP on the tenderness trait (although the difference between CC and TT means was in the expected direction). Polymorphisms in   an inhibitor of the  protease mapped to BTA 7 []  have previously been shown to be associated with tenderness [    ]. However  the present study did not find a significant difference in tenderness  measured by the tenderometer machine  between the genotype groups. Three SNP in the leptin gene  which has been mapped to BTA 4 [] and produces a hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of appetite and body composition []  were tested for associations in the present study. In contrast to previous studies [  ]  only one of these    was found to be significantly associated with any of the traits tested. Panellists gave animals with the TT genotype significantly higher overall liking scores than animals with CC or CT genotypes. A significant  non-additive association was also observed between the  SNP and sirloin fat thickness  such that animals inheriting the CC genotype had significantly less fat surrounding the sirloin when compared to either CT or TT animals. This is in line with previous reports where  was significantly associated with both backfat thickness and marbling score  with TT animals having higher values for both traits []. It may be that this association also explains the higher overall liking scores for TT animals as fat composition is known to affect meat flavour. The  gene  which has been mapped to BTA 14 []  plays a key role in triglyceride synthesis []. The SNP studied here is an AA/GC dinucleotide substitution causing a  (lysine) to  (alanine) amino acid substitution () in the protein []. This polymorphism was shown to be significantly associated with milk fat yield and fat percentage where AA animals  with the lysine amino acid  had increased levels for both traits []. The present study found that the polymorphism was also associated with sirloin weight after maturation and sirloin fat depth. In both cases the A allele was associated with the higher value indicating that the increase in sirloin weight is probably due to the increase in the depth of fat surrounding the muscle. This is consistent with work done in German Holstein cattle where animals with the lysine allele at  were found to have an increase in intramuscular fat content []. In contrast  work done on Brahman cattle found no association between  genotype and carcass fat traits []. The  polymorphism studied here is an A to T substitution in exon eight of the gene which results in a non-conservative replacement of phenylalanine with a tyrosine residue ( 279) []. Whilst polymorphisms in the  gene (BTA 20 []) have previously been found to be significantly associated with drip loss []  body weight [  ] and USDA marbling score []  the present study found no associations between  genotype and any of the carcass quality traits. The only trait that was significantly affected by  genotype was meat odour as judged by the taste panel. The panellists assigned higher odour scores for animals with the AA genotype  which corresponds to the phenylanine amino acid  when compared to either AT or TT animals. The present study confirmed some well-known associations and identified novel significant trait-genotype associations. However  there were some traits where associations were expected but not observed. Specifically  associations between carcass and sirloin related traits and the SNP in the leptin gene were expected but were not found. Serum levels of the leptin hormone have previously been found to be significantly associated traits such as marbling  backfat depth and kidney  pelvic and heart fat []. Additionally  genotype at the leptin SNP    has been shown to be associated with serum leptin concentration as well as with backfat thickness  marbling score and live weight at slaughter []  carcass marbling score  Longissimus muscle (LM) area and hot carcass weight []  although these results were not confirmed by Schenkel .  (2005). As discussed above  the present study observed a significant  non-additive association between sirloin fat depth and  genotype but no association was found with carcass or sirloin weight related traits. Previous reports also indicate associations between  and fat yield and  with fat and lean yield and grade fat []  however  the current study found no associations between either  or  genotype and any of the traits tested. These contrasting results may be due to the different populations studied and indicate the importance of multiple validation studies in different breeds and populations. The analyses of the mean trait value for each genotype in each sex for those trait-SNP pairs where there were significant sex interactions indicated that  for the majority of associations  the effect was primarily in the female animals. Differences between male and female genotype effects were seen in five traits: taste panel assessed tenderness  weight of hindquarter  odour  sirloin weight after maturation and sirloin fat depth. The reason for the difference between male and female animals is unknown. Whilst differences in meat quality between male and female cattle have been reported [  ]  there are few that describe differences in genetic effects between sexes such as those seen in the current study. Differences could be partly due to the limited number of females (135) in the analysis when compared to the males (308) although allele frequencies for both sexes were similar (data not shown). Alternatively  trait expression could be strongly correlated with fatness. Means for each sex showed that females tended to have higher fat class scores than males (data not shown). Therefore  it is possible the female animals are more likely to express genetic differences in traits that are correlated with fatness. The haplotype analyses tested whether incorporating information on combinations of SNP (for µ-calpain and leptin respectively) led to an improvement over models with only single SNP genotypes. We found that using haplotypes in addition to SNP genotypes in the analysis accounted for no extra variation for any of the SNP/trait combinations. This may be explained by the fact that only one of the SNP from each of the genes (CAPN316 from the µ-calpain gene  and UASMS2 from the leptin gene) had a significant effect on any of the traits in the single SNP analyses. Thus incorporating haplotype information would not improve the performance of marker-assisted selection for this population. The results presented here confirm some of the previously documented associations  for example  the association between  genotype and tenderness  the most important quality trait for consumers. Furthermore  novel associations have been identified which  following validation in other populations  could be incorporated into breeding programmes to improve meat quality. Finally  whilst some previously noted associations were not replicated in the current study  it is important to note that validation is dependent on the specific nature of the population screened and that genetic background may influence the size of the effect of a polymorphism. Validation failure may be due to a lack of true associations between the trait and marker but could also be caused by differences in SNP frequencies  different marker-causative mutation linkage phases  genotype-by-environment interactions or epistasis as well as sample size effects and the way the trait is measured. Nevertheless  for those associations confirmed here  the additional validation instils confidence in using these markers in selection programmes for improved meat quality.

A prediction equation is presented  that predicts accuracy when training and evaluation individuals are related. For humans  1NL requires ~350 000 individuals  which means that human disease risk prediction is possible only for diseases that are determined by a limited number of genes. Otherwise  genotyping and phenotypic recording need to become very common in the future. The Human Genome Project and related projects for other species have generated the complete DNA sequence of many animal  plant  and microbial genomes . An important result from these sequencing efforts is the detection of 100 000's to millions of SNP markers for each of the sequenced species. The availability of all these SNP and recent innovations in high-throughput SNP-chip genotyping technology have made the routine genotyping of huge SNP panels feasible. For example  in human genetics  assays with > 500 000 SNP are routinely used  and in cattle  pigs and sheep ~50 000 SNP chips are commercially available. These dense marker genotypes can be used to predict genome-wide breeding values using genomic selection (e.g. [  ]). Genomic selection consists of the following steps: (i) estimation of the effects of all markers in a 'training data set'  where the individuals are phenotyped and genotyped; (ii) prediction of the breeding values of other 'evaluation' individuals by combining their marker genotypes with the estimates obtained in step (i). These steps implicitly assume that there is substantial linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers and the QTL  and  ideally  for every QTL there is a marker in perfect LD  i.e. R = 1  where R is the square of the correlation between the allele frequencies at two loci. Habier . [] have demonstrated that breeding values can also be predicted in the absence of linkage between markers and QTL  since the markers can predict family relationships between the individuals. However  substantial LD requires strong linkage  especially for the prediction of unrelated individuals  and thus dense marker genotyping. The ideal of having a marker in perfect LD with each QTL is complicated by the fact that recently  it has been shown in human genetics studies  that nearly all the genetic variation of quantitative traits is due to genes with a small effect []. This implies that (i) there are very many QTL  and thus that the effect of a single marker may be due to a number of QTL in the region; (ii) the estimation of single gene effects will be complicated by their small size and LD with other genes; (iii) assuming a constant genetic variance across the genome when estimating marker effects may be quite realistic  as was shown by Visscher . [] for height in humans. The latter favours the BLUP model for the estimation of marker effects relative to non-linear models  which give more weight to positions that appear to have large effects (e.g. the BayesB model []). In the step estimating marker effects  the estimation of effects of very many markers is hampered by the LD  i.e. collinearity  between the marker effects. Fortunately  similar combinations of marker alleles will be found in the evaluation data set (step (ii))  especially if the individuals of steps (i) and (ii) are related (e.g. parents and offspring as in []). The latter implies that it is not necessary to estimate the effect of single markers accurately  as long as the effects of distinct haplotypes are estimated accurately by summing the effects of their marker alleles. The prediction of breeding values of 'unrelated' individuals is a particularly poor case  since the haplotypes in the evaluation data set can be very different from those in the training data set. Here  'unrelated' individuals means that they are from the same population  but not structurally related to the training data individuals. However  the prediction of breeding values of unrelated individuals is exactly what is required in many and perhaps the most promising applications of genomic selection  for example when using field data to predict breeding values of elite breeding stocks  the selection of individuals for markers whose effects were estimated in an experiment on a unrelated subset of individuals  and in the case of genetic risk prediction for human diseases []. The aim of this study is to assess whether the breeding values of unrelated individuals could be predicted with high accuracy  and what resources are required in terms of marker density and number of records in the training data set. The results are based on computer simulations of relatively small populations  but will be generalised using the scaling by effective size (N) argument from coalescence theory [  ]. From the coalescence theory it is well known that  for a population in recombination-drift equilibrium  the LD between marker and QTL and amongst markers is a function of N*c  where c is the recombination rate between the loci and N is the effective population size. For instance  the LD structure will be the same for a population with N = 100 and 1000 SNPs per Morgan (M)  compared to a population with N = 1000 and 10 000 SNPs per M  i.e. for both populations  the marker density is 10 * N /M []. However  the second population requires the estimation of 10 times as many markers  which may be achieved with a similar accuracy if we have 10 times as many training data. The latter is also seen from recent predictions of the accuracy of selection [–]: where  is accuracy of selection; N is the number of phenotypic training records; h is the trait heritability; L is genome size in Morgan; 4  is the effective number of QTL loci in the genome  which each equals the effective number of segments in the genome when the infinitesimal model is assumed (. BLUP is used for the estimation of SNP effects). In the latter case  <U+03BD> may be interpreted as the ratio of the effective number of segments and the actual number of segments  which is expected to be 4 . Goddard [] derived that the effective number of segments is   where summation is over the chromosomes and L is the size of chromosome i. From this scaling argument and Equation () it is also seen that as genome size doubles  we need twice as many training records (N) to achieve a similar accuracy of predicting breeding value  assuming a constant marker density. Whether the latter expectation holds will be tested in the Results and Discussion section. Also  the LD structure between the QTL is equivalent if the number of QTL per M is 100 and 1000 in populations with N = 100 and 1000  respectively. In order to reduce computer time  the effective size used in the simulations described here will be quite low (N = 100)  but the scaling argument makes it possible to extend the results to bigger population sizes. The use of a relatively low N does not only reduce the population size to be simulated  but also the number of generations needed to reach equilibrium between mutation  drift and recombination. This is because lineages coalesce faster in small populations. In general  the model for the population history mimics that of coalescence simulations []  however a forward simulation approach is used because this increases the size of the chromosomes that can be handled. Following the coalescence theory  the Fisher-Wright idealised population model [] and the infinite-sites mutation model were assumed []  with a mutation frequency of 2*10 per nucleotide per generation. The latter ensured a large number of SNP. The historical effective size of the population was N = 100  and the forward simulations were conducted for 400 generations. The latter is expected to result in a mutation-drift balance  since any sample of alleles at a locus is expected to coalesce into its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within 200 (= 2N) generations. Any mutations before this MRCA lived do not cause a polymorphism (since all present alleles would be of the mutant type). Preliminary simulations showed that an approximate mutation-drift balance was reached before 400 generations (result not shown). Recombinations were sampled according to the Haldane mapping function. The genome consisted of 10 chromosomes of 50 cM each  i.e. the total genome size was 5 M. After these 400 generations  SNP with a Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) < 0.02 were discarded. From the remaining SNP  12 were randomly selected per chromosome to become a QTL  which resulted in a total of 120 QTL. From the remaining  non-QTL SNP  the 1000 SNP per chromosome with the highest MAF were selected to become a marker. This resulted in a total of 10 000 markers  and a density of 20 N/M. For humans  this density corresponds to a total of ~2.3 million markers (= 20*38*3 000; assuming a genome of 38 M []  and N ~3 000 [])  and for cattle 600 000 markers (assuming a 30 M genome and N~1 000). Smaller marker densities of 20/x N/M were obtained by taking every x-th marker from the original set of 10 000 markers  where x = 2  4  10 or 20. After these 400 generations  the population was increased to 1000 by sampling parents from the previous generations for 1000 individuals  which formed generation G0. Generation G0 was split into 500 G0t and 500 G0e individuals (e and t indicate that they become the 'evaluation' and 'training' line  respectively). The 500 G0e-individuals were used for the sampling of parents for 500 G1e individuals  and similarly the G0t-individuals were used for the sampling of parents for 500 G1t individuals. Setting up different lines for the sampling of the G1e and the G1t individuals ensured that these two groups of individuals shared no close relationships. Subsequently  parents of 100 G2e individuals were sampled at random (with replacement) from the 500 G1e individuals. Similarly  parents of N G2t individuals were sampled from the 500 G1t individuals  where N was 500  1000 or 2000. The G2t individuals were used for the estimation of marker effects  . they were genotyped and phenotyped. The 100 G2e individuals are only genotyped  and their genetic value is to be predicted. The G0e  G0t  G1e  G1t  G2e and G2t individuals were pedigree recorded  i.e. for the pedigree recording the parents of G0 were treated as founders. The 'training' individuals (G2t) had neither parents nor grandparents in common with the evaluation individuals (G2e) due to the separation of the two lines. The results were based on 16 replicated simulations  which was computationally advantageous  since the 16 replicates could be run in parallel. Figure  summarises the population structure. .

An additive genetic model was assumed  and the allelic effect of the mutant QTL allele at locus j  u  was sampled from the exponential distribution  and u was given a negative sign with probability 0.5. The total genetic value of individual i was calculated as: where q is the number of mutant alleles (0  1  or 2) that individual i carries at locus j. At the end of the 400 generations of simulation  the allelic effects were standardised so that the total genetic variance was 1. Phenotypes for the G2t individuals were obtained by adding an environmental effect sampled from N(0 0.25) to their genetic value. This resulted in a high heritability of 0.8. The effect of a lower heritability is investigated in the Results and Discussion section. Estimation of marker effects was performed using three models: (i) BLUP of marker effects  which assumes that every marker effect has a constant variance (G-BLUP); (ii) BayesB  which estimates the variance of every marker using a prior distribution and Bayesian methodology []; and (iii) MIXTURE  which assumes that the marker effects come from a mixture of two normal distributions  which differ in variance  i.e. the large marker effects are accommodated by the distribution with large variance and vice versa. The MIXTURE model was used because it  in a relatively simple way  approximates the prior distribution of the marker effects  assuming that any prior distribution can be reasonably well approximated by a mixture of normal distributions []. Some preliminary testing of the MIXTURE model showed that a mixture of two normal distributions is sufficient. The prior distribution of BayesB of [] assumed that some markers had a big effect  the variance of which was estimated (a fraction N/N of markers)  whilst the remaining markers did not have an effect at all  where N is the number of QTL and N is the number of markers fitted. However  in the BayesB model implemented here  the prior distribution assumed that the majority of the markers (i.e. the fraction 1- N/N) did have a small effect  the variance of which was assumed equal and was estimated in the model  instead of assuming that these markers had no effect at all (as in []). The latter has two advantages: (i) a Gibbs-sampling algorithm can be implemented  which reduces computer time; and (ii) since there were many QTL  they will probably not be all clearly detected by a single marker  such that a proportion of the genetic variance will be picked up by allowing for many  small marker effects. The statistical model used to estimate the marker effects by G-BLUP  BayesB  and MIXTURE was: where  is a Nx1 vector of phenotypes; a is the effect of marker j; is a Nx1 vector denoting the genotype of the individuals for marker j  where 0 denotes homozygous for the first allele; 1/vH denotes heterozygous; 2/vH denotes homozygous for the second allele  and H is the marker heterozygosity. The vH term in standardises the variance of the marker genotype data to 1. The variance of a is assumed to be 1/N for G-BLUP  is estimated by BayesB  and  in MIXTURE it equals s or s  depending on whether the marker effect is small or large. The probability of a small or large marker effect is estimated together with the variances of the small and large distribution of marker effects  s and s. Given the estimates of the marker effects and the marker genotypes  genetic values for the individuals in set G2e are predicted as: where X is the marker genotype of individual i for marker j coded the same as above; and  is the estimate of marker effect j. The accuracy of this prediction is calculated as the correlation between  and  for the G2e individuals. Traditional BLUP (T-BLUP []) breeding values are estimated based on the phenotypes of the individuals in G2t and the pedigree of the G0  G1t  G1e  G2t  and G2e individuals using the ASREML package []. From Equation () it may be expected that a doubling of the genome size requires twice as many records. To test this expectation  we compared the situation of a genome with 5 chromosomes with N = 500 G2t individuals  to 10 chromosomes with N = 1000  and to 20 chromosomes with N = 2000. Marker density was kept constant at 20 N/M. Following Habier . []  the accuracy of G-BLUP may be split into a component due to genomic selection and a component that could also be predicted by T-BLUP  i.e.: where r (r) is the accuracy using G-BLUP (T-BLUP)  (1-r) denotes the inaccuracy of r  and <U+03C1> is the proportion of the inaccuracy that could be explained by G-BLUP. Since  r and r are known  <U+03C1>can be calculated from the simulation results and Equation (). Using these <U+03C1> values  a method to predict the accuracies from traditional BLUP (e.g. [])  and Equation ()  we can predict r in situations where there may be very different relationships between the training and evaluation individuals  than assumed in the presented simulations. Similarly  the accuracy of BayesB can be predicted for different relationships between training and evaluation individuals. To test these predictions  a simulation was conducted where the training data set was composed of G1t individuals  the number of which was increased to N  and the evaluation individuals originated from G1e. Hence  the training and evaluation individuals were two generations less separated (one generation in each of the lines). By combining the simulation results and Equation ()  the effective number of segments can be derived as follows. Let PEV = 1-r  then it can be seen from Equation () that the E(PEV) = 1+ß*N  where . Hence  the regression of PEV on N is linear  and the regression coefficient is a function of h  which is known  and the effective number of segments  4NL<U+03BD>. Figure  shows the accuracy of the predicted breeding values of the G2e individuals  as a function of the marker density expressed in terms of the linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers (following Calus . []). The linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers was calculated as R = 1/(4Nd+1) []  where d is the distance between the adjacent markers. As can be seen from Figure   accuracy increases approximately linearly with |R| over a 20-fold increase in marker density. However  increasing the density from 10 to 20 N/M hardly increased the accuracy of selection (and also the |R| between adjacent markers). For G-BLUP  the slope of the increase with increasing density was clearly smaller  which indicates that the superiority of BayesB increases with increasing density. This may be expected since with increasing density it becomes more important to filter the SNP that are in strong LD with the QTL from all the others  instead of spreading the effects over all SNP as G-BLUP does  which results in very small effects for the single SNP. . The markers shown from left to right are at densities of 1  2  5  and 10 Ne/M. The differences between BayesB and MIXTURE are very small (Table )  but slightly in favour of BayesB  which is probably due to the informative prior distribution that was used in BayesB. G-BLUP yielded clearly lower accuracy at high density  which was especially the case for low N. This may be explained by the fact that as N goes to infinity all methods will reach perfect predictions of SNP effects  as can be seen from Equation (). At low density (1 N/M) G-BLUP yielded only a 0.02–0.06 fold lower accuracy than BayesB. For T-BLUP  the accuracies varied between 0.19 and 0.23 as N increased from 500 to 2000 (result not shown elsewhere). Thus T-BLUP was much less accurate than BayesB (varied from 0.83 – 0.93) because (i) it does not make use of the marker data; and (ii) it uses pedigree-based relationships to predict the EBV of the evaluation individuals from the phenotyped of the training individuals which were generally low  on average 0.01. The accuracy of G-BLUP increases more than that of BayesB when the number of records increases (Figure ). Thus  G-BLUP requires more records  N  to achieve high accuracy than BayesB. In other words  BayesB seems especially superior to G-BLUP in situations with small numbers of records and high marker density. In these situations  the prior knowledge about QTL effects used by BayesB partly overcomes the low information content of the data  and the high marker density results in marker effects reflecting better the effects of QTL. The effect of increasing the number of records  N  is smaller at low marker densities  especially for G-BLUP at density 1 Ne/M. For high densities  the accuracy keeps increasing as the number of records increases. Hence  to take advantage of high-density SNP genotyping  large data sets are needed to estimate the marker effects. . Table  shows the effect of doubling the genome size and simultaneously doubling the number of G2t individuals (N). From Equation ()  it was expected that accuracy would not be affected by this doubling. This is approximately the case  but not quite: for G-BLUP the accuracy decreases on average by 0.014 per doubling of genome sizes and for BayesB this figure is on average 0.0075. The mechanics of doubling genome size and numbers of training records may become clearer  if we consider two replicated simulations containing one chromosome each  and obtain an average accuracy of r. Now  if we combine the two chromosomes of the two replicates into one replicate with two chromosomes  it becomes clear that we also have to combine the phenotypic recordings of both replicates to predict marker effects and thus breeding values with the same accuracy. However  2N records on two chromosomes are only as informative as N records on 1 chromosome  if the markers on chromosome 1 are independent to those of chromosome 2 (i.e. a balanced design). The markers on the two chromosomes are independent  but the number of markers is so large that some confounding between the markers of the two chromosomes will still occur by chance. The latter probably resulted in the somewhat reduced accuracy when doubling the genome size and the number of phenotypes. Table  shows the errors of the predictions from Equation ()  when G1t was used as a training and G1e as an estimation data set  using BayesB and G-BLUP and the extremes of the marker densities. The accuracy of T-BLUP increased to 0.342  0.410  and 0.412  for N = 500  1000 and 2000  respectively  for these data sets  which was used in the prediction Equation (). The errors of the predicted accuracies were all smaller than 0.027  and may in part be due to sampling errors from the Monte Carlo simulations. In general  it seems that Equation () provides quite precise predictions of the accuracies for different degrees of relationship between the evaluation and training individuals. The effect of even more distant relationships between training and evaluation individuals was investigated by continuing the breeding of the lines in Figure  for two more generations. This resulted in G4t and G4e individuals  which were separated by four more generations than the G2t and G2e individuals. Using density 20 N/M and 2000 G4t individuals  the accuracy reduced to 0.920 and 0.868 for BayesB and G-BLUP respectively (result not shown elsewhere). These accuracies compare to those in Table   i.e. 0.928 and 0.881  respectively. Thus  the four additional generations of genetic drift  and thus change of LD  did not reduce the accuracies much  especially not for BayesB  which seemed to yield more persistent estimates of SNP effects over generations. Using the results of Table  for a density of 20 N/M  the regression of PEV on N was calculated as suggested in section 'Estimation of the effective number of segments'. For G-BLUP  the estimates of the intercept (a) and slope (ß) were 1.388 and 1.551*10  respectively. For BayesB  these figures were 1.859 and 2.649*10  respectively. This results in estimates of the effective number of QTL of 516 and 302 for G-BLUP and BayesB  respectively. This value is expected to be lower for BayesB  since it concentrates on the loci with substantial effects whereas G-BLUP gives equal weight to all loci. The actual number of QTL was 120  which indicates that BayesB had to use several SNP to estimate the effect of each QTL. The derivation of Goddard [] (see Section 'The scaling by N argument') predicts that there are effectively 189 segments  which is considerably lower than the estimate of 516 by G-BLUP. Possibly the estimate of G-BLUP is biased by the deliberate exclusion of close relationships between the training and evaluation individuals. The estimates of the regression coefficients a and ß can also be used to predict PEV  and thus r and r for different sizes of the training data set  N  than those used here. Using the prediction of 189 effective segments from []  Equation () predicts accuracies of 0.946  0.899  and 0.824  for N = 2000  1000 and 500  respectively. This is reasonably close to the BayesB accuracies  but should in fact be compared to the G-BLUP (which was assumed to derive the 189 effective segments) accuracies  which are substantially lower (Table ; 20 N/M results). This could be due to the training and estimation individuals being less related than when they were randomly sampled from the population. The effect of a reduced heritability was tested using a heritability of 0.5 instead of 0.8. For N = 2000  this yielded accuracies of 0.789 and 0.859 for G-BLUP and BayesB  respectively (result not shown elsewhere). Equation () predicts that accuracy does not change if N*h remains the same  which is approximately the case for N = 1000 and h = 0.8  and yielded accuracies of 0.817 and 0.882 (Table ). Thus  this prediction of Equation () seems to hold approximately  although the accuracy seems to decrease somewhat faster than predicted as h reduces. The latter may be because Equation () predicts basically the accuracy of a single (effective) locus  whereas  if accuracy is high  all other loci are also predicted accurately. If heritability  and thus accuracy is reduced  the accuracy of the other loci reduces as well and the overall accuracy reduces more than expected from single locus predictions. The number of simulated QTL was quite large: 24 per Morgan  i.e. 720 for a 30 Morgan genome. In addition  the effective size was quite small  such that the expected LD between the QTL is substantial  i.e. from []:  where d is the distance between the QTL. This implies that the effect of the previous QTL in part carries over to the next  and thus that there are measurable QTL effects everywhere across the genome. Thus  the genetic model resembles that of the infinitesimal model  which assumes that infinitely many small QTL are smeared across the genome. Results from large-scale genome-wide association studies in humans support this genetic model with relatively small and many QTL []. This genetic model with many  small QTL will especially be a disadvantage for BayesB  which attempts to estimate the variance of individual QTL  whereas G-BLUP a priori assumes that every marker has equal variance. Therefore  the results in Table   show a smaller advantage for BayesB relative to G-BLUP than Meuwissen . [] found  who simulated only ~5 QTL per Morgan. However  in general  BayesB has the advantage of using an informative priori distribution  which agrees well with the simulated distribution of QTL effects. Therefore  an alternative distribution for the QTL effects was also investigated  namely the normal distribution  which makes it harder for BayesB to detect and give extra weight to large QTL (since there are fewer). With N = 2000 and density 20 N/M  the accuracy of selection reduced to 0.914  0.916 and 0.879 for BayesB  MIXTURE and G-BLUP  respectively (result not shown elsewhere). Thus  the effect of normal vs. exponentially distributed QTL effects was small  but larger for BayesB than for G-BLUP as might be expected. Although the difference is small and may well be due to sampling  the MIXTURE model seems to yield the highest accuracy when QTL effects are normally distributed  which may be expected since it attempts to estimate the prior distribution from the data  and the normally distributed QTL effects may be more in accordance with the assumptions underlying the MIXTURE model. The results presented here imply that the accurate prediction of breeding values of unrelated individuals requires a set of ~10*N*L SNP markers and ~2*N*M genotyped and phenotypes training individuals for the estimation of SNP effects. The former requirement is likely to be achieved in species where the genome sequence is available  but the latter will be challenging. If we accept accuracies of 0.7 – 0.8  ~1*N*L training individuals is sufficient. For humans  this still implies ~350 000 training records  which makes the risk prediction for truly polygenic diseases and for unrelated individuals probably impossible unless genotyping and phenotyping for such diseases becomes very common in the future. For cattle  1NL implies N = 30 000. Using Holstein dairy bulls  VanRaden . [] found accuracies of 0.7–0.8 using N = 3 576  but in this situation the training and evaluation bulls were often highly related  and genomic EBVs were combined with T-BLUP EBVs  which were based on a much larger data set. Thus  the aforementioned requirements can be substantially reduced if the training and evaluation individuals are related  and Equation () can be used to predict by how much they can be reduced. Accuracies of ~0.9 for unrelated individuals require 10*Ne*L SNPs and 2*Ne*L training records. For related individuals these requirements can be substantially lowered. Accuracy increases approximately linearly with marker density  when expressed as |R| between adjacent markers. The superiority of BayesB over G-BLUP increases with marker density. BayesB yielded more persistent estimates of SNP effects over generations. As the size of the training data set increases  the difference between G-BLUP and BayesB decreases. To take advantage of high marker densities  large training data sets are needed. The regression of the inverse of the prediction error variance (PEV) on the number of training records (N) is linear  and the regression coefficients can be used to predict the accuracy for different N. The scaling arguments predicted from Equation () hold approximately  but they over-predicted the accuracies found here  perhaps because the training and evaluation individuals were less related than expected.

Over the past few decades  a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses have been conducted on many livestock breeds. These studies have provided very useful genetic information and enriched our knowledge on the underlying biology and genetic architecture of complex traits. A general review of QTL mapping can be found in Weller []. An important input to be considered in QTL studies is the availability of a robust framework map of the genome. The initial work by Crawford et al [] has resulted in the first extensive ovine genetic linkage map covering 2 070 cM of the sheep genome and comprising 246 polymorphic markers []. It has been followed by second [] and third generation updates []. The latest update of the ovine linkage map has been recently published and is available on the Australian Sheep Gene Mapping website []. Several QTL studies have established independent linkage maps to position QTL  e.g Beh et al []  Crawford et al []  Beraldi et al []  Murphey et al [] and Gutierrez-Gil et al []  using independent populations of Merino  Coopworth  Soay  Suffolk  and Churra sheep  respectively. In sheep  growth rate and body mass represent economically important traits  which are under moderate genetic control and respond to directional selection []. Despite extensive background information  relatively few QTL studies have been reported for growth in sheep and furthermore they have been mostly restricted to partial genome scans  limiting the discovery of and reports on new QTL. QTL studies contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis of a biologically complex trait such as growth because they can identify positional candidate genes. Walling et al [] have reported QTL affecting muscle depth and live weight at eight weeks of age in Texel sheep from partial genome scans in candidate gene regions on  chromosome 2 (OAR2) and OAR18. Using candidate regions on OAR1  2  3  5  5  6  11  18 and 20 in Suffolk and Texel commercial sheep populations  Wallinget al [  ] have revealed suggestive QTL for body weight. Based on previous studies in sheep and other livestock species  McRae et al [] have analysed results of partial scans on selected autosomes (OAR1  2  3  18 and 20) and identified QTL for body weight at eight and 20 weeks of age on OAR1. A whole genome linkage study  conducted in an Indonesian Thin Tail × Merino sheep population  has revealed QTL for birth weight on OAR5 and for body weight at yearling on OAR18 []. Combining results from QTL analyses in different livestock species and functional and positional candidate gene studies have shown that the myostatin gene on OAR2  the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene on OAR3  the callipyge gene and the Carwell rib eye muscling locus on OAR18 and the MHC locus on OAR20 are linked to growth or muscularity QTL in sheep and/or cattle [  –]. However  incomplete genome scans and positional candidate gene studies give an incomplete picture of the whole genome and of the location of growth and body weight QTL. In this paper  we report the development of a framework map for male sheep  derived from a paternal half-sib design within an Awassi × Merino resource population. We use this map to search for putative QTL for growth rate and body weight in this resource population. In subsequent papers  we will report other putative QTL for economically important production traits such as milk yield and milk persistency  fleece/wool production  carcass characteristics  reproduction  behaviour  feed intake  and type traits. The range of phenotypes collected during this study is listed in the additional file . As described by Raadsma et al []  a resource population from crosses between Awassi and Merino sheep was established to exploit the extreme differences between these two types of sheep in a range of production characteristics. Awassi sheep is a large-frame fat-tailed breed  which has its origins in the Middle East as a multi-purpose breed for milk  carpet wool and meat production and where it is dominant. From this source  the modern milking Awassi sheep was developed in Israel []  which is the breed used in the present resource. Merino sheep is known for high-quality apparel wool but poor maternal characteristics []. The Australian Merino breed  which is dominant in Australia  was derived from Spanish and Saxon Merinos crossed with meat breeds imported from Capetown and Bengal []. Both super-fine and medium-wool Merinos were used in the present resource: they have a much smaller frame size than the milking Awassi breed and a very different fat distribution. This resource population was developed in three phases  coinciding with different stages of research. A diagrammatic representation of the mating structure is shown in Figure  for one of the sire families and the other families have similar mating structures. In Phase 1  four sires from an imported strain of improved dairy Awassi []  were crossed with 30 super-fine and medium-wool Merino ewes. Four resulting F sires (AM) were backcrossed to 1650 fine and medium-wool Merino ewes  resulting in approximately 1000 generation-2 (G) backcrosses (AMM). In Phase 2  280 AMM G ewes were mated to the four AM F sires so that matings were both within family (F sire mated with his daughters) and across families (F sire mated with daughters of other F sires) to produce approximately 900 G animals (AM_AMM). In Phase 3  280 of the available G ewes were mated to three of the AM F sires (both within and across sire families) to produce G animals (AM_AM_AMM). In addition  four G males (each replacing one of the F sires) were mated to G ewes  resulting in 490 G animals (AM_AMM_AM_AMM). A total of 2 700 progeny were produced over 10 years  representing four generations. A broad range of phenotypes was collected from the progeny  as well as a DNA and tissue (blood  milk  fat  muscle  wool) repository for each available animal. In the initial QTL study reported here  only phenotypic and genotypic information from the G backcross progeny of the first F sire were analysed in detail  as this was the only family where a genome-wide scan was performed. The additional families will be used for confirmation of QTL effects and  when combined with high-density marker analysis  for fine mapping of confirmed QTL. . A = Awassi  M = Merino; in Phases 3 and 4  ewes are brought in from other sire families  shown as the AMM* and AM_AMM*; the other three sire families have similar mating structures  again with cross-family matings in Phases 3 and 4. Progeny were reared in typical Australian paddock conditions for a NSW Southern Tablelands environment. Supplementary feeding occurred at times when feed availability from pasture was limited and corresponded to periods of negative growth (approximately 12 months of age). From 83 to 98 weeks (at which time the growth study was terminated)  only the males were maintained on pasture as a single cohort till separate feed intake and carcass studies were undertaken. Ewes were relocated to a separate farm for lambing and milk recording. DNA was extracted from blood using a modification of the protocol described by Montgomery and Sise []. Purity of all extracted DNA was assessed by calculating the 260/280 nm ratios determined with an Eppendorf BioPhotometer. All DNA samples were dispensed to 96-well plates using a robotic workstation (Beckman Biomek 2000 with integrated MJ research DNA Engine PCR cycler). Two hundred previously published polymorphic microsatellite markers covering all 26 autosomes were used in the construction of the map. They comprised 112 cattle () markers  73 sheep () markers  and 15 other bovidae markers sourced from Prof. Yoshikazu Sugimoto (pers. comm.). All markers were screened for phase-known heterozygosity for the sire genotype. Markers were chosen on their Polymorphic Information Content [] (PIC; > 0.6 if possible)  and ease of scoring. Five hundred and ten animals were genotyped  comprising the Awassi grandsire  the Merino grand dam  and 510 AMM backcross G progeny (246 ewes and 264 wethers). PCR was performed in 10 µL reactions containing 50 ng DNA  1 × PCR buffer  1 × 2.5 mM MgCl  200 µM of each dNTP  0.8 pmol of each forward primer (with M13-29 tail) and reverse primer  0.2 pmol of M13-29 primer labelled with either IRD 700 or IRD800 dye  and 0.5 units of  polymerase. PCR amplifications were carried out using one of the following three MJ Research (Watertown  Massachusetts  USA) 96 well PCR machines  namely  PTC-100  PTC-200  and PTC-200 Gradient Cycler. The touchdown program () was used for the majority of the PCR  and a second program () was used for markers with a lower annealing temperature if amplification was unsuccessful using the  program. The  thermocycler touchdown cycles were as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 95°C  5 cycles of 95°C for 45 s  68°C for 1.5 min (-2°C per cycle)  72°C for 1 min  followed by 4 cycles of 95°C for 45 s  58°C for 1 min (-2°C per cycle)  72°C for 1 min  followed by 25 cycles of 95°C for 45 s  50°C for 1 min  72°C for 1 min and a final 5 min extension at 72°C. The  cycles were as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 95°C  5 cycles of 95°C for 30 s  55°C for 1.5 min  72°C for 45 s  followed by 5 cycles of 95°C for 30 s  50°C for 30 s  72°C for 45 s and a final 5 min extensions at 72°C. Microsatellite PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PAGE) and detected using a Licor 4200 semi-automated sequencer. The following description applies to the genotype scoring of the AMM backcross only as mentioned previously. All genotypes were scored by at least two independent scorers. To facilitate linkage analysis  only the F allele source was scored (Awassi or Merino origin)  rather than the actual allele size. The Awassi allele was scored as '1'  while the Merino allele was scored as '2'  giving a genotype for the F sires. Only the identities of the alleles that were in the F sire were scored in the G AMM backcrosses  their genotypes identified as '1'  '2' or '12'. A score of 1 can be homozygous '11' or 1  where  is not equal to 2. Similarly a score of 2 can be homozygous '22' or 2  where  is not equal to 1. Since information of the maternal allele was not available  heterozygous '12' in the backcross progeny was only semi-informative  as one cannot determine which allele originated from the F sire or from the Merino dam. The QTL mapping methodology used here exploited the semi-informative marker information (additional file ). Using the genotype information from our Awassi-Merino resource population  we generated an independent sheep linkage framework map comprising the 200 microsatellites genotyped in this resource. Carthagene version 4.0 [  ] and Multipoint [] were used for the construction and validation of the map. These two programs use a multipoint maximum likelihood estimation method. Carthagene was used for the initial map construction  and Multipoint was used to test and validate marker orders. Only markers showing consistent results from both programs were included in the final framework map. We used information from the Sheep Linkage Map v4.7 [] to group markers according to their chromosomal location as a prior to the construction of the framework map. Marker ordering and validation were performed for each linkage (chromosome) group separately. A minimum LOD score of 3.0 and a maximum recombination fraction of 0.4 were used as thresholds for linkage and sub-linkage grouping within the same chromosome. The Kosambi map function [] was used to convert recombination fractions to distances. A framework map was considered satisfactory for the marker positions within a linkage group if the LOD score difference between the best and next-best map order was greater than or equal to 3.0. Non-fasted body-weight measurements were taken at weeks 2  15  25  32  37  43  48  50  56  60  67  74  79  and 83 for 510 G AMM backcrosses (246 ewes and 264 wethers). Birth weight was recorded for some animals  and body weights at weeks 90 and 98 were recorded for males only. The analysis of these data indicated distinct changes in growth rate at weeks 43  56  and 86  presumably as a result of seasonal influences. Thus  growth rates were divided into four growth phases: week 0 to week 43  week 43 to week 56  week 56 to week 83  and week 83 to week 98. To accommodate these distinct changes  a piecewise-linear mixed model was used to model growth of each animal. Linear mixed models were fitted with separate slopes in each phase  but constrained to connect at each breakpoint (spline knot). While  arguably  a non-linear growth model may have been more applicable  the major purpose of the modelling was to capture the main features of the growth data. A full description of the piecewise-linear mixed model can be found in the additional file . A maximum likelihood procedure  named QTL-MLE  suitable for the backcross design of the present resource (in which only the paternal allele was identified in G animals) was developed and programmed using R [] by one of us (PCT). The software allows easy modification for the identification of QTL for most types of traits  including binary (e.g disease presence-absence)  ordinal (e.g 5-point disease severity scale)  or survival-time traits. Details of the algorithm are provided below  in terms of the models used to analyze body weight and growth data. For a normally distributed trait  a linear model may be appropriate  . = ß'x+ <U+03B3>+ e  where = observed trait value of animal    = 1  ... ; x= set of covariates and fixed effects for animal ; ß = corresponding set of regression parameters; <U+03B3> = sire family allelic QTL effect ( relative to ); = unobserved QTL allele of animal   = 1 if   0 if ; and e= random error  assumed (0 s). Note the Merino dam effects will be absorbed into this last term. The genotype of the F sire is assumed to be   with  originating from the Awassi line and  from the Merino line. Since there are only two types of QTL alleles in backcross animals  the phenotype distribution is a mixture of two distributions. We calculate the QTL transmission probability (p) as the probability of the sire transmitting QTL allele  = p= (= 1 | m)  while the probability of transmitting the other allele  is 1 - p= (= 0 | m)  where mis the \"flanking\" marker genotype information. Probabilities depend on the distance from the putative QTL to the marker(s) calculated via Haldane's mapping function. If the immediate flanking markers are \"informative\" (genotyped as '1' or '2')  they provide all possible information. Wherever a \"semi-informative\" marker ('12') is encountered adjacent to a putative QTL  the minimal set of markers that contains all the information for that QTL comprises the smallest set of contiguous markers flanked by \"informative\" markers. At regular distances (typically 1 cM) along the length of the chromosome  the log-likelihood is constructed assuming a QTL at that position ()   where (·) is the probability density function (PDF) for a normal distribution (assuming that is the appropriate model for the data type). The log-likelihood is maximized using the E-M algorithm[]  which allows standard linear model software to be used  in an iterative manner. This requires computation at each iteration of the posterior probabilities (t) that the sire transmits allele   conditional on its phenotype  At the peak log-likelihood position ( estimated QTL location)  these tvalues can be used to classify backcross animals with high probability of having received the  (or ) allele. Also at the peak  a 1-LOD support interval for estimated QTL position was determined by determining the range of map positions that are within one LOD of the peak. Implementation of the program in R has the advantage that the QTL mapping procedure can be extended within other modelling and graphical capabilities of this package. For normally distributed traits  the linear model function  is used  and this easily allows model extension to include interactions between the QTL and other fixed effects  such as sex-specific QTL effects: most other QTL analysis programs do not allow such extensions. Another advantage of the R system is the relative ease to model traits of different types. This is achieved by changing only a few lines of code  primarily (1) replacing the  call by another function call  and (2) replacing the normal PDF in the tcalculation (dnorm()) by the appropriate PDF (or discrete probability function) for the required distribution. Using QTL-MLE  separate genome scans were conducted for single QTL on the bodyweights at the start and end of the four growth phases. For these traits  the model-based predictions from the piecewise-linear mixed model output were analysed rather than the raw data. The stages analysed were at weeks 2  43  56  83  and 98. Note that week-2 bodyweights were selected in preference to week-0 (start of Phase I) due to the relatively few birth weights available. The model fitted to these values was as follows: where Weight= model-based bodyweight at week  (2  43  56  83  and 98); Sex = 1 if ram/wether; 0 if ewe; QTL = 1 if Awassi allele  ; 0 if Merino allele   (allele type is unobserved); and e = residual random error term. Note that the unobserved QTL term is taken into account using the E-M algorithm of the interval mapping procedure. The interaction term was added to allow for sex-specific QTL effects. Similarly  the average growth rates during each growth phase were analysed as separate traits. Again  model-based growth rates were used  as obtained from the piecewise-linear mixed model  and the model-based bodyweight at the start of each growth phase was used as a covariate. (As in the growth rate QTL model  the week-2 predicted bodyweights were used in preference to week-0 predicted ones). The model fitted for this QTL analysis took the following form: where GR= model-based average growth rate in growth phase  and Weight= model-based bodyweight at start of growth phase . Since data for only wethers were available for the last growth phase (83–98 weeks)  a term for sex was not included in either the week-98 body weight analysis  or the growth rate analysis. An additional series of analyses was performed without inclusion of the initial weight as a covariate. Because of the large number of analyses  we adopted the false discovery rate (FDR) method of Benjamini and Hochberg [] to adjust -values for all traits to control for genome-wise error rates. Results were concluded to be significant when the adjusted -values were less than 0.05. In all of these cases  LOD scores generated by QTL-MLE were larger than 2; QTL are described as suggestive where the -value exceeds chromosome wide  < 0.05 threshold but not the 0.01 threshold. Based on a type I error of 0.01  the design had a power of 0.80 to detect QTL with 0.3 SD effect with 510 animals and an average marker spacing of 20 cM []. For comparative purposes  all traits were analysed using the half-sib applet in QTL Express []. With the exception of the QTL × fixed effect interaction  the same fixed effects as in the MLE analysis were fitted. Chromosome-wide significance thresholds were assessed using permutation tests []  and bootstrap procedures [] were used to obtain confidence intervals  both implemented in QTL Express using 1 000 re-samplings. Methods for mapping a single QTL can be biased by the presence of other QTL [  ]. To address this situation  two-QTL models were also fitted for all traits using QTL Express []. To control for false-positive QTL due to multiple testing  the permutation thresholds obtained in the single-QTL analyses were used to test for the significance of the two-versus one-QTL for a particular trait. Corresponding -values for the two-versus zero-QTL test are included for comparison and additional support  although the same significance thresholds would not be applicable (given it would be a two numerator df test rather than a one df test). From the 200 markers used  194 markers showed significant linkage with at least one other marker at a LOD score of 3 or greater within their assigned linkage group (chromosome). The six markers that did not show significant linkage with other markers on their assigned chromosome were DIK4933 and OARFCB129 on OAR3  TGLA116 on OAR4  MCM185 on OAR7  BM6108 on OAR10 and RM024 on OAR24. All these markers were excluded from the framework map. A further three markers were excluded because their inclusion did not improve the overall LOD score of the framework map  even though they had a LOD of 3 or greater with one other marker within their linkage group. These three markers were KAP8 on OAR1  TGLA67 and OARFCB5 on OAR3. The final map contains 191 markers. For the framework map  both Carthagene and Multipoint produced the same linkage and map order results. The additional file  presents the LOD score differences between the best and second-best map order for each chromosome generated by Carthagene. Except for OAR1  2  10 and 17  all other chromosomes yield a LOD score difference greater than 3.0 between the best and second-best map order. Thus the framework map can be considered fixed for the majority of the chromosomes. A detailed higher resolution order and length can be found in additional file . In our framework map  we have also included four bovine microsatellite markers (DIK4572  DIK4527  DIK4612  and DIK2269) that are presently not included on the Sheep Linkage v4.7 Best Position Map. DIK4572 has been mapped to BTA2 [] and in the present study is placed on OAR2 with a two-point LOD score of 4.8 with its closest marker INRA135. DIK 4527  DIK4612 and DIK2269 all map on BTA20 []  and in the present study are placed on OAR16 with respective two-point LOD scores of 28.2  14.7 and 11.8 with their closest neighbouring markers. These bovine and ovine positions are consistent with the cattle-sheep comparative map as shown on the Sheep Linkage Map web site . Apart from a slight difference in marker position  the marker order of the ReproGen Framework Map is the same as the Sheep Linkage Map Best Position Map v4.7. Sixteen chromosomes had a length at least a 7 cM greater than that in Sheep Linkage Map v 4.7  indicating slightly more recombination in the ReproGen map population. Six chromosomes (OAR4  6  12  13  23  26) showed a similar length (within 3 cM) in both maps. Table  presents the number of observations  the mean and the standard deviation of body weight at each of the measurement weeks. The plot of the weights (Figure ) indicates distinct changes at weeks 43  56  and 86  suggesting growth phases. The fitted piecewise-linear mixed models for individual sheep are shown in Figure . . (A) Raw body weight data; (B) predicted values after piecewise-linear mixed modeling; the three dashed vertical lines separate the four growth phases at 43  56  and 83 weeks. All fixed effect terms in the piecewise-linear mixed model are significant (Table ) indicating different growth profiles for both sexes  and support for the change in growth rate across the four phases. Table  also shows the estimated variance components  with their approximate standard errors. These represent individual animal variation in birth weights  and also in their individual growth rates  across the different phases. Table  presents detailed results of the genome scan for QTL of body weight (BW) at the critical weeks separating the growth phases. Table  shows the corresponding information for growth rate (GR) during each of the four phases  whilst Table  shows the same information for growth rate traits  but after adjustment for body weight at the start of the growth phase. The 1-LOD support intervals generated by QTL-MLE are also reported. Figure  presents a QTL map showing the alignment of the QTL for all body weight traits along the genome  and Figures  and  show similar scans for growth rate QTL  unadjusted and adjusted for initial body weights. The additional file  contains all results using QTL-MLE and QTL Express showing the relative positions of the peaks along the genome for the different traits.   .     .       . With the exception of BW02  QTL for body weight traits have been identified across the sheep genome (OAR1  3  6  11  21  23  24  and 26). Importantly  examination of the 1-LOD support intervals suggests that the same QTL are involved in various body weight traits (OAR3 for BW43  BW56  and BW83  OAR6 for BW43  BW56  and BW83  OAR11 for BW43  BW56  and BW83  OAR21 for BW43  BW56  and BW83 and OAR24 for BW43  and BW83). In addition  the QTL effects for males were almost always greater in absolute value than for females  and for males in particular  the effect of the Awassi allele led to an increase in body weight relative to the Merino allele. Multiple QTL were also detected for the growth rate traits  and in general  these correspond to the QTL identified for the critical body weight traits  in terms of map position and also effect. All the body weight QTL also mapped to growth rate QTL  but in addition a suggestive QTL was found on OAR8 for GR00-43. While the growth rate QTL are in general the same as the body weight QTL  the analysis of growth rate QTL adjusting for the body weight at the start of the growth phase shows quite different results. Note that for the first growth phase  the body weight covariate adjusted for was BW02  since there were relatively few animals with birth weights data. After adjusting for initial body weight  QTL were identified for the first growth phase  GR00-43  corresponding to many of the regions previously identified for body weight and unadjusted growth rate traits  and an additional suggestive QTL was mapped on OAR16. However  no QTL were detected for GR43-56 after adjusting for BW43 (this period corresponding to a period of weight loss). Three QTL (on OAR3  7 and 18) were detected for GR56-83  and only one QTL (on OAR1) for GR83-98. Note that OAR1 is involved in body weight and growth rate QTL on three chromosomal locations  namely 32–68 cM (GR83-98 adj for BW83  positive effect of Awassi allele)  95–154 cM (BW43  GR00-43  both positive effects)  346–380 cM (BW83  GR43-56  GR56-83  GR00-43 adj for BW02  all negative effects). Mapping results obtained by QTL Express were consistent with those obtained by QTL-MLE  particularly for those with greater effects (additional file ). QTL Express also identified additional QTL on OAR6  16 (GR02 in week 2) and OAR3 and 26 (GR4 in week 42) (but as noted earlier  it was not possible to fit sex-specific QTL effects in QTL Express). Significant results for the two-QTL model are presented in Table . Overall  the two-QTL procedure detected far fewer QTL compared with the single-QTL methods  as QTL were detected for only three traits. For adjusted GR56-83  two QTL were detected in coupling phase on OAR3  one at 104 cM and the other at 284 cM  both with effects of ~0.35 SD (Table )  the 3D surface plot of the variance ratio test statistic is shown in the additional file . In the single-QTL analyses  the second peak at 284 is clearly visible on the interval map. For the adjusted GR00-43  two QTL were mapped in very close proximity on OAR4 (108 cM and 112 cM) in repulsion phase. However  given that both these positions are flanked by the same markers (OARCP26 and OARHH35)  and that both QTL have extremely large estimated effects (~ ± 2.8 SD)  it is unlikely that these are real QTL. For adjusted GR83-98  a similar situation occurred on OAR4 (24 cM and 28 cM)  and on OAR22 for the same trait (68 cM: -1.75 SD  and 88 cM: +1.90 SD) with the QTL being mapped to separate marker bracket intervals. This paper reports the construction of a male distance framework map for sheep and its application in the identification of QTL for body weight and growth. There are several advantages in developing a separate framework map. First  it provides an independent verification to the Sheep Linkage Map v4.7  since it originates from a single sheep resource. It would be possible to integrate the data in this map with the data of other Sheep Linkage Maps to create an integrated framework map for sheep. The ReproGen framework map and the Sheep Linkage Map v4.7 agree well  with no changes in marker order. With the exception of OAR4  6  12  13  14  18  23 and 26  the ReproGen map is 11% larger than the male-averaged Sheep Linkage Map v4.7. Perhaps one explanation for this is that the current map was constructed using a single sire family with a large number of progeny  compared with the Sheep Linkage Map v4.7  which is derived from a large number of smaller families. The second advantage in constructing an experiment specific framework map is that the QTL can be unambiguously mapped to a fixed location since the markers are in a fixed order. The use of a framework map not only allows integration of markers in a consensus map  but also alignment of QTL in integrated maps for future meta-analyses such as those undertaken in dairy cattle by Khatkar et al. []. The pattern of growth in this flock is consistent for sheep maintained on semi-improved pasture in a temperate Australian tablelands climate. Such grazing systems are characterized by low pasture availability in the colder winter months  and abundant pasture growth in spring with a residual pasture carry over in summer and autumn. The availability of pasture is reflected in the growth curve over a period of 52 weeks  with a rapid growth following birth in spring till the end of autumn  a period of no growth or decline coinciding with winter  and a subsequent cycle between 52 and 98 weeks. Consistent with findings in previous studies using European sheep  we have identified a number of significant QTL for body weight and growth rates on different chromosomes. In order to minimize the large number of possible QTL detected for single-point estimates of body weight  all data were combined through a growth curve over a period where changes in body weight were similar for all sheep as shown in the stick-point graph (Figure ). The points of change in growth (break points) were identified by single-point body weights  which were used in the QTL analyses as reference body weights. Since growth between each break point was strongly influenced by starting body weights at each time  true growth rate was analysed by adjusting for starting body weights. The final outcome of summarizing all body weights in relatively few growth and body weight indicators was that 17 body weight time points were collapsed to 12 core traits instead of the 49 possible correlated traits. It allows for a greater consistency in QTL reporting for traits related to growth. Despite the economic importance of body weight and growth rates in sheep and the extensive studies reporting genetic variation in this trait [    ]  relatively few QTL studies have been reported to date. In this study  we report 54 QTL involved in body weight and growth rate. The majority of the QTL (49 out of 54) are co-located across nine chromosomal regions  suggesting QTL with a general effect on growth and body weight (OAR1  3  6  11  21  23  24 and 26). Only five QTL (OAR7  8  12  16 and 18) were observed for a single growth trait  and notably four of these were for growth rate adjusted for starting body weight. Our study identified new QTL for body weight/growth (OAR6  7  8  11  12  16  21  24 and 26) since our study covers a full autosomal genome scan as distinct from the previous partial genome scans  to the best of our knowledge. Our study confirmed QTL for growth and body weight previously reported by Walling et al [  ]  and McRae [] and slaughter live weight [] on OAR1  3  and 18. In our study  no QTL for growth was observed on OAR2  and OAR5 where Walling et al []  Karamichou et al [] and Margawati et al [] reported QTL. The effects of the QTL detected in this study are relatively large (in the order of 0.4 to 0.7 phenotypic standard deviations) and originated predominantly from the larger-framed Awassi grandsire  as expected with the favourable allele for growth and body size. In five out of 54 cases  the reverse was observed with the favourable allele originating from the Merino breed  suggesting the presence of cryptic QTL. These estimated QTL effects are consistent with the significant genetic variation in growth that has been observed within this breed (e.g Merino body weight heritabilities are in the range of 0.39–0.76  based on a recent comprehensive study by Huisman et al []. The current study has the power to detect QTL effects of 0.3 SD or larger. However  surprisingly for most traits  significant sex by QTL interactions were observed  with most QTL expressed in males but not females (Tables     ). No immediate or obvious explanation can be given for this  since the ewes and wethers were managed together for most of the period. A notable feature of this study was that the QTL locations have relatively small 1-LOD intervals  most likely due to the relatively large family size. This will facilitate positional candidate gene analyses and make a significant contribution to possible future meta-analyses. Some of the QTL reported in this paper are consistent with possible candidate genes that have been suggested for growth and body weight. The additional file  shows a comparison between the QTL region detected here with linkage and association studies of other groups as well as possible candidate genes possibly included in the regions. The maximum likelihood approaches to QTL detection employed in this analysis were in general robust and their results were in good agreement with those of QTL Express []  which is based on the least-squares methodology. Overall  33 QTL were detected by both methods  with an additional 20 QTL identified by QTL-MLE alone  and another nine detected by QTL Express alone. However of the additional 29 QTL detected by only one of these methods  the majority (15/20 for QTL-MLE and 9/9 for QTL Express) had suggestive significance levels  as indicated by -values for each method. However  it should be pointed out that the QTL-MLE could detect sex-specific QTL  which may have increased the power of the analysis. This is considered a notable advantage of our approach in that QTL × fixed effects can be fitted  which at the time of development was not possible in QTL Express. Obviously  this is a major consideration in our study since most QTL for growth and body weight appear to have differential effects in both sexes. An additional benefit of QTL-MLE is the flexibility of analysis offered  due to working in the R environment  with the ready potential for further enhancements in the future. However  QTL Express has the benefit of being able to fit two-QTL models. While three chromosomes containing two QTL were identified  two were unlikely given the size of the effect estimates  but strong support is indicated for two QTL for growth rate between weeks 56 and 83  adjusted for week-56 body weight on OAR3. In conclusion  we present significant evidence for an independent framework map  which is in very good agreement with the previously published Sheep Linkage Map v4.7 framework map for sheep. We also present evidence for a significant number of new QTL for body weight and growth rate in sheep  and confirm and support the presence of previously published QTL in breeds other than those studied here. As indicated earlier  a large range of traits have been recorded from this sheep mapping study. Subsequent papers will describe QTL for these traits  using the current paper as a foundation to describe the overall approach. As SNP chips become more widely available for research in sheep genetics  this series of papers should provide a reference point to QTL studies in sheep using microsatellite markers.

For these data  the variance model involves the direct product of a large numerator relationship matrix   and a complex structure for the genotype by environment interaction effects  generally of a factor analytic (FA) form. With MET data  we expect a high correlation in genotype rankings between environments  leading to non-positive definite covariance matrices. Estimation methods for reduced rank models have been derived for the FA formulation with independent genotypes  and we employ these estimation methods for the more complex case involving the numerator relationship matrix. We examine the performance of differing genetic models for MET data with an embedded pedigree structure  and consider the magnitude of the non-additive variance. The capacity of existing software packages to fit these complex models is largely due to the use of the sparse matrix methodology and the average information algorithm. Here  we present an extension to the standard formulation necessary for estimation with a factor analytic structure across multiple environments. Selection of plants and animals in a breeding program deals with experimental data for which the underlying genetic model is best formulated as a mixed linear model. The genetic model is improved by including pedigree information through an additive relationship matrix  . This matrix can be quite large and complex for large populations involving many generations  and its inverse is required when solving the mixed model equations. Efficient methods have been developed to permit routine application of this methodology. However  its application to multiple traits or environments in crop populations  where both additive and non-additive genetic variation can be measured  raises some issues to be resolved. While pedigree information has been used extensively in animal breeding  adoption on a routine basis in the plant breeding sphere has been much slower. In cereal breeding programs  genotype performance is typically measured in a series of replicated field trials grown across multiple locations and years  and is collectively referred to as a multi-environment trial (MET)  where current MET analyses assume independence between genotypes []. Benefits from the use of pedigree information can be two-fold. Firstly  the estimates of individual genotype performance are more accurate through the use of correlated information from relatives. In addition  breeding values can be estimated for each genotype  quantifying the potential of the individual as a parent in the breeding program. One important aspect in the use of pedigree information in plant populations is the underlying genetic model  as additive and non-additive effects can be estimated separately []. This partitioning is possible since field crop data are generally from plots of genetically identical material  replicated both within and across environments. The additive component provides a simple covariance structure between related lines and the non-additive component is the lack of fit to the additive one. Crossa et al. [] have fitted a genetic model including only an additive component  ignoring the non-additive variation. In our work  we investigate the performance of these different models and comment on the magnitude of the non-additive variation. The lack of fit can also be attributed to various forms of non-additivity including dominance [] and additive by additive interaction [] but we have not considered these more complex models. The most general form for the genetic variance matrix from MET data is a fully unstructured matrix with  ( + 1)/2 parameters where  is the number of environments  and this matrix is  by definition  nonnegative definite. For particular data  genotype effects are often highly correlated across some environments  leading to an estimated genetic covariance matrix that violates this condition; imposing constraints to force nonnegative definiteness leads to singular matrices  but standard REML methods require non-singular variance matrices. The magnitude of the estimation problem increases with the number of environments included  and the usual response is to replace the fully unstructured matrix with a more parsimonious approximation  the simplest of which has a common correlation across all environments. The factor analytic (FA) form introduced by Smith et al. [] is intermediate in parsimony and is widely used in the analysis of MET data from most Australian plant breeding programs. Kelly et al. [] have shown through simulation that this FA model is a robust model with high predictive accuracy. This model can accommodate increased correlation structure through incorporation of more factors  and can accommodate the singularity issue in the sparse matrix formulation presented by Thompson et al. []. When fitting a pedigree model across multiple environments  both Crossa et al. [] and Oakey et al. [] have adopted an FA model for the genotype by environment effects. Applications of the FA methodology have also recently arisen in the animal breeding literature  for example Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] have fitted a constrained form of the factor model to animal pedigree data across multiple traits. However  problems arise in estimation methods for pedigree models combined with a complex variance structure across multiple environments or traits. Henderson [] has presented a simple recursive method for computing the inverse of a relationship matrix    without the need to form the relationship matrix  itself. More recent improvements to the methodology have come from the work of Quaas [] and Meuwissen and Luo []  and this efficient algorithm is currently implemented in the software package ASReml []. For more complex variance models involving both the factor analytic and pedigree structure  the average information (AI) residual maximum likelihood (REML) methodology requires the formation of both elements of  and for the score equations and working variables. In this paper  we present the estimation approach used in ASReml for these more complex models and show how computational efficiency is maintained by only forming some elements of  In summary  this paper adopts the genetic model of Oakey et al. [] with an extension to multi-environment trial data as the prototype []. We have investigated efficient model formulation and REML estimation of variance parameters for multiple environment/trait data using the standard approach in ASReml  with an extension for the factor analytic structure. An example of a multi-environment trial with pedigree structure is presented  and the goodness of fit of differing genetic models is considered. Consider a series of  trials in which a total of  genotypes has been grown. Although  genotypes need not be tested in each trial  it is necessary to have adequate linkage between trials to estimate covariances. It is assumed that the trial comprises field plots and we let  be the total number of plots. A general mixed model for the  × 1 vector  of individual plot yields combined across trials can be written as where  is the  × 1 vector of fixed effects (typically environment means)   is an  × 1 vector of (random) genotype by environment effects  with associated design matrix     is a  × 1 vector of random effects (modelling design effects in the experiment)  with corresponding design matrix    and  is the  × 1 vector of plot error effects combined across trials. The random effects for genotypes can be partitioned according to the genetic model of Oakey et al. []. Additive effects can be estimated if pedigree information is available for the genotypes  and  if genotypes are replicated as they commonly are in METs  non-additive effects can also be estimated. The vector of genotype effects can be written as where  is the  × 1 vector of (random) additive genotype effects and  is the  × 1 vector of (random) non-additive genotype effects  both ordered as genotypes within trials. The random effects from equations () and () are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance matrix and The variance matrix for the plot error effects is assumed to be block diagonal with  = diag ()  where  is the error variance matrix for the  trial. The variance matrix for extraneous random effects    is usually a diagonal matrix of scaled identity matrices. The partitioned genetic effects may each be represented as a two-way table of genotype by environment effects  and we assume that the variance matrix for the additive genotype effects has the separable form where  and  are  ×  and  ×  symmetric positive definite matrices  respectively.  is the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances between environments  and  is the variance/covariance matrix between genotypes. Following the approach of Oakey et al.[]  we set  =   where  is a known numerator relationship matrix formed from pedigree information. In a similar way  the non-additive effects may be represented as a two-way structure of genotype by environment effects  with an associated variance of where  and  are also  ×  and  ×  symmetric positive definite matrices  respectively. We assume independence between the non-additive genotype components and hence set  = . The inclusion of this non-additive effect follows the model of Oakey . [] and contrasts with the approach adopted by Crossa . [] and Burgueno . []  who choose to either omit the non-additive term  or model it as the interaction of additive effects   =  #   where # is the element-wise multiplication operator []. There are numerous possible choices for the form of  and . The form of the variance matrix adopted here is an FA model based on  factors  denoted FA  and is given by where  is a  ×  matrix of environment loadings and is a  ×  diagonal matrix with elements commonly referred to as specific variances. In our model with partitioned genetic effects we will also be estimating parameters for the non-additive components  and . The particular form of the variance model for genetic effects to be estimated is  and the plot variance from (4) and (5) is Reduced rank models are a special case of the FA model in which more than  of the specific variances are zero. The extreme of the reduced rank case is when all specific variances are constrained to be zero  as fitted in the fully reduced rank models proposed by Meyer and Kirkpatrick []. These models are denoted as FARR models  for a -dimensional FA model with all specific variances constrained to be zero. Estimation of parameters in model (1) is achieved using two linked processes. Firstly  the variance parameters are estimated using REML []. This involves an iterative process  and in this paper the AI algorithm is used []. The second process involves estimation of Best Linear Unbiassed Predictors (BLUPs) of the random effects  and Best Linear Unbiassed Estimators (BLUEs) of the fixed effects in the model. As these effects are formed with estimated  rather than known  variance parameters they are referred to as empirical BLUEs and empirical BLUPs. Thompson . [] have described a method for estimation in reduced rank models with uncorrelated genotypes and we adapt this method for a relationship matrix  replacing  with  and  as appropriate. A key issue for estimation with the more complex factor analytic models is that working variates require formation of   in addition to as  This requirement potentially reduces the efficiency of the methodology over simple pedigree models  which only require formation of . To simplify the working variates  the standard approach in ASReml operates on the vector   obtained by directly solving the system of equations   using absorption and back substitution. This approach estimates only those elements of  that are required  and avoids having to completely form  as such  so that we can then substitute for   and proceed with routine application of the AI algorithm. We have considered an alternative formulation based on a Cholesky decomposition of   but this introduced more dense matrices into the score and working variables. As such the formulation used in ASReml was the most efficient approach due to the sparsity of the  matrix  and the numerical methods used which capitalise on this property. The example data is a combined set of Stage 2 trials taken from the Queensland barley breeding program  grown in 2003 and 2004. Trial locations and dimensions together with mean yields for each trial are summarised in Table . The series follows two years of trials in the breeding program  where genotypes progress through stages of selection. A total of 1255 unique genotypes were tested in this series of trials  with 698 and 720 genotypes tested in 2003 and 2004  respectively. A common set of 163 genotypes was tested in both years  and the level of concurrence between all trials is shown in Table . The pedigrees of these genotypes were traced back four generations  in order to calculate elements of the numerator relationship matrix  . Partially replicated designs []  were used for all 14 trials in this series. Each dataset was analysed using the methods described in Section 2. A simple diagonal model for  and  failed to detect the presence of non-additive genetic variance at five of the 14 sites  so these were fixed to zero. In addition  four of the specific variances in the FA model for the nine sites were constrained to be zero  implying that the single latent factor explains all of the non-additive variance for these sites. Four general classes of genetic model are examined. The first involves fitting the genotype effects as independent  fitting  but not  as a standard FA model []. The second class of model fits   but not   following the approach of Crossa . []  who chose to omit non-additive genetic effects. The third class of model fits both components []  in a model akin to Equation (). Finally  fully reduced rank factor analytic models are considered  where the particular form of the variance structure for additive effects is constrained to follow the model of Meyer and Kirkpatrick []. The common element in all models for genetic variance is an FA structure for the genetic variance matrix. Each model begins with an FA structure of order 1  and progresses through higher dimensions as dictated by REML ratio tests (REMLRT). In the standard FA model  specific variances are constrained to be zero when they tend to estimates on the boundary of parameter space. In the fully reduced rank (FARR) model all specific variances are constrained to be zero  as this FARR structure deals solely with the factor component of the model. To account for model parsimony  an Akaike Information criteria (AIC) is calculated for each model  and models are compared by forming the difference in AIC between each model and the best model. The model with maximum REML log-likelihood and significant improvement in REMLRT over subsequent nested models is Model 8 in Table   which includes an FA structure of order 3 for additive effects  and an FA structure or order 1 for non-additive effects. It comes from a class of models proposed by Oakey . []  in which Models 6 and 7 are lower order FA models  and involves fitting 71 genetic variance parameters through two FA structures. Model 8 is considered the best model based on the criterion of minimum AIC. The performance of other models is now considered in greater detail. The simplest models for genetic variance  and those currently used in plant breeding programs in Australia  are Models 1–3  assuming independence between genotypes  (Table ). Of these three models  the model of best fit is Model 3 with an FA structure of three dimensions. However it is inferior to all models incorporating pedigree information (Models 4–14). The second class of model fitted  Models 4 and 5  involves only additive genetic variance  and does not capitalise on replication of genotypes and partitioning of non-additive effects. While these models are superior to those assuming independent genotypes  they are still inferior to the genetic model that partitions additive and non-additive effects  (Models 6–8). The remaining models (Models 6–14) differ purely in the model for additive effects. The first subset (Models 6–8) involves an FA structure for  of increasing dimension  and the model with maximum likelihood is taken from this subset. The reduced rank (FARR) models impose a constraint on the more general FA model  and it can be noted that this constraint results in models of poorer fit for the same number of FA dimensions. In fact  six dimensions must be fitted in the reduced rank form (FARR6) to produce equivalent likelihoods to the best FA model with three dimensions. The AIC comparison also indicates that the general FA model produces a more parsimonious form than the FARR models. In terms of the actual estimated parameters  we observed heterogeneity of both additive and non-additive genetic variance and heterogeneity of error variances across environments. Summaries of estimates of these variance parameters from the best model for  and  are given in Table . Genetic covariance in this data set was also heterogeneous and in our experience this is also typical of most multi-environment trial data. Genetic correlations were predominantly positive but there were instances where some pairs of trials had low/zero genetic correlation. Of greatest importance to a breeding program is the impact of new analysis models on selection decisions. By examining changes in the empirical BLUPs between competing models  we can assess any changes in the ranking of the genotypes and subsequent changes in the selected subset of genotypes. Figure  displays the empirical BLUPs from the 'best' pedigree model  consisting of an FA3 model for additive effects combined with an FA1 model for non-additive effects  against the empirical BLUPs from the standard FA3 model assuming independence between genotypes. These plots are demonstrated using a subset of four sites. There is close agreement in rankings of empirical BLUPs for sites (c) and (d)  where only six and two different genotypes are included in the top 46 genotypes (which forms the top 10%)  respectively. These sites represent those with moderate and low levels of error variance  relative to additive genetic variance  (see Table ). For sites (a) and (b) the empirical BLUPs deviate more from the one-to-one relationship  with 17 genotypes differing in the ranks of the top 46 genotypes. . (a) 2003 Biloela  (b) 2003 Clifton  (c) 2003 Tamworth  (d) 2004 Gilgandra. The four sites in Figure  were chosen to demonstrate the different types of patterns evident in genotype predictions between the competing models. The relativity of additive genetic variance to error variance varies markedly between all sites  and while there is some consistency in genotype prediction for the sites with low error variance  there are many and varied patterns for sites with low to moderate levels of additive variance relative to error. Also  no consistent pattern in genotype predictions based on the relative magnitude of additive and non-additive variance is observed. For example  the site in Figure  has a very low proportion of non-additive variance estimated in the model  while plots (b) and (c) have the same proportion of non-additive variance (relative to total variance)  with vastly different patterns between predictions. It is also obvious from the banding patterns in Figure  and  that genotypes are regressing to a different underlying response in the pedigree model. The additive component provides a simple covariance structure between related lines and the non-additive component is the lack of fit to the additive one. Incorporation of the additive covariance in the model means each line is regressed toward the level predicted by its relatives  rather than to a common level for all genotypes  and reflects the theory of breeding by selection of parents for the next generation. The banding patterns in plots (a) and (b) result from the same cross  where the performance of individuals within this cross is elevated in plot (a) and depressed in plot (b). These differential predictions demonstrate the interaction between additive genetic variance and environment. The inclusion of pedigree information in the analysis of MET data adds to the complexity of the mixed model and associated variance structure. Most plant breeding trials consist of replicated plot data across multiple environments  with an underlying variance structure for spatial effects and heterogeneity of variance at the residual level. Current analysis methods for MET data adopt a factor analytic variance structure for genetic correlation between environments. When the pedigree structure is added to model the relationship between genotypes  the resulting mixed model is quite complex  requiring the estimation of numerous variance parameters  and subsequent prediction of random genotype effects. The capacity of existing software to fit these complex models to 'real' data sets  (see ASReml) is largely due to the use of sparse matrix methodology and the AI algorithm []. In the analysis of the example data set  we investigate different genetic models for multi-environment data with a factor analytic variance structure. The genetic model of Oakey . []  with an extension for MET data []  adequately captures both the additive and non-additive genetic variation across environments  and is the model of best fit to the example data used in this study. Although only a small proportion of the total variation in the example data set is due to non-additive effects  a low order factor analytic model assuming independent genotypes still improved the goodness of fit. The genetic model with only additive effects []  may be adequate when the level of non-additive genetic variance is low. Reduced rank models were less parsimonious than those with a standard FA form  requiring estimation of many more parameters from a greater number of dimensions to achieve an equivalent goodness of fit. In theory  non-additive effects are comprised of the higher order interaction terms between additive and dominance effects []. In practice  the partitioning of the interaction variance is seldom more than trivial when compared with the errors of estimation []. While it is shown to be potentially beneficial to fit a simple model for non-additive variance  we surmise that partitioning into a complex model for non-additive effects [] is unnecessary  as these often represent a relatively small proportion of the total genetic variance. The improvement in model fit over the current model for MET data [] is achieved through the inclusion of the numerator relationship matrix  . In this paper  the relationship matrix is derived from pedigree information in the breeding program  but with the proliferation of molecular marker and quantitative trait loci data  elements of the genetic relationship matrix may now be derived in different ways []. For differing applications  the inter-individual relationships may be estimated  rather than assumed to be known  and methodology is available for estimating the elements of this correlation matrix  . In these instances  it will not have the properties that allow to be an easily formed sparse matrix and this will limit the population size to which this empirical  matrix can be applied. Of greatest importance to genetic gain in a breeding program is the impact of new analysis models on selection decisions. In this paper  we consider goodness of fit of each genetic model  and the impact of changes in rankings of empirical BLUPs of genotype effects between the pedigree and standard models. A large proportion of changes occur in the rankings of the genotypes at some environments  and we assume that the pedigree model would be predicting the most accurate effects. An additional benefit to selection of individuals and parents in the program is that the pedigree model estimates and adjusts for the interaction between additive genetic effects and environment. An alternative way of assessing the impact on selection is through an improvement in prediction error variance (pev) of the empirical BLUPs from competing models. While for the pedigree model in our study the pev was reduced on average  we commonly overlook the fact that in this type of experiments  known biases are present in the pev and the empirical BLUPs themselves. The assumption of known  is violated as variance parameters must be estimated  and resulting empirical BLUPs and pev's are formed from   not . Studies have shown that  while the properties of BLUPs do not hold under estimation of   the factor analytic models still perform well for empirical BLUPs []. A simulation study is required to examine the performance of empirical BLUPs for these more complex genetic models.

It was concluded that selection for the number of fertile eggs after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen could effectively increase the duration of the fertile period in ducks and that research should now be focused on ways to improve the viability of the hybrid mule duck embryo. The mule duck is the major commercial source of duck meat (soup or roasted) and is produced by crossing Tsaiya  Pekin or Kaiya (crossbred Pekin × White Tsaiya) ducks with Muscovy drakes. The reproductive efficiency of ducks has been successfully improved over the last twenty years in Taiwan by using artificial insemination (AI) []. This is also a popular method in France where male mule ducks are force-fed to produce fatty liver and the females are used for meat production []  and in Europe  Vietnam and southeast China for meat production [–]. Thus in the last few decades  it has become common practice in many countries worldwide  to use AI as a reproduction technique for mule duck production. Unfortunately  owing to the short duration of fertility in such intergeneric crossbreeding  the ducks have to be inseminated twice a week in order to maintain the fertility rate [–]. It would be economically beneficial if the female could be inseminated once instead of twice a week and if the fertility rate could be increased. The aim of the selection experiment was therefore to increase the duration of fertility in order to reduce the frequency of AI required. Previous results in domestic fowl had demonstrated the feasibility of selecting for a longer fertile period [  ]. Thereafter  Tai . [] found that the best selection criterion for duration of fertility in the Brown Tsaiya female duck seemed to be the number of fertile eggs laid between the 2 and 15 day after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen. Therefore  in 1992  the Livestock Research Institute (LRI)  Hsinhua  Tainan  Taiwan began a selection experiment to increase the number of fertile eggs (F) in the Brown Tsaiya female duck after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen in one selected and one control (unselected) line []. Fertility was measured by candling the eggs on the 7 day of incubation. The genetic parameters for the duration of fertility in Brown Tsaiya duck were estimated from the data obtained from the selected and control lines up to the 5 generation of selection []. The selection responses for number of fertile eggs up to the 7 generation of selection were analyzed []. The effects of selection on duration of fertility and its consequences on hatchability over 10 generations of selection were characterized using logistic curves to adjust fertility and hatchability rates as a function of number of days after AI []. Reports were published throughout the selection experiment [    ]. It is the usual practice to inseminate with pooled semen for producing mule ducklings. However in generation 12 the objective for an experiment was to evaluate fertility of Muscovy drakes after single AI with individual semen. As far as we know no full analyses of the direct and correlated effects of long-term selection experiments in ducks have been published. This study analyses the direct response to the selection on number of fertile eggs after a single AI of Brown Tsaiya duck with pooled Muscovy semen and correlated responses on the maximum duration of fertility  number of hatched mule ducklings  duration of fertility and hatchability for eleven generations of selection. One hundred and six Brown Tsaiya LRI no. 2 female ducks and 28 Brown Tsaiya LRI no. 2 drakes  originating from a Brown Tsaiya Line 105 studied for laying traits and developed at the Ilan branch of the Livestock Research Institute (LRI)  were used as foundation stock (G0) [  ]. Foundation birds were assumed to be unrelated and not inbred. In the first generation (G1)  165 ducks and 117 drakes were divided into two groups. The selected line (S) consisted of 48 ducks and 23 drakes bred from different parents  and with the highest predicted breeding values according to the BLUP animal model  for the number of fertile eggs at candling (F). The control line (C) consisted of 46 ducks and 20 drakes selected with near average predicted breeding values in each family. These two groups were used to produce the subsequent generation (G2). The first hatch in G1 was on February 16  1992 and the last one in G12 was on January 4  2005. Both lines were maintained simultaneously under standardized conditions at the LRI experimental farm in Hsinhua  Tainan. In total  1438 males and 2602 females in the S line  1097 males and 2105 females in the C line were measured and recorded respectively. Generations were kept separate and the generation interval was one year. In the S line  the percentage selected was between 40% and 20.2% in females and between 10.9% and 20.8% in males. In the S line  male and female ducks in each generation were selected by applying the BLUP animal model and operating a truncation selection on the highest values for number of fertile eggs from the 2 to 15 day after AI (3 times). The following model was used to determine the breeding values of the selected trait  as described in Cheng []:  =  +  +  +  where  = vector of observations;  = vector of fixed effects of hatching date;  = vector of random genetic effect with E() = 0  Var() =    where  is the additive genetic relationship matrix of the animals   = the additive genetic variance;  = vector of random permanent environmental effect (3 times AI at 26  29 and 32 weeks of age) with E() = 0  Var() =    where  is the identity matrix   = the variance of permanent environmental effects;  = vector of random residual effects with E() = 0  Var() =    where  = the variance of random residual effects;    and  = design matrices relating the elements    and  to the observations. For each generation  an additive genetic relationship matrix was established by taking into account all the ancestors of the selection candidates back to the foundation stock. Duck performance in all generations (from G1) was also taken into account. The genetic parameter estimates used for G1 to G3 were h = 0.34 [] and repeatability r = 0.47 (estimated from G1 data). These values were h = 0.29 and r = 0.40 [] for G4 to G6  and h = 0.26 and r = 0.36 [] from G7 to G12. The breeding values of the candidates to be selected were computed  using a software written by Poivey [] for G1 to G3  and with the PEST program [] thereafter. The schedule was to select 20 males for G1 to G8  12 males from G9 to G12 and 60 females in each generation so that one male could be mated with 3 or 5 females to produce the offspring to be measured in the following generation. From G2 to G12  it was scheduled to have 4 full-sister daughters of each selected dam. The number of full-brother sons of each selected dam was about 2 on average. The plan was to maintain the control line by selecting 20 sires and 60 dams (3 dams per sire). One son of each sire was randomly chosen to replace his father and one daughter of each dam was randomly chosen to replace her mother  for mating according to the rotational scheme shown in Figure []. In the mating plan  constitutive groups of breeders in the control line for the generation G were divided into 20 groups. The three females in the group  were from three different sire groups (m = 1 to 20). The 20 males stayed in their groups. One sire gave one male and one dam gave one female  the sire of group  was the son of group   his mother was one of three dams in group . The three dams in group  gave three females  the first went to the group   the second to the group  and the third to the group . . The ducklings were raised in floor pens and fed a diet containing 19% CP and 2925 Kcal ME kg from 0 to 4 wk followed by a diet containing 13% CP and 2830 Kcal ME kg  from 5 to 15 wk. They were transferred to individual cages when they had laid their first egg. During the laying period  the ducks were fed a diet containing 20% CP and 2810 Kcal ME kg. Drinking water and feed were provided  throughout the experimental period. At 26  29  and 32 weeks of age  the ducks were artificially inseminated with 0.05 mL of pooled semen from 10 to 15 Muscovy drakes of line 302 from LRI  Ilan Station [  ]. In addition  at G12  ducks were artificially inseminated at 36  39 and 42 weeks of age with individual semen from 23 Muscovy drakes  adopting the ratio of one male for six females. Purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the genetic effects of Muscovy drakes on duration of fertility (unpublished results). So in G12  individual and pooled semen were used on the same ducks at different ages. After a single AI  eggs were collected from day 2 to 15 for G1 to G6  and from day 2 to 18 for G7 to G12. They were stored for 7 days and 9 days respectively in the incubator to ensure egg set. Fertility was measured by candling the eggs after 7 days of incubation  and the number of live-hatched ducklings was recorded. Data regarding the number of eggs set (Ie)  the number of fertile eggs at candling (F)  the total number of dead embryos (M)  the maximum duration of fertility from the 2 day after AI up to the day of the last fertile egg (Dm  in number of days)  and the number of hatched mule ducklings (H) were collected. A new generation of ducks was produced by pedigree mating  and pedigree hatching was carried out in each generation thereafter. The elementary statistical parameters (means and variances) of the phenotypic values were obtained using the SAS procedure []. Any unintentional selection was detected by calculating the selection differentials on the breeding values of F in the C line in each generation  from the differences between the averages of birds randomly chosen as parents and from all birds measured in that generation. The inbreeding coefficients were calculated in each generation for the females and males of each line  by using a SAS procedure []. The direct cumulated selection responses and correlated selection responses were measured as the differences between the phenotypic performance averages of the ducks in the S and C lines. Their variances were calculated by taking into account the variances of the error measurements and of the genetic drift [–]. The predicted genetic responses to selection on F were estimated from the within generation line difference (S-C) for the average predicted breeding values for each of the five traits in female ducks. These breeding values were calculated in a 5-trait analysis using the BLUP methodology applied to an individual animal model and previously described for a single trait. These multiple-trait BLUP animal model values were calculated by grouping the records of all five traits together for the selected and control lines from G1 to G12  using the PEST 3.1 package [  ]  with a performance file containing 11721 records and a pedigree file of 7096 ducks. The genetic and phenotypic parameters for the five traits used to estimate these breeding values  were taken from Poivey . []. For simplification  the estimated parameters were used to calculate the approximate standard errors for the generation S-C differences for each trait  given that the breeding values were computed in univariate analyses []. When the fertility or hatchability rates per egg set of the S and C lines in the same generation were plotted as a function of the number of days after AI  the resulting curves were adjusted to logistic functions  in which parameter t was the time in days of half maximal fertility or hatchability [  ]. Over the 11 generations of selection  the average percentage of selected females was 28.9% and of selected males was 17.05%. The unintentional selection differential  which occurred over the 11 generations of selection in the C line was small (-1.09 fertile eggs). It should be noted that the ducks of the S and C lines came from the same hatches in all generations  except G2. In G1 some parents were used to constitute both the S and C lines. In G2  the S line birds were born on 10/02/1993 and 09/03/1993  whereas the C line birds were born on 07/04/1993. Although some AI were performed during the same period in both groups  others were not and this could have led to some inaccuracy in the measurement of selection response in G2. Table  shows the mean inbreeding coefficients for males and females of the S and C lines  for each generation. Individuals of the foundation stock were assumed to be unrelated and not inbred. Therefore  the average inbreeding coefficient in G1 was 0. This was also the case in G2  due to the rotational nature of the mating plan in the C line. In contrast  full-sib and half-sib matings were avoided in the S line. More than one male from a given family with the highest predicted breeding values according to the BLUP animal model for the number of fertile eggs at candling (F) could be used to produce the subsequent generation as selected line. Thereafter  the inbreeding coefficient increased more quickly in the S line than in the C line  as could be expected  but remained moderate: the means in G12 were 0.154 and 0.068 for the males and 0.156 and 0.074 for the females in the S and C line respectively. The genetic parameters (heritabilities and genetic correlations) of the five traits Ie  F  M  Dm  and H were used to calculate the multiple-trait BLUP animal model values for each trait for all measured females from generations G1 to G12. These genetic parameters had been estimated in the conceptual base population []. Table  shows the mean selection responses (with standard errors) and predicted genetic responses (with standard errors) for the F  Ie  M  Dm  and H traits across the 11 generations of selection. Figures        and  show the trends in the selection responses and predicted genetic responses of F  M  Dm  H and Ie. The two responses were similar  except that the former showed greater fluctuation between generations. The selection responses were highly significant for the selected trait and for the correlated traits Dm and H at G4. The correlated selection response for M and Ie became significant at G5 and G11 respectively. At G11  the mean selection response and the mean predicted genetic response were very close  being 4.36 and 4.00 respectively for F  1.57 and 1.08 for M  4.45 and 4.53 for Dm  2.79 and 2.60 for H. These genetic increases at G11 were represented as a percentage of the average traits in G1: 103% for F  85% for M  79% for Dm  and 116% for H. Table  shows the mean (and standard deviation) of the phenotypic values and selection response S-C (P) of Brown Tsaiya females for the F  Ie  M  Dm  and H traits after artificial insemination with individual semen from the 23 Muscovy drakes for G12 in the selected line (S) and control line (C) at 36–42 weeks of age. The mean selection response S-C (P) was 3.46 for F  0.85 for M  3.68 for Dm and 2.59 for H. . . . . . Table  shows the mean (and standard deviation) of fertility and hatchability rates for days 2–15 or days 2–8 after a single AI for the S and C lines in G12 at 26–32 weeks of age (pooled semen) and 36–42 weeks of age (individual semen). The F/Ie  H/Ie percentages in the S and C lines were significantly different for days 2–15 and 2–8 after AI. The hatchability rate calculated as the ratio H/F was slightly higher in the C line than in the S line but this difference was not statistically significant. Due to the effect of an abnormal operation of the incubator  a significant age effect on H/F % was apparent in the S line  especially at G12 . it was larger at 36–42 weeks of age than at 26–32 weeks of age (73.0% versus 60.62%). A larger H/F % value at 36–42 weeks of age than at 26–32 weeks of age was also apparent in the C line (73.06% versus 69.26%)  but the difference was not significant. Figure  shows the evolution of t  time in days of half maximal fertility  of selected (S) and control (C) Brown Tsaiya duck lines across the generations of selection  and the S-C differences. The S-C differences were significant from G3 onwards. They were as high as 4.26 days in G12 (10.75 d. and 6.49 d. for the S and C lines  respectively) showing that the selection response was positive. Figure  shows the evolution of t  the time of half maximal hatchability. The S-C differences were also significant from G3 onwards. They increased up to 3.86 days (10.47 d. and 6.61 d. for the S and C lines  respectively) showing that the correlated selection response was also positive. Figure  shows the adjusted logistic curves and the durations of fertility according to the egg set rates in 1997 (G6)  2001 (G9) and 2005 (G12) for the S line and in 2005 for the C line. The R were >0.99 indicating the goodness of fit. In the S line (in G12) the fertility rates were 91% at d2  above 90% up to d5 and higher than 80% from d6 to d8. From d9 onwards they began to decrease (75%)  to (58%) on d10 and 3% on d15 (Table ). In contrast  the fertility rates in the C line  which were 85% at d2  showed an abrupt decrease from d4 (74%) onwards: . d5 (69%)  d6 (52%)  d7 (36%)  d8 (26%)  d10 (8%) and 0.5% at d15. A similar pattern was observed for hatchability rates (Table ). Consequently  the logistic curve still had the same form but was moved to the right by selection. . . . Solid lines for 2005 represent the functions of logistic curves. y(x) = 91.90 (1+e) for the selected line(S2005) and y(x) = 91.25 (1+e) for the control line(C2005). In avian species the fertile period has been defined as the interval after sperm deposition during which a female can lay fertile eggs. The length of the fertile period is dependent on sperm storage in the tubules at the utero-vaginal junction where the spermatozoa are released for upward transport towards the infundibulum for ova fertilization []. The purpose of this selection experiment was to investigate what genetic progress could be made to extend the duration of fertility in the Brown Tsaiya duck. The selection was carried out using an animal model and the BLUP of breeding values. The selection experiment was continued up to 12 generations using the same methodology of selection already discussed in Cheng . []. In addition the durations of fertility and hatchability were determined and their correlated responses to selection on F were analyzed. The selection responses were calculated  using the common method of calculating selection responses by taking the differences between the average phenotypic values for the S and C lines across the generations of selection [  ]. Sorensen and Kennedy [] described an alternative way of estimating response to selection based on the mixed model approach  as the phenotypic trend can be further divided into genetic and environmental trends. We therefore estimated the genetic trends by averaging the multiple-trait BLUP animal model values for each trait in each generation and determined the differences between the S and C lines. The measured selection responses and the calculated predicted genetic responses were found to be similar. This indicated the adequacy of the data representation model with no confounding with environmental trends and the accuracy of the genetic parameter estimates in the base population. Given the large variability in selection response  especially of H  we have chosen to discuss the predicted genetic response. The genetic progress in F measured by the predicted genetic response was significant . 4.40 genetic standard deviations in total or 40% of the genetic standard deviation per generation. The correlated genetic progress in Dm and H was also significant  . 4.89 and 3.56 genetic standard deviations in total  or 45% and 32% of the average genetic standard deviation per generation  respectively. The frequency of embryo mortality was not increased by selection. These results are consistent with the estimated genetic parameters  thereby showing a high genetic correlation between F and Dm (0.92)  H (0.91) and between Dm and H (0.82). In contrast to results obtained in the chicken hen [  ] and according to the genetic parameter estimates  our results showed that selection on F seemed to be more effective in increasing H than direct selection of that trait. Brun . [] reported heritabilities of 0.25 and 0.23 for F  0.17 and 0.13 for H  and 0.27 and 0.16 for Dm in pure breeding INRA44 duck line and intergeneric crossbreeding  respectively. Our result can be explained by the fact that the heritability of F is greater than that of H (0.26 versus 0.19) and the genetic correlation between F and H is 0.91. This study showed that the selection of F through 11 generations had major correlative effects on parameter t of the logistic curves  which fitted the daily variations (d2-d15) in fertility rates (F/Ie) and hatchability rates (H/Ie). The S-C differences represented selection responses to the duration of fertility and hatchability which were correlated with the selection response of F. Selection for F modified the evolution of the fertility and hatchability rates  as a function of time after a single AI of the Tsaiya duck with pooled Muscovy semen mainly by increasing the time of half maximal fertility and hatchability rates. The largest increases in the fertility rates per day after single AI were between d5 and d11. Selection for F also had correlated effects on the maximum fertility rates  but these were smaller than the effect on fertility duration. Moreover  the fertility rate in the selected line was over 90% from d2 to d5 and above 80% until d8. The same tendencies were observed for changes in the evolution of hatchability rates  showing that embryo viability was not impaired. Consequently  in accordance with Brillard . [] it is suggested that selection on F acted by increasing the storage capacity of spermatozoa  which remained able to fertilize the ova for longer. In addition  the increased duration of fertility when selecting on F was not deleterious to embryo viability. The overall fertility (F/Ie) and hatchability (H/Ie) rates at days 2–8 after AI were higher in the S line than in the C line. The embryonic viability rates in the C line (73.1%) and S line (73.0%)  measured from the hatchability of fertile eggs (H/F)  were not statistically different for G12 (36–42 weeks of age)  confirming the results for G8 and G11 [    ]. The differences in hatchability of fertile eggs (H/F) between the S and C lines over the 11 generations of selection were not statistically different either. On the basis of the results of Tai . []  a long-term selection experiment on F  with a selected and a control line  was begun in 1992. Analysis of this experiment after 11 generations of selection revealed a selection response for F (3.83 eggs)  with correlated selection responses for increasing H (1.91 ducklings) and maximum duration of the fertile period (4 days)  with no increase in embryo mortality rate. The genetic progress in F measured by the selection response was 2.77 genetic standard deviations or 39.6% of the genetic standard deviation per generation in G8 and 4.07 genetic standard deviations or 37% of the genetic standard deviation per generation in G12. The correlated selection response in Dm was also increased from 2.93 to 4.14 genetic standard deviations between G8 and G12. There was no increase in H in G12 compared to G8  due to an electric cut off problem in the incubator and M was increased. However there was a large variability of selection response in H. In G11 the selection response in H (2.79) was higher than in G8 (2.02). In G12 the correlated selection response on H measured at 36  39 and 42 weeks of age (2.59) was a more relevant value. The realized selection response for F can be compared with the theoretically expected one if selection has been done with the conventional combined selection index although that prediction of response is valid in principle for only one generation of selection. The expected selection response on F  according to the accuracy of the combined selection index on F  would be higher than the realized one. That can be explained by variation of response due to random genetic drift and sampling errors []. In addition there was a loss in selection intensity especially because some animals with a high-predicted breeding value were discarded from reproduction to avoid full sib and half sib mating. Selection to extend the fertile period was shown to be feasible [  ]. The present results confirm the absence of a selection plateau in responses up to the 11 generation. Selection was effective in increasing the number of ova that could be fertilized after a single AI with pooled Muscovy semen  and consequently the number of eggs able to develop a viable embryo. These changes considerably increased the maximum duration of the fertile period  and the physiological effects now need to be investigated. Selection brought about a correlated increase in fertility and hatchability rates according to egg set  especially for days 2–8 after AI  thereby demonstrating the feasibility of selection for a single AI per week in this strain of laying duck. This did not produce a concomitant increase in the rate of embryonic death  (previously thought to occur in fowl) which would have impaired the benefits of selection. Thus fertilization of the ova would seem to be a key point in the intergeneric crossbreeding of ducks [  ]. Nevertheless  the total mortality rate in relation to the number of fertile eggs was high (23 to 36% (G11)). It would therefore be useful to continue this selection experiment and study the long-term effects on fertility and embryo viability. A better understanding of the consequences of selection was obtained by comparing the fertility rate curves [] according to the number of days after AI in the S and C lines. The genetic variability of viability in ducks needs to be determined to evaluate the possibilities of improving mule embryo viability. The results obtained here might depend on the use of Brown Tsaiya  which is a laying duck. Nonetheless  it should be feasible to select for an extension of the fertile period in meat-type ducks such as the Peking breed  which is being used effectively as parents for commercial mule ducks. Furthermore  research can now be focused on ways to improve the viability of the hybrid mule duck embryo. Tai C: Duck breeding and artificial insemination in Taiwan.

We apologize to the readers for these errors  which are corrected in the present erratum. Table Three (see Table  of this erratum) of our recently published paper [] contains several errors. Here we present the corrected version of Table Three (see Table  of this erratum) and explain the new data. The authors regret the errors. Errors concern the computation of the  component developed by Ollivier and Foulley []. In the new version   ranged from -1 to 0.78. As aggregate diversity  is defined as a linear combination of  and contribution to between-breed diversity  column  had also to be corrected  and ranged from -0.30 to 1.18. Consequently  the Pearson correlation between  and <U+0394>was found to be -1 (instead of -0.72 in the previous version)  and the Pearson correlation between  and <U+0394>was found to be -0.59 ( = 0.008). In spite of the above modifications  the populations that contributed most to the total diversity  according to the approaches of Ollivier and Foulley [] and Caballero and Toro []  still remain mostly the non-endangered breeds (AR  PFS  TF) [instead of AR  PS  SF  TF in the previous version]. On the contrary  when considering the eight breeds classified as endangered or endangered/maintained by the FAO (ARD  AUX  BOUL  LAND  MER  POIT  POT  TDN) and the approach of Ollivier and Foulley []  a change is noted for the breeds exhibiting the highest contributions to aggregate diversity   which are now MER  LAND and POT  instead of BOUL  MER and POIT. Finally  since the discussion on breed conservation is based on the use of several other methods and parameters  the above new results do not change our recommendations on which breeds specifically need support.

In order to test different models  simulated data with genotype by environment interactions  and dairy cattle data assumed to contain such interactions  were analyzed. Two animal models were compared to four sire models. Models differed in their ability to handle heterogeneous variance from different sources. Including an individual effect with a (co)variance matrix restricted to three times the sire (co)variance matrix permitted the modeling of the additive genetic variance not covered by the sire effect. This made the ability of sire models to handle heterogeneous genetic variance approximately equivalent to that of animal models. When residual variance was heterogeneous  a different approach to account for the heterogeneity of variance was needed  for example when using dairy cattle data in order to prevent overestimation of genetic heterogeneity of variance. Including environmental classes can be used to account for heterogeneous residual variance. Random regression models are widely used to describe effects that change gradually over a continuous scale  for instance in genotype by environment interaction studies  where the genotype effect is modeled as a function of the environment []. A common measurement of the interaction is the variance in the slope of the sire reaction norms   sire breeding values regressed on an environmental variable. The interaction is regarded as significant if the slope variance is significant [ [    ]]. For the estimation of genotype by environment interactions  both sire models or animal models are used  however sire models are computationally less demanding. Thus the sire model is preferred when the model is complex  the amount of data is large  or the analysis has to be repeated many times  as in QTL analyses in which testing many positions is necessary. Performing genetic analyses with a sire model gives an estimate of the \"sire-variance\"  which is one fourth of the genetic variance. The remaining genetic variance (3/4) is modeled through the residual term together with the environmental variance. When the genetic variance is heterogeneous because of genotype by environment interactions  the residual variance will also be heterogeneous since part of it is genetic. Therefore  a random regression model that also accounts for heterogeneous residual variance is preferred [  ]. One way to account for heterogeneous residual variance over environments is to divide the environment into classes and to assume homogeneous variance within each environmental class  but with different residual variances across classes []. The drawbacks of this method are that classes have to be arbitrarily defined and that the number of classes increases with the number of parameters that need to be estimated []. A more advantageous approach would be to model the residual variance as a function of the environment in the mixed model  but commonly used software does not facilitate this option []. Another possibility would be to add an extra term in the model  with a variance equal to three times the sire variance  which would model the part of the residual variance that is heterogeneous because of genetic heterogeneity. This term would be especially designed to capture residual variance originating from the genetic variance not modeled by the sire-term  but would not cover the heterogeneity of residual variance due to other origins. The aim of this study was to compare available random regression models with regards to their ability to give unbiased estimates of genotype by environment interactions. Two animal models were compared to four sire models that differed in the modeling of residual variance. To test the models' ability to account for the heterogeneity of variance  two kinds of data were analyzed. Simulated data were generated to contain heterogeneous genetic variance  but homogeneous residual variance. In addition  dairy cattle data  in which both genetic and residual variances were assumed heterogeneous  were used to test the ability of the different models to model the variance heterogeneity. Animal models and sire models differ in that animal models only model non-genetic variance in the residual term  while sire models also model part of the genetic variance in the residual term. Three classes of models were compared in this study. In addition to regular sire models and animal models  we applied sire models extended with a term to capture the remaining genetic variance not modeled by the sire-term. Within each of these classes of models  a model assuming homogeneous residual variance was compared to a model accounting for heterogeneous residual variance through the inclusion of environmental classes. All models are described below. The animal models are described by =  + + a+   where is the phenotypic value of daughter    is the fixed effects  which includes only the overall mean in the simulated data and a fixed regression on  in addition to the overall mean in the real data  is the genetic effect of animal  on the intercept   is the genetic effect of animal  on the slope    where  is the relationship matrix among the animals  s and s are the genetic variances of the intercept and slope  respectively and s is the genetic covariance between the intercept and slope. is the environmental value (herd-year effect in the real data) of daughter   and is the residual  assumed either normally distributed with variance s (animal-HOM)  or homogeneous within each of 5 (simulated data) or 20 (dairy cattle data) environmental classes but varying between the classes (animal-CLASS): Var(e) =   where  is the design matrix that assigns the observations to different environmental classes  and   where  = the number of environmental classes. Which environmental class an observation belongs to is dependent on its simulated environmental value (simulated data) or estimated herd-year effect (real data). The definition of the environmental classes is described in more detail in the paragraph on statistical analysis. Sire models  IND and IC  include an individual daughter term to account for the heterogeneous genetic variance not modeled in the sire term. The IC sire model also includes environmental classes that account for the heterogeneous residual variance and is expected to perform similarly to the animal-CLASS model. The IND sire model is expected to perform similarly to the animal-HOM model. The models are described by: =  + + + + +  where    end are described as in the animal models  and are the 1 and 2 random regression coefficients of the sire of daughter     where is the relationship matrix among the sires  s and s are the sire variances of the intercept and slope  respectively and s is the sire covariance between the intercept and slope. and model the effect of each individual from the intercept and slope respectively  as a deviation from the sire effect modeling the dam and Mendelian sampling effect. The variances of  and  are constrained such that: . This restriction prevents over-parameterization of the model and inclusion of -terms in the model to increase the number of variance estimates. is the residual  either assumed normally distributed with variance s as in the animal-HOM model (IND)  or with Var(e) =  as in the animal-CLASS model (IC). The HOM and CLASS sire models omit the individual daughter term and are described by: =  + + +  where all terms are defined as above. The HOM sire model assumes a homogeneous residual variance (as animal-HOM and IND)  while the CLASS model uses environmental classes to account for the heterogeneous residual variance (as animal-CLASS and IC). Data were simulated with a heterogeneous genetic variance over an environmental scale and a homogeneous residual variance. The genetic effect of each animal was simulated and varied linearly with environment  which implies that the genetic effect was modeled by an intercept and a slope (the latter models the change of the genetic effect as environment changes). A base generation and three subsequent generations of animals were simulated. Generation 0 consisted of 100 unrelated animals  50 males and 50 females  with random sampled genetic values for intercept (~N(0 0.3)) and slope (~N(0 0.016)). The genetic covariance between the intercept and slope was 0.06. Subsequent generations had breeding values drawn from the same distribution. Generation 1 consisted of 110 animals  10 males and 100 females  produced from random mating of parents from generation 0. Generation 2 consisted of 500 males created by random mating of the parents in generation 1  and 50 000 unrelated females with randomly sampled genetic values. Generation 3 consisted of 50 000 daughters of the animals in generation 2  giving each male 100 offspring and each female 1 offspring. All animals in generation 3 were attributed  in addition to genetic values  an environmental gradient env~N(0 1)  and a phenotypic value calculated as: = a+ a+   where ais the genetic value of intercept of animal  (s = 0.3)  is the genetic value for slope of animal  (s = 0.016  s = 0.06)  is the environmental gradient of animal  (env ~ N(0 1))  and is a random residual e~N(0 0.5). The heritability of the average environment was 0.375. As a result of the model used for simulations  heritability increased with increasing environmental gradient. The pedigree  phenotypes and environmental gradients of all animals in generation 3 were assumed known for the subsequent statistical analyses. The simulation was repeated 100 times. Data of the first lactation protein yield from 604 637 daughters of 734 sires were obtained from GENO breeding and AI association (the Norwegian breeding association for dairy cattle). The data were pre-corrected for heterogeneous variance due to parity and age within parity  for the fixed effects of age within parity  month of calving within parity  days open within parity  year of calving and for the random effect of herd-year. These effects were estimated with the models used in the official Norwegian breeding value estimation. The estimated random effects for herd-year were used as the environmental descriptor () in the statistical analyses. All dams of daughters where assumed unrelated when creating the relationship matrix ()  used in the animal models  since female relationships were unknown. All statistical analyses were performed with the ASREML package []. The dairy cattle data were analyzed using all six models  while the animal-CLASS and sire IC models were omitted when analyzing simulated data. Since the simulated data did not include heterogeneous residual variance  these models were not believed to perform better than the corresponding models with homogeneous residual variance. The environmental classes for the simulated data were defined with environments <-1.5 in class 1  environments =-1.5 and <-0.5 in class 2  environments =-0.5 and <0.5 in class 3  environments =0.5 and <1.5 in class 4 and environments =1.5 in class 5. For the dairy cattle data  the environmental classes were defined with 5 kg of protein within each class in environments between -45 and 45  and with one class capturing all environments below -45 and one class capturing all environments above 45. The environmental range between -45 and 45 captured 97.6% of the observations. Total genetic variance is modeled by three components: genetic variance of intercept  genetic variance of slope and genetic covariance between intercept and slope. Both the animal-HOM model and the sire model that includes an -term to account for 3/4 of the genetic variance (IND) gave unbiased estimates of all components (Table ). This result was expected  since the dams were assumed unrelated  making the animal model and the IND-model equivalent. The sire model with homogeneous residual variance (HOM) and the sire model with classes of environments (CLASS) overestimated all genetic variance components. The use of classes of environments to account for the heterogeneous residual variance (CLASS) slightly reduced the bias of the genetic correlation between slope and intercept  but had little impact on the other genetic variance components. Both animal-HOM and IND models gave approximately unbiased estimates of the total genetic variance over the environmental scale (Figure )  while sire HOM and CLASS models gave a slight underestimation of total genetic variance in the lowest environments and an overestimation in the highest environments. The average log-likelihoods from the different models over 100 replicated simulations are reported in Table . Animal-HOM and IND models gave the highest log-likelihood values  showing that they are the best suited to model heterogeneous genetic variance. . All the sire models were computationally much faster than the animal models. The sire models needed respectively 2% (HOM)  5% (CLASS) and 4% (IND) of the computational time required for the animal-HOM model. The log-likelihoods of the different models are reported in Table . The highest log-likelihood was obtained with model IC  which combines the use of an individual term and environmental classes  and has the same number of parameter estimates as the CLASS sire and animal-CLASS models. Residual variance was found to be heterogeneous with all models able to capture heterogeneity of residual variance. All the models that included heterogeneous residual variance gave similar estimates of residual variance for the environmental range capturing most of the data. The sire variance was heterogeneous with all models  but much more variable with the IND and animal-HOM models than with the other models (Figure )  which is probably due to the inability of animal-HOM and IND models to model residual heterogeneity of non-genetic sources. The heritability (Figure ) seemed to be approximately constant over environments when modeled by a model that included environmental classes  while more variable when modeled by a model that did not include environmental classes. Animal-HOM and IND sire models gave very similar estimates of variance components. Similarly  the animal-CLASS model gave estimates very similar to the IC-model. . HOM (purple)  CLASS (red)  IND/animal-HOM (pink) and IC/animal-CLASS (green); two models are presented with the same line if their results are too similar to be distinguishable. . HOM (purple)  CLASS (red)  IND/animal-HOM (pink) and IC/animal-CLASS (green); two models are presented with the same line if their results are too similar to be distinguishable. The HOM sire model seemed to underestimate the heritability in low-yield environments (due to an overestimation of residual variance in those environments)  and to overestimate heritability in high-yield environments (where residual variance is underestimated). IND and animal-HOM models seemed to overestimate the heritability in high environments and to underestimate heritability over most of the low-yield environmental range  caused by a biased estimation of the genetic variance  which was inflated because these models did not account for heterogeneous residual variance. Correlations between the sire breeding values obtained by the different models are reported in Table . The high correlations between breeding values obtained by the different models indicate that the ranking of animals is less affected by the choice of the model than the estimates of variances and covariances across environments. Estimation of genotype by environment interactions by random regression sire models with homogeneous residual variance can result in biased estimates of the variance components (Fig. ). Since 3/4 of the genetic variance is modeled in the residual term in the sire model  heterogeneous genetic variance causes the residual variance to be heterogeneous as well. When the sire variance is the only variance allowed to change across the environmental scale  overestimation of sire slope variance and/or genetic correlation between slope and intercept enable the model to capture some of the heterogeneity in residual variance. Consequently as expected  the sire model that assumes homogeneous residual variance (HOM)  overestimated both genetic slope variance and genetic correlation between slope and intercept in the simulated data. However  in the real data the estimated sire-variances obtained by the HOM sire model are similar to those obtained by the models accounting for heterogeneous variance by environmental classes (Figure ). In the dairy cattle data  the residual variance seems to be more heterogeneous than expected from the genetic component. The models that provided approximately unbiased estimates when analyzing simulated data (IND and animal-HOM) probably caused an overestimation of genetic slope variance and genetic correlation between slope and intercept in the real data. The term corresponding to the animal ( in the sire model and  in the animal model) is probably well suited to model the heterogeneity of residual variance  causing an increased log-likelihood  compared to HOM. Using the IND sire model  constraints in the model cause the sire-variance to be overestimated if the -term captures a larger part of the residual than 3/4 of the true genetic variance. The animal-HOM model also assumes that only the genetic variance can be heterogeneous  and thereby overestimates the heterogeneity of the genetic variance when other sources of heterogeneous variance are present. Hence  heterogeneity of residual variance  regardless of origin  should be accounted for  even in models including an -term or in animal models. IC and animal-CLASS models can do it. Table  shows that the largest gain in log-likelihood when analyzing real data is obtained by fitting environmental classes  defending the increased number of variance components in the model. Using environmental classes to account for heterogeneous residual variance has the advantage that no assumption has to be made about the shape of the residual variance curve. However  the drawback is that the residual variance is assumed to change only at certain arbitrarily defined environmental values  rather than to follow a continuous curve. The IND sire model gives a higher log-likelihood than the animal model (Table )  and the variance components estimated by the two models are very similar but not equal. The same holds for the sire model IC versus the animal-CLASS model. Sire models containing an -term would be equivalent to animal models in cases where the females are unrelated (as in the simulated data) or unknown (like in the real data). The latter is only strictly true if the sires are non-inbred  because with inbred sires  the within sire genetic variance is expected to be slightly smaller than three times the sire variance  and the animal model accounts for this reduction in variance because of inbreeding. When the IND sire model gives a higher log-likelihood than the animal-HOM model and the IC model gives a higher likelihood than the animal-CLASS model  this implies that the true genetic variance is constant or increasing over generations instead of decreasing because of the accumulation of inbreeding. Differences between the animal models and the corresponding sire models are so small that the variance estimates between the models cannot be distinguished in the figures (Figures  and )  and the correlations between breeding values from these models are approximately 1 (Table ). When ignoring relationships between sires  animal-HOM and IND sire models give the exact same log-likelihood as well as the exact same variance components (result not shown). Genetic variance is often maintained over multiple generations of selection  even though  in theory  inbreeding should reduce genetic variance []. Animal models might give more unbiased estimates of variance components than sire models with -terms if female relationships were known and could be properly accounted for. All sire models are more computer efficient as compared to animal models  which is important if the amount of data is large or if the analysis has to be repeated many times  as in QTL by environment interaction analyses []. In such cases  at least if female relationships cannot be accounted for  sire models with -terms should be preferred over animal models. If we remove the constraint that the -variance is three times the sire-variance from the IND sire model  it could prevent overestimation of the sire-variance because of bias in the -term. However  this model would then be over-parameterized because the -term is allowed to absorb the residual term. ASReml has reported singularities in average information matrix when such an unconstrained IND sire model is fitted. One of the benefits of replacing environmental classes (CLASS) with an -term (IND) is the reduction of the number of parameters in the model. Combining IND and CLASS in the IC model gives equally many parameters as CLASS  and the advantages of including the -term in addition to environmental classes can therefore be discussed. However  including an -term increases the log-likelihood significantly without increasing the number of parameters to be estimated by the model (Table ); the IC model is more than 8 million times more likely than the CLASS model. The IC model gives a smoother estimate of the residual variance curve over environments  causing more accurate estimates of the residual variances close to the limits between the environmental classes. This is probably why this model fits the data better. Using the IC sire model gives a slightly higher heritability in high-yield environments and lower heritability in low-yield environments  compared to the CLASS sire model. In cases where the residual variance is known to be homogeneous  including an -term could be useful to capture the part of the genetic variance not covered by the sire-term in the sire model. This might be useful for instance in survival models and analyses of categorical data  where residuals are often not explicitly included in the model and thus assumed to have homogeneous residual variance at the underlying scale. Using an individual term to model the genetic effect not covered by the sire-effect seems to be an adequate way to model heterogeneous residual variance caused by heterogeneity of genetic variance. However  in cases where heterogeneity in residual variance has other origins  these models may overestimate genetic variance. These problems are common to both sire models including an -term and the widely used animal models. Environmental classes can be used in these cases to capture the non-genetic part of the residual variance.

PCR and PLSR showed greater bias than 'BayesB' in predicting breeding values at all densities. Although  the PLSR and PCR were computationally faster and simpler  these advantages do not outweigh the reduction in accuracy  and there is a benefit in obtaining relevant prior information from the distribution of gene effects. Approaches to the use of data from molecular markers in genetic evaluation for predicting breeding values have undergone considerable development as dense genome-wide marker technologies  such as high-density  high-throughput SNP chips  have become available. Currently  considerable attention is being paid to genomic selection with the approach of predicting genome-wide breeding values. Studies have demonstrated that the potential accuracies from dense molecular information are impressive   [[–]  and []]. For example  [] showed that it was possible to predict breeding values of unrecorded offspring using genomic selection with accuracies of 0.86 with only a small bias  for a trait with heritability 0.5  1000 phenotypes and an effective population size of N = 100. Whilst in general  the accuracies of evaluation will depend on a number of factors  one issue related to implementation is the computational demand. In []  a Bayesian approach  'BayesB' was used  which was computationally time-consuming and required some prior assumptions to be made concerning the potential number of QTL segregating and the prior distributions for QTL and marker effects. This increase in the scale of molecular information results in data where  typically  the number of predictors (markers) is larger than the number of records (phenotypes). This statistical problem has been considered before  and several methods based on the multivariate regression theory  such as partial least square regression  (PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR) have been used for such situations. Both these techniques reduce the dimensionality of the set of regression variables by finding a small number of linear combinations of the original predictors  but the strategy for finding the linear combinations differ between the two methods. The regression methods have found fields of application primarily in chemometrics  econometrics and social sciences  [  ]  but there have been only very few studies using PLSR and PCR concerned with their suitability for prediction of breeding values using large-scale molecular data   [  ]. Therefore  one option for reducing the computational burden of 'BayesB' and for avoiding the use of prior distribution for marker effects is to make use of the simpler and faster PLSR and PCR algorithms. However  these algorithms have not been tested sufficiently in the context of genome-wide breeding value estimation   against 'BayesB' results  to decide upon their desirability of use. The study tested the hypothesis that an effective evaluation using genome-wide molecular data could be obtained using regression models of reduced dimensionality. Both PLSR and PCR were compared to the 'BayesB' for their accuracy and bias in predicting genome-wide breeding values. The simulation model was described in detail in an earlier paper []. Briefly  a population with an effective population size of N = 100 was simulated over 1000 generations of random selection and mating with its genome subject to mutation. In generation  = 1001  the number of animals was increased to 1000 animals by factorial mating of 50 sires (i = 1–50) and 50 dams (i = 51–100) from generation 1000. The factorial mating was achieved by mating sire 1 to dams 51–70  sire 2 to dams 52–71  sire 3 to dams 53–72 and so on  and each dam had one offspring per sire. Animals in generation  = 1001 had 1000 offspring in generation  = 1002  produced by random mating among the parents in generation  = 1001. Animals in both generation  = 1001 and  = 1002 were genotyped for SNP markers. The size and structure of the genome were the same as described in [] so that a direct comparison of the results was possible. The genome was simulated with 10 chromosomes each with a length of 100 cM each. Four density schemes of 1  2  4 and 8 markers/cM was evaluated  resulting in a total number of 1010  2020  4040 and 8080 markers across the 10 Morgan (M) genome. This would correspond to approximately 4000 to 32000 SNP markers in the Atlantic salmon () genome  assuming a 40 M genome  or 3000 to 24000 SNP in the cattle genome  assuming a 30 M genome  respectively . However in this paper  densities will be scaled by the N used to generate the markers  which was N = 100 here  unless stated otherwise. This is because the linkage disequilibrium between markers is a function of 4Nc  where c is the distance between the markers and N represents the marker density. Thus  the densities correspond to 1  2  4  and 8N/M and will be expressed in this way throughout the paper. The mutation rate of the markers was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 per locus per meiosis and with this mutation rate  99% of the potential markers were segregating at  = 1001. Markers with more than two alleles segregating at  = 1001 were converted to SNP as described in [] so that the allele frequencies were as close as possible to 0.5. The typical distribution of the minor allele frequencies of the SNP markers at  = 1001 resembled a uniform distribution with an over-representation of markers with intermediate frequencies  which reflected the selection of the most informative markers that is undertaken in practice. The potential number of QTL was kept at 100 per chromosome  distributed evenly over each chromosome (see Fig. ). The actual number of segregating QTL at  = 1001 depended on the mutation rate which was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 per locus per meiosis and resulted in the number of segregating QTL being typically 5 to 6% of the potential number with 93% biallelic. The distribution of the QTL allele frequencies of the positive QTL resembled a U-shaped distribution. The effects of a mutational allele of the QTL were sampled from the gamma distribution with the shape parameter of 1.66 and scale parameter of 0.4 [] with an equal probability of a positive or negative effect. . M  M  ...M indicate the marker position  Q  Q  ...Q indicate the QTL position. The number of markers varied from 1N/M (101 markers per chromosome) to 8N/M (808 markers per chromosome). The number of QTL was kept constant at 100 per chromosome. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) that is generated by this population structure is described in []. The r-squared value increased when the marker density increased  and followed the expected value of r-squared well when allowing for mutations. Since the r-squared estimates were close to their expected values  the population was assumed to be close to a state of recombination-drift balance. Phenotypic values for animals were first generated in generation  = 1001  and simulated as:  =  +   where  was the true breeding value for the 'th animal and  ~ N(0  s). The variance of the additive genetic effects (s) varied somewhat from replicate to replicate  but was on average 1 (s.e = 0.118). The environmental variance (s) was kept constant and equalled 1. Hence  the heritability varied between replicates  but was on average 0.5 (s.e = 0.026) for all 20 replicates calculated from the 1N/M scheme. Three methods for estimating breeding values were compared on each replicated dataset: PLSR  PCR and 'BayesB'. The basic idea of PLSR and PCR is to reduce the number of predictors with a smaller number of linear combinations of the predictors  with the additional property of pair-wise independence within the set of the constructed variables. From here on  the term latent variables will be used for these combinations of predictors applied to PLSR  while the term principal components will be used for PCR. The main difference between PLSR and PCR is in the method for constructing the latent variables or principal components. PLSR maximises the amount of covariance between the standardized predictors and response for a given number of latent variables  so that the covariance between the set of latent variables and phenotypes is as high as possible. In contrast  PCR maximises the proportion of total variance among the original predictors explained by the set of principal components. The third method  'BayesB' makes prior assumptions on the amount of genetic variance and the distribution of gene effects  and breeding values are estimated from the data points by Bayesian methods. For PCR  the principal components associated with the largest eigenvalues of the ' matrix were extracted and used to predict the  values. The following steps were performed with PCR  when fitting c principal components: Marker genotype data was organised  as  ×  matrix ()  where  is the number of phenotypic records (1000 animals in this case)   is the number of marker genotypes. Genotypes were scored as 1 for genotype AA  0 for heterozygote (Aa or aA) and -1 for aa. Hence the size of the  matrix varied from 1000 × 1010 (for 1010 markers) to 1000 × 8080 (for 8080 markers)  with each column containing the set of genotypes for a single marker. The marker genotype matrix  and  were standardised such that each column had a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. Singular value decomposition was then performed on the  matrix to find the principal components  and the  first components enter as columns in the matrix  []. The regression coefficients were obtained as  = '  where  is a diagonal matrix of the  highest singular values obtained from step 3. Calculation of estimated breeding values (EBVs) was performed as explained in section 2.3. The correlation between TBV and EBV was calculated when  = 10  50  100  150  etc. components were fitted. The number of principal components that gave the highest correlation between TBVs and EBVs was used for each density. In PLSR  the latent variables are constructed whilst accounting for their relationship to the data    the latent variables are the combinations of the  variables that maximise the covariance with . PLSR reduces the dimension of the regression  =  +   where  is a  ×  design matrix  and  is a  × 1 data vector by performing the regression  =  +   where  is a  ×  vector of 'scores'   is a  × 1 vector of 'loadings'  and generally  <<.  is calculated as   where  is a matrix of weights. Column  of     is chosen to maximise the covariance with the data  and this is obtained by setting the corresponding weights column    proportional to the 'deflated' '. The deflated ' refers to that part of '  which is orthogonal to the earlier scores   ..  . The ' matrix was deflated similarly. The deflation of ' requires the regression of  onto the scores     =  +   where  are the loadings from this regression  and  are the residuals. We used the SIMPLS algorithm []  which for a single trait  vector becomes : Phenotypic values and marker genotype data were pre-treated and standardized in the same way as described in section 2.2.1 for PCR. set  = ';  = '; and  =   then perform steps 3–8 for h = 1  ...  :  = /sqrt(')  which are the weights for the  columns to obtain  = . The  are stored as columns in .  =   which is the regression of  on . The  are stored as columns in .  = '  which is the regression of  on . Since  is a single trait   is a scalar and is stored in the column vector .  =   standardised to have Euclidean length 1. The  is that part of   which is orthogonal to the earlier   ..   vectors.  = -'  which spans the space orthogonal to the   ..   vectors.  =   which deflates the  vector; and  = -'  which deflates the  matrix. Return to step 3. The regression coefficients of PLS regression then become  = . The correlation between TBV and EBV was calculated for  = 1  2  3  4  5  7  9  12  15 and 20 fitted latent variables. The number of latent variables    that maximised this correlation was used for each density. The 'BayesB' algorithm is described in detail and was used in earlier papers [  ]. The 'BayesB' model was used to estimate marker effects and is briefly described as  = µ + S +   where  is the vector of phenotypes   is a vector of  ones  S is the summation over all markers   is a design matrix for the 'th marker   is the vector of marker effects and  is the error. The variance of the marker effects (s) was estimated for every marker using a relevant prior distribution  which was a mixture of an inverted chi-squared distribution and a discrete probability mass at s = 0. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was used to sample s from its distribution conditional on *  (s | *)  where * denotes the data  corrected for the mean and all other genetic effects except the marker effect () []. Given s  marker effects   was sampled from a Normal distribution as prior and using Gibbs sampling []. Estimated marker effects using 'BayesB' together with marker genotype of the animal was used to predict the breeding values  as explained in section 2.3. Breeding values for the  animals in generation  = 1002 were estimated using the SNP marker information and the phenotypes in generation  = 1001  and compared to the true breeding values (TBV) in generation  = 1002. The EBV of animal  for PLSR and PCR were obtained from: EBV= for  = 1... where denotes the 'th row of the  matrix corresponding to the set of genotypes for animal    is the regression coefficient vector of method   where  denotes PCR or PLSR  and is estimated from the data in generation  = 1001. For 'BayesB' the EBVs were calculated from: where denotes the row of the matrix corresponding to the genotype of animal  at locus   and  is the estimate of the marker effects for locus   estimated in generation  = 1001. TBV were linearly regressed on EBV  where the regression coefficient reflects the bias of the breeding value estimates (a regression coefficient of one denotes unbiased estimates)  and the correlation coefficient reflects the accuracy of predicting the breeding values. Figures  and  show the correlation of TBV with EBV and the regression of TBV on EBV as a function of the number of principal components for PCR. For the three lowest marker densities  1N/M  2N/M and 4N/M  the correlation reached a maximum when 250 principal components were fitted. For the 8N/M marker density  the correlation reached a maximum when 350 principal components were fitted. After reaching the highest correlation between TBV and EBV  the correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV was approximately maintained until dropping more steeply when the number of principal components exceeded 400 (Fig. ). The regression coefficient decreased almost linearly  and hence the bias increased  as more principal components were fitted (Fig. ). In the following tables and comparisons  the results from fitting 250 principal components were chosen for 1N/M  2N/M and 4N/M marker density schemes  while 350 principal components were chosen for the 8N/M marker density scheme  since this achieved the highest correlation between TBV and EBV with PCR. . . The correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV and the regression coefficient of TBV on EBV resulting from varying the number of latent variables from 1 to 20 are shown in Figures  and   respectively. Starting with one latent variable  the correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV increased until it reached a maximum between 2–4 latent variables (Fig. ). The regression of TBV on EBV was close to 1 when only one latent variable was fitted  and dropped rapidly as more latent variables were added to the model (Fig. ). In the following tables and comparisons the results from fitting two latent variables for the marker densities 1N/M  2N/M and 4N/M were chosen  while four latent variables were chosen for the 8N/M marker density scheme  since this achieved the highest correlation between TBV and EBV with PLSR. . . The correlation coefficients between TBV and EBV for the different marker densities and estimation methods together with their standard error are given in Table . The accuracy of estimating the breeding values increased as the density of the markers increased  as expected  since more information was available when more markers were fitted to the model. For PLSR  the correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV for the four densities (1  2  4 and 8N/M) was 0.611  0.655  0.670 and 0.681  respectively. This was marginally greater than using PCR  which varied in a similar fashion from 0.604 to 0.665. Compared within densities the differences between PCR and PLSR were not significant  but across all densities PLSR gave a higher correlation than PCR by 0.016 (s.e = 0.008). The correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV for 'BayesB' was 8% greater than PLSR for the lowest marker density  and 18% greater for the highest marker density. Hence  the gap in accuracy between PLSR/PCR and 'BayesB' increased as the marker density increased. The regression coefficients of TBV on EBV are summarized in Table . The most evident result is that this regression was higher for 'BayesB' compared to the regression methods  PLSR and PCR: the mean coefficient for 'BayesB' was > 0.87 for all marker densities  but was always < 0.76 for the regression methods  and this difference was large compared to the standard errors obtained. For 'BayesB' there was statistical evidence for a trend towards regression coefficients increasing towards 1 as marker densities increased. For the two regression methods  the pattern was more complex. More principal components and latent variables were fitted to optimise the correlations shown in Table  for 8N/M than in scenarios with lower marker density   350 principal components and four latent variables were used for 8N/M  while 250 principal components and two latent variables were used for PCR and PLSR respectively for the lower marker density schemes. Figures  and  show clearly that the regression coefficient decreases as the number of principal components or latent variables increase for both methods. With this caveat  at low densities (1  2 and 4 N/M) it appeared that the PLSR method resulted in greater regression coefficients than PCR (a difference of 0.07 with s.e = 0.01 over these densities)  but this was reversed in favour of PCR (0.036 with s.e = 0.018) at 8N/M. The regression coefficients for PCR appeared more stable compared to PLSR and exhibited a trend to greater regression coefficients as marker density increased. Compared to the 'BayesB' method  the presented multivariate regression methods used much less computational time. The computer time for estimating the marker effects using the PCR  PLSR and 'BayesB' is presented in Table . The machine was an  with eight processors (EV7)  of which only one processor was used at a time. PLSR used about 3 min per replicate to compute the marker effects for all marker densities  while PCR used somewhat longer time to calculate the marker effects  especially for higher marker densities  and the gap in computation time between PLSR and PCR increased as the marker density increased. However  the computation time for PLSR/PCR was very much reduced compared to the 'BayesB':  'BayesB' used approximately 200 minutes to compute the marker effects for the lowest marker density  which was approximately 65 times longer than PLSR/PCR  and the computer time increased rapidly as the marker density increased (Table ). Two multivariate regression methods that reduce the dimensionality of the marker data were compared to a Bayesian method for the prediction of genome-wide breeding values based on SNP marker information and phenotypic records. In general  our results showed that it was possible to predict breeding values in our simulated genome using both multivariate regression methods  but the correlation between TBV and EBV were both reduced compared to those of 'BayesB'. The correlation between TBV and EBV increased as the marker density increased  because more information was available for predicting QTL genotypes  but most notably for 'BayesB'. The correlation is the accuracy of predicting EBV  whilst the regression indicates bias  and these correspondences will be used throughout the rest of the discussion. Hence  the results indicate that the regression methods deliver a lower accuracy and greater bias in predicting breeding values than 'BayesB'  and are less responsive to the addition of further marker information. The greater responsiveness to marker density of 'BayesB' was marked. For PLSR and PCR  the accuracy increased by 7% and 6% respectively from the lowest marker density (1N/M) to the highest marker density (8N/M)  whilst in contrast 'BayesB' was 17% more accurate for the highest marker density compared to the lowest density. Hence  the gap in accuracy between PLSR/PCR and 'BayesB' increased as the marker density increased. From this result  it seems that the use of relevant prior information  as in the 'BayesB' method  was more valuable as the marker density increased. Whilst the accuracy of prediction may be the primary parameter of interest  the regression of the TBV on EBV is relevant since it determines the bias in predicting genetic progress. One possible consequence is that this will contribute to decreasing the accuracy in predicting breeding values if the population used for providing estimates of breeding values spans more than a single generation of selection. In this attribute  as in accuracy  the advantage appears to lie in 'BayesB'  with regression coefficients both closer to one than PLSR and PCR and increasing as marker density increased. Although  these biases may be corrected for by scaling the EBV such that Var(EBV) = Cov(EBV  TBV)  and thus are not a major hindrance for the use of PLSR or PCR. The regression methods had increased bias as density increased because more principal components or latent variables were required to optimise the accuracy. Any use of PLSR or PCR would require optimisation on the number of principal components or latent variables  perhaps through cross-validation for each practical data set  although both accuracy and bias will depend on the number of phenotypes. The main advantages using PLSR and PCR compared to the 'BayesB' method were the computing time and avoidance of the assumptions about prior distribution of marker effects made in the 'BayesB' model. PLSR and PCR were computationally much faster and simpler compared to the 'BayesB' method   the computation time for estimating the marker effects using PLSR was approximately 65 times faster than 'BayesB' for the lowest marker density. The gap in computation time  hence the computational costs  were increased for higher marker density. For example  the expected linkage disequilibrium (LD) for the same recombination rate will be reduced by doubling the effective population size N. Hence  assuming the accuracy is primarily determined by the amount of LD  then a doubling of the number of markers is needed to achieve the same LD  a finding supported by []. Doubling the number of markers will double or triple the computation time needed  which is especially time consuming for 'BayesB'. Compared to PLSR and PCR  'BayesB' has a greater potential for exploiting parallel computing  which was not used in this study  therefore the relative computational benefits of PLSR and PCR will diminish as parallel processing becomes cheaper and more common. This parallel computing implementation of BayesB will be highly needed because the number of markers is expected to increase for most species to 50 – 500 thousand. Meuwissen . [] used microsatellites at 1 N/M density to compare least square regression after screening for significant QTL  BLUP and 'BayesB' for predicting genome-wide breeding values  and found accuracies of 0.318  0.732 and 0.848  respectively. Solberg  [] determined that SNP densities of 2- to 3-fold greater densities were required to achieve comparable accuracies. Therefore  an appropriate comparison may be made with the results of [] with SNP at a density of 4N/M in our study. For this density  PLSR and PCR had accuracies of 0.670 and 0.645. Hence  these results indicate that the Bayesian method 'BayesB' gave the highest accuracy  followed by BLUP  PLSR and PCR  and least square analysis combined with screening had the lowest accuracy. A somewhat high heritability was used in this simulation study  therefore a comparison of the three methods BayesB  PLSR and PCR were additionally evaluated for a lower heritability of 0.25 (Table ). For the highest marker density  the selection accuracy was reduced by 7% for the BayesB method  and 16% for the two regression methods. For the lowest marker density  the selection accuracy was reduced by 14% for the regression methods and 12% for the BayesB method. No significant differences were observed between the PLSR and PCR. Even if the selection accuracy was reduced in all cases  the same \"ranking\" of the methods remain  namely  BayesB performed better than PLSR and PCR. A conclusion from this study is that if some relevant information is known  then methods that utilize relevant prior information will be more accurate. The 'BayesB' method assumed a mixture of distributions of an inverted chi-square with a discrete probability mass at zero as the relevant prior distribution of marker effects  to model an increase in the number of markers with an effect of zero. The simulated QTL effects followed a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 1.66 and a scale parameter of 0.4 [] with equal probability of positive or negative effects. In practice  we do not know the exact distribution of the QTL effects. Although the distribution used for simulating the QTL effects and that used for analysing the data did not agree exactly  'BayesB' approximates the prior distribution of the QTL effects better than the regression methods. From a Bayesian perspective  PLSR and PCR might be viewed as representing a limiting form where the prior distribution for regression coefficients is normally distributed with an increasingly large variance. This closer correspondence between the prior used for evaluation and the simulated distribution of QTL perhaps explains in part the higher accuracies obtained with 'BayesB'. PLSR and PCR give an alternative solution to 'BayesB' to estimate marker effects. They provide a rapid analysis of large amounts of data to obtain EBVs from high-density markers. The only assumptions are the additivity of marker effects  and that few linear combinations of markers can explain most variability in the data. However  whilst this simulation study showed that reducing the dimensionality of the data gave a reasonably high accuracy of selection  the accuracy was less than that obtained from 'BayesB'  and this difference increased with increasing marker density. To obtain full benefits of genome-wide selection  use of relevant  information about the distribution of the QTL effects is preferable  since genotyping costs are very high relative to computational costs. These relevant prior distributions need to be obtained by acquiring greater knowledge of the genomic architecture.

This AFLP linkage map provides important information for establishing a duck chromosome map  for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL mapping) and for breeding applications. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) is an application of the DNA fingerprinting technique proposed by Vos . []  which is a clever combination of two older methods  restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [] and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [–]  generating a large number of genetic markers from any genomic DNA []. AFLP markers are inherited in a Mendelian fashion and can be detected as co-dominant markers []. Since Ajmone-Marsan . []  several studies have shown that AFLP markers follow Mendelian inheritance rules and that the technique is highly reproducible  powerful and efficient []. Thus AFLP analysis is a useful tool to generate linkage maps []. Linkage maps using AFLP  microsatellite or SNP markers have been established and applied extensively to linkage studies or quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in animals such as rats []  rabbits []  goats []  sheep []  cattle []  chickens [–]  turkeys []  quails [  ]  and fish [  ]. They have also been much used for genome mapping  studies on disease resistance and drug tolerance in economic crops and other experimental plants such as sorghum []   []  rice []  corn []  barley [] and wheat []. Ducks are appreciated for meat and eggs. Research on duck genetics and breeding has been developed only in recent years []. For detecting and mapping QTL  the construction of a genetic linkage map is a prerequisite and in duck genetic map data are very limited. Huang . [] have reported a preliminary genetic linkage map in an inbred Pekin ducks resource population using microsatellite markers. The advantage of AFLP is that a large number of markers can be generated with a smaller number of primer pairs than required when using microsatellites. This is especially true when working in a species for which only few microsatellite markers are available. A large number of microsatellite markers may be obtained if enough time and financial support are available. In this study  we have chosen the AFLP technique to develop a duck genetic map. We have used the  I/ RI restriction enzyme combination and selective PCR primers to generate molecular genetic markers and to establish a duck genetic linkage map from a resource population originating from a cross between two outbred selected lines of laying and meat type ducks. This is a first step to provide vital information to construct chromosome maps and map QTL for future applications in duck breeding. All ducks tested in the study originate from the Livestock Research Institute  Council of Agriculture (LRI-COA). In the first generation F0  each of three brown Tsaiya drakes and three Pekin drakes were mated either to two Pekin ducks or to two brown Tsaiya female ducks  respectively. Six F1 drakes originating from the six F0 sires were mated individually  according to the mating plan  with three (one case) or six (five cases) unrelated F1 dams that were daughters of one F0 drake of the same breed brown Tsaiya or Pekin. F2 birds belonging to six half-sib families were used as the mapping population. The number of birds in the resource population was as follows: six males and 12 females in the F0  six males and 33 females in the F1 and 766 males and females in the F2. A total of 766 F2 animals were genotyped. Blood samples obtained from the vein of the ducks wings were carefully mixed with anticoagulant and kept at 4°C for subsequent DNA extraction. DNA extraction procedures were performed according to the method described by Huang . []. Eighty µL of each blood sample were mixed thoroughly with 1 mL of TNE buffer solution (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0  150 mM NaCl  10 mM EDTA pH 8.0) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1 500 × g (Hermle Model Z233 MK  Maryland  USA) for 5 min to wash the cells. They were then resuspended in 300 µL 10% NHCl  75 µL proteinase K (10 mg/mL)  25 µL collagenase (3.8 IU/µL)  and 200 µL 10% w/v SDS and the mixture was incubated at 42°C for 24 h  with agitation. A series of extractions was performed with a same volume of phenol  phenol/chloroform (containing 1/25 v/v isoamyl alcohol)  and chloroform  respectively. Centrifugation conditions were 3 000 × g (Model SCT5B  HITACHI) for 10 min  then samples were precipitated with isopropanol. Excess isopropanol was removed using 70% ethanol. The DNA was vacuum-dried (Speed Vac SC110  Rotor RH 40-11  SAVANT) and resuspended in double distilled water. The DNA was quantified with an S2000 UV/Vis Diode-Array Spectrophotometer (WAP Co. Ltd.  Cambridge  UK) to determine its absorbance and to confirm DNA purity and concentration for AFLP analysis. AFLP analysis was carried out according to the procedures described by Vos . []. All sequences for the  RI and  I adapters and primers used in this study are shown in Table . Briefly  400–500 ng of genomic DNA (50 ng/µL) was digested with 0.5 µL  RI restriction endonuclease (20 U/µL) with 1 µL of 10×  RI buffer (50 mM NaCl  100 mM Tris-HCl  10 mM MgCl  0.025% Triton X-100  pH 7.5) (New England BioLabs Inc.  Ipswich  MA  USA) in a total volume of 10 µL. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 4 h and then at 65°C for 10 min. Subsequently  the sample was digested with 0.5 µL  I restriction endonuclease (20 U/µL) with 1.5 µL of 10×  I buffer (100 mM NaCl  10 mM Tris-HCl  10 mM MgCl pH 8.4) (New England BioLabs Inc.  Ipswich  MA  USA)  then mixed with 0.15 µL of 100× BSA in a total volume of 15 µL and incubated at 65°C for 4 h with a last step at 80°C for 10 min. Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 1 µL of  I-adaptor (50 ng/µL)  0.1 µL of  RI-adaptor (50 ng/µL)  1 µL of T4 DNA ligase (1 U/µL) and 5 µL of 5× ligase buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6  50 mM MgCl  5 mM ATP  5 mM DTT  25% polyethylene glycol-8000) (Invitrogen Co.  Carlsbad  CA  USA). The mixture was made up to 25 µL with double-distilled water and incubated at 23°C for 12 h. DNA pre-amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems  Singapore) with a final volume of 20 µL containing 6 µL of the DNA sample  1 µL of  I+A primer (50 ng/µL)  1 µL of  RI+A primer (50 ng/µL)  1.6 µL of 2.5 mM dNTPs  0.25 µL of DyNAzyme™ DNA polymerase (2 U/µL  F-501L  Finnzymes Oy  Espoo  Finland)  and 2 µL of 10× PCR buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8  15 mM MgCl  500 mM KCl  1% Triton X-100). The following PCR conditions were used: a denaturing step for 5 min at 94°C  20 cycles at 94°C for 30 s  56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. A second PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 5 µL containing 0.5 µL of the pre-amplification PCR products  1 µL of  I+A selective primer (50 ng/µL)  1 µL fluorescent dye-labeled  RI+A selective primer (50 ng/µL) with either VIC (green)  NED (yellow)  PET (red) or FAM (blue) 0.3 µL of 2.5 mM dNTPs  0.25 µL of DyNazyme™ DNA polymerase (2 U/µL)  and 0.5 µL of 10× buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3  1.5 mM MgCl  50 mM KCl). Conditions for the selective amplification PCR are shown in Table . Equal volumes of each of the four PCR products with different color fluorescent markers (either VIC  NED  PET or FAM) were combined  diluted and mixed with double-distilled water and mixed. Then  1 µL of the diluted PCR product mixture was added to 0.2 µL of GeneScan-500 LIZ internal lane size standard (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA) and 10.8 µL of deionized formamide  denatured for 3 min at 94°C and immediately after placed on ice for 5 min. Capillary electrophoresis was performed on an ABI PRISM 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer using the GS STR POP-6 F module column (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA). Fluorescent peak signals for each primer combination were collected with the ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer Data Collection 1.1 (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA). The resulting genotyping data were scanned and analyzed with the software ABI PRISM™ GeneScan 3.7 and Genotyper 3.7 software package (Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA  USA)  which displayed the AFLP fingerprints and quantified the polymorphic peaks. AFLP markers were named according to the serial number based on the extension sequence of  I and  RI primer combination (Table ) and to the size of the fragment in base pairs. Polymorphic markers from duck individuals belonging to the same family were scored according to the different heights and distributions of peak signals using the Genotyper software. Each polymorphic marker was analyzed by Chi-square tests. Markers heterozygous in both F1 parents and significantly ( = 0.05) fitting a 1:2:1 ratio (Mendelian inheritance) with the ratio of the numbers of individual genotypes A  H and B  were counted. Linkage analysis was performed by CarteBlanche software (Keygene  Wageningen  Netherlands) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly  each F2 genotype data from every family was imported. Linkage groups were constructed by the 'linkage phase establishment' function  calculating the recombination frequency () between pairs of markers and the decimal logarithm of the odds ratio score (LOD score). Significant linkage was defined by a LOD score = 3.0. Map distances were calculated according to the Kosambi mapping function. The linkage maps were drawn by MapChart 2.2 [] and denominated in accordance to the calculated length orders of linkage groups. The number and the size range of the detected AFLP polymorphisms are shown in Table . Two hundred and ninety-six polymorphic markers (64% of all peaks) were produced. Each primer pair produced between seven and 29 polymorphic markers (16.4 markers on average). This indicated that multicolor fluorescence detection with AFLP markers is a high throughput  timesaving and easily analyzed DNA fingerprinting technique. It can be applied to investigate genetic linkage and polymorphism in a population. Histograms  created by ABI PRISM™ Genotyper 3.7 of signal heights from an AFLP marker  are shown in Figure  and can be classified into three genotypes: homozygous present (A)  heterozygous (H) and homozygous absent (B). Genotype data that were missed or could not be scored are indicated as genotype (U). After polymorphism analysis and <U+03C7> tests  281 AFLP markers obtained from the genomic DNA of six duck families could be used for linkage analysis. Phases of all the linkage group markers were established by the 'linkage phase establishment' function in the CarteBlanche software (Keygene  Wageningen  Netherlands). Calculating recombination frequencies ()  LOD scores and map distances for markers in each linkage group provided an optimum order of markers. Then  linkage maps were constructed using MapChart 2.2 [] and they were denominated according to the calculated length orders of the linkage groups. Figure  shows the linkage group maps comprising 260 markers placed in 32 linkage groups. Twenty-one markers were not linked with any other marker. The number of markers in each linkage group ranged between three and 63 with 11 major groups containing 7 to 63 markers and 21 minor groups containing three to four markers. One hundred and fifty-seven of the mapped markers (60%) originated from seven linkage groups containing 10 to 63 markers. The lengths of the linkage groups varied between 19.9 and 171.9 cM. The total length of the map was 1 766 cM  with an average interval distance of 7.75 cM between two consecutive markers  the spacing between adjacent markers ranging from 0.0 cM to 33.3 cM. The results of the marker density analysis showed that the linkage group LG-1 had the highest density with 63 markers for 171 cM  whilst the LG-11 linkage group had the lowest density with three markers for 61.4 cM. . Three categories are manually defined  displaying signals characterized as genotype (B) when the marker is homozygous absent  genotype (H) when the marker is heterozygous  and genotype (A) when the marker is homozygous present. Signals outside the categories are characterized as genotype (U). . Two hundred and sixty of the markers were assigned to 32 linkage groups in six families by CarteBlanche linkage software. Map distances (centimorgan  cM) were indicated to the left of the maps and calculated using the Kosambi mapping function. The names of the markers are indicated to the right of the maps. One purpose of the resource population produced in this work was to generate individuals with a maximum of heterozygous markers in its F1 generation. This resource population originated from a cross between two genetically different lines: a laying brown Tsaiya line selected for long duration of fertility [  ] and a Pekin duck line selected as grand parent to produce mule ducks for roasting. Six F1 drakes from the six F0 sires were each mated with three (one case) or six (five cases) unrelated F1 dams  which were daughters of one F0 drake of the same breed brown Tsaiya or Pekin. Using AFLP markers to screen genotypes on every F2 individual from each family  we found that 281 markers (60% of all bands) conformed to Mendelian segregation. These genotype results demonstrate that pedigree information from integrated family generations is important for scoring AFLP marker genotypes. In this duck population  we observed very little segregation distortion and genotyping errors. These results show also that AFLPs can be scored as bi-allelic co-dominant markers in ducks  increasing the information content when compared to bi-allelic dominant markers and facilitating linkage and QTL analyses. Using primer combinations labeled with multicolor fluorescent dyes and a fragment scanning system from ABI PRISM 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer  it will be possible to greatly increase the quantity and density of markers in a linkage group to build more detailed and better integrated genetic linkage maps. Due to the GC rich and gene-dense nature of bird microchromosomes [  ]  double digestion with  RI and  I restriction enzymes was performed. The sequences of adapters and primers (Table ) and the conditions of selective amplification PCR (Table ) were designed and adapted according to the method described by Herbergs . []. The average number of polymorphic fragments generated by each primer pair was 8.5 []  10.5 [] in chickens and 18 in quails []. Our results indicate that in duck the average number of fragments is 16.4. This discrepancy may be due to species differences and to differences in the selection of primer combinations. The present results demonstrate that AFLP can produce a large amount of polymorphic markers in duck genomic DNA (Table ). Therefore  AFLP markers are useful for linkage analysis in ducks. For a given number of informative meiosis  the higher the LOD score  the closer the distance between two markers  which means there is a high probability that the two markers are located in the same linkage group. The map is relatively dense with an average interval distance between adjacent markers of 7.75 cM. The large number of chromosomes (2 = 80) and especially the presence of microchromosomes []  make it difficult to build an exhaustive map and thus the number of linkage groups is smaller than the number of chromosome pairs. However  AFLP markers are expected to provide a better coverage of microchromosomes than microsatellite markers [  ]. Currently  the use of AFLP marker analysis to establish a genetic linkage map is mainly restricted to plant studies []. A recent study applied the microsatellite technique to establish a preliminary genetic linkage map in an inbred Pekin duck resource population []. When comparing the results with our current study (Figure )  AFLP markers produced a higher number of linkage groups (32  19) and an increased marker density (average interval distance 7.75 cM  15.04 cM). This difference is mainly caused by the use of different molecular markers  resource populations and analysis methods. However  the microsatellite map made it possible to construct in parallel a cytogenetic map  which is not possible with AFLP markers. Thus  AFLP and microsatellite markers each have their advantages and drawbacks. To date  no large and integrated duck map is available for analysis and comparison. The successful establishment of a duck linkage map using AFLP genetic markers (Figure ) in this study provides important information to integrate the published microsatellite markers  to set up a duck chromosome map  to map QTL and to develop future breeding applications.

These results indicate that SSCX is important for physical and chemical body composition and accretion as well as feed intake regulation. To understand the genetic control of economically important traits in pigs a large number of studies have investigated QTL that contribute to variation in these traits . [–]. Most QTL have been identified on autosomes with only a few on the sex chromosomes. One reason may be that the role of sex chromosomes in the genomic regulation of these traits is less important. Another reason may come from the fact that  until recently  software modelling more appropriately the specific features of sex chromosomes was not available. Indeed  the mammalian X chromosome is considerably larger than the Y chromosome and carries more genes [  ]. For example  1 250 genes are known on the human X chromosome but only 147 on the Y chromosome []. As a result  female cells  which carry two copies of the X chromosome  contain twice as many X-linked genes than males. Mammals have developed a mechanism to balance the dosage of the X chromosome genes between sexes  called the dosage compensation phenomenon [  ]. Furthermore  chromosomes X and Y only share a small homologous region called the pseudoautosomal region []. Because QTL mapping software taking into account the specific X chromosome features was not available  most studies have adopted a regression based approach analyzing males and females separately  which decreases the power of QTL detection . [    ]. Recently  Perez-Enciso . [] have developed software combining a mixed model methodology and a maximum likelihood approach  which can model the specific X chromosome features in a QTL analysis. Therefore  the aim of the present study was to investigate QTL on pig chromosome X (SSCX) for chemical and physical body composition and deposition using a methodology  which accurately takes into account the features associated with this chromosome. This study was based on data recorded from a three-generation full-sib design  developed from a cross between seven unrelated Pietrain grandsires  all heterozygous (Nn) at the  locus  and 16 unrelated grand-dams from a three-way cross of Leicoma boars with Landrace x Large White dams. Eight boars from the F generation  were mated to 40 sows over two parities to produce the F generation comprising 315 pigs. Forty-eight gilts and 46 barrows of the F generation were housed individually in straw-bedded pens and fed manually with a weekly recording of feed consumption. The remaining animals (117 gilts and 104 barrows) were housed in mixed sex groups of up to 15 pigs in straw-bedded pens. Animals housed in groups were fed with an electronic feeding station (ACEMA 48)  which recorded feed consumption at each visit. According to body weight ranges  three different pelleted diets were provided . containing 13.8 MJ ME/kg and 1.2% lysine for range 30–60 kg  13.8 MJ ME/kg and 1.1% lysine for 60–90 kg and 13.4 MJ ME/kg and 1.0% lysine for 90–140 kg. Maximal protein deposition was reached by providing pigs with  access to diets  which were formulated slightly above requirement. For a more detailed description of the project management see Landgraf . [  ] and Mohrmann . [  ]. Pigs were slaughtered at 140 kg body weight in a commercial abattoir. Phenotypic measurements on 37 traits related to physical body composition were collected by two methods  the AutoFOM device and dissection. The AutoFOM device used an automatic ultrasound scanning technique to produce a three-dimensional image of the pig []  which provided measurements of valuable carcass cuts  including average fat thickness  belly weight  lean content  lean content of the belly and weights of entire and trimmed shoulder  loin and ham without bones. The right side of each carcass was dissected into weights of the primal cuts  neck  shoulder  loin  ham and belly. The former four cuts were dissected into lean and fat tissue. Furthermore  weights of the jowl  thick rib  flank  front as well as hind hock  tail and claw were recorded. Further measurements were made on the cold left carcass side  for carcass length  sidefat thickness  fat content and area of the belly as well as loin eye area  fat area  and thinnest fat measure (fat degree B) calculated at the 13/14 rib interface. Landgraf . [] have described more precisely the dissection of carcasses. Phenotypic information was obtained for 25 traits related to chemical body composition and deposition. Protein content of the loin and intramuscular fat content were measured by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy in the . The deuterium dilution technique  an  method determining chemical body composition based on body water was used to determine protein  lipid and ash contents of the empty body at target body weights of 30  60  90  120  and 140 kg. The accuracy of this technique has been verified in previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging on live animals [] and chemical analysis of serially-slaughtered animals []. This method measures the water content of the empty body  from which the percentage of fat-free substance of the empty body can be estimated. Based on the percentage of the fat-free substance  protein and ash content of the empty body are estimated  and lipid content is the deviation of the fat-free content from one. The equations for estimating these chemical components were developed by Landgraf . [] using the data of the F generation of the three-generation full-sib population analyzed in the present study. Protein and lipid accretion rates at four stages of growth were calculated as the difference between protein or lipid composition at two consecutive target weights divided by days of growth between the target weights. Furthermore  daily gain  feed intake and food conversion ratio were recorded at different stages of growth. Means and standard deviations of the 72 traits analyzed in the present study are presented in Additional file   Table S1. Blood samples were collected from F  F and F animals from the  and DNA was isolated. All animals were genotyped for eight informative microsatellite markers covering SSCX. Markers and their distances were taken from the published USDA linkage map []  which provided all information on their positions and alleles (Table ). The average distance between markers was 18.3 cM and the largest gap was 22.4 cM. Linkage analysis was performed with Crimap []. The marker order agrees with the USDA linkage map but distances between markers differ from those in the USDA linkage map  which is probably due to the fact that the marker coverage in the present study is not as good as in the USDA map. QTL mapping was carried out using the software QxPak version 2.16 []. This program uses mixed models and the maximum likelihood method to estimate the QTL location and effects. A fixed effects model that estimates additive and dominance effects was chosen for the QTL analysis. In cases where the dominance effect was not significant  the analysis was repeated with an additive-only model. Maternal and paternal imprinting was tested for only in the pseudoautosomal region. In this analysis  the additive estimate is defined as half of the difference between animals homozygous for alleles from the grand-paternal sire line and those homozygous for alleles from the grand-maternal dam line. A positive additive genetic value indicates that the allele originating from the grand-paternal sire line (Pietrain) showed an increasing QTL effect compared to the allele from the grand-maternal dam line and . The dominance effect is defined as the deviation of heterozygous animals from the mean of both types of homozygous animals. Fixed effects and covariates were fitted in the models depending on their significance for the trait. Sex  ryanodine receptor genotype (MHS-genotype) and batch were included in the model for all traits. In addition  housing was included as a fixed effect for feed intake and food conversion ratio traits. Body weight at slaughter was fitted in the model as a covariate for carcass characteristics measured at slaughter. For chemical body composition traits measured at different target weights  body weight at that target weight was fitted in the model as a covariate. Protein and lipid accretion  daily gain  feed intake and food conversion ratio were adjusted for the small differences between target and actual body weight at the start and end of the considered weight range. The analysis provides likelihood ratios under the models tested and associated nominal P-values. A previous study by Perez-Enciso . [] has shown that nominal P-values 0.005 and 0.001 correspond to 5% and 1% chromosome-wide significant P-values  respectively  based on the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. Therefore  in the present study  nominal P-values <0.001  0.005 and 0.01 were treated as significant at the 1%  5% and suggestive at the 10% chromosome-wide level  respectively. Confidence intervals of QTL were estimated using the 1-LOD drop method []. The mixed model methodology applied in this study includes all pedigree information and uses the Maximum Likelihood Method to estimate the QTL effects. Due to the flexibility of the methodology  we were able to take into account the heterogeneity between the sex chromosomes  the presence of the pseudoautosomal region and the sex chromosome dosage compensation phenomenon. The methodology applied here is described in Perez-Enciso . [] and implemented in the programme QxPak. In more detail  the main issues relate to modelling the mammalian dosage compensation and computing the   and coefficients. is the average probability for the  th individual of a gene within segment  to originate from breed A.   is the probability of individuals  and  having received identical-by-descent (IBD) alleles of breed A(B). In the non-pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome the male phenotype is expressed as: = +  +     (1) and the female phenotype as: = +  +  + +     (2)  is sex mean; g  the genetic origin  indicates the haplotype origin  1 for male and 2 for female; is the dosage compensation effect for  th haplotype allele effect and  is the dominance interaction. In this case  interaction between alleles (dominance) can be estimated only in females. The allele contributing to the male phenotype always comes from the mother (). Parameters  and  should always add up to 1. The genetic covariances between two crossed individuals are calculated as: if  and  are both males if  is a male and  is a female if  and  are both females Where   is the probability of alleles  and  being IBD and being of breed origin A  and  is the probability of alleles  and  being IBD and being of breed origin B.  is the variance of the gene effects in breed A and  is the variance of the gene effects in breed B. We define  when  is a male and  a female. In addition  the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes has been considered. This is the homologous region between the X and Y chromosomes  thus in males  this is the only X chromosome region where recombination can occur []. The genomic analysis identified on the pig X chromosome three significant QTL and five suggestive QTL for carcass cuts  lean tissue characteristics  chemical body composition and deposition as well as daily feed intake. The additive and dominance effects of these QTL are presented in Table . Two QTL were identified with imprinting effects in the pseudoautosomal region  which are shown in Table . The correlations between these traits are presented in Additional file   Table S2. A QTL significant at the 1% chromosome-wide level was identified for entire loin weight in the pseudoautosomal region of SSCX at 7 cM between  and  explaining 3.7% of the phenotypic variance (Figure ). The significant additive effect at this QTL indicates that the grand-paternal Pietrain breed is associated with a 284 g higher loin weight. At a similar location in the pseudoautosomal region . at 11 cM  a suggestive QTL was identified for loin weight without external fat explaining 2.5% of the phenotypic variance (Figure ). The significant additive effect at this QTL indicates that the grand-paternal Pietrain breed is associated with a 185 g higher lean meat weight of the loin cut. At the telomeric end of the q arm of SSCX  at the same position as  (128.4 cM) a QTL significant at the 1% chromosome-wide level was identified for jowl weight accounting for 5.8% of the phenotypic variance (Figure ). The significant dominance effect at this QTL indicates that heterozygous animals are associated with a 217 g higher jowl weight. . Positions in cM are based on the USDA reference map. . Positions in cM are based on the USDA reference map. At the telomeric end of the q arm of SSCX  at the same position as the QTL for jowl weight and  (128.4 cM)  a QTL significant at the 5% chromosome-wide level was identified for lipid accretion rate during the growth period between 90 and 120 kg (Figure ). This QTL accounts for 3.2% of the phenotypic variance and the significant additive effect indicates that the purebred Pietrain breed is associated with a 27 g higher lipid accretion rate at this growth period. Suggestive QTL for protein content of the fat-free substance and protein and lipid content of the empty body were identified between  and  at 82–83 cM explaining 3.1  3.8 and 3.3% of the phenotypic variance  respectively (Figure ). These traits showed similar likelihood ratio profiles as they are closely correlated (Additional file   Table S2). Pietrain alleles associated with decreased additive genetic effects of protein content of the fat-free substance are found at these QTL and heterozygous animals showed dominance effects associated with increased lipid content of the empty body  decreased protein content of the empty body and increased protein content of the fat-free substance at 30 kg body weight. A single suggestive QTL was identified for daily feed intake at a late stage of growth (120–140 kg) in a region of SSCX (56 cM) where no other QTL were identified (Figure ). This QTL accounts for 2.3% of the phenotypic variance and the significant additive effect indicates that Pietrain alleles are associated with a 102 g/day higher feed intake at this stage of growth. Two QTL with significant imprinting effects were identified in the pseudoautosomal region (Table ). At 6 cM  significant paternal imprinting effects were identified for entire loin weight  indicating that only the maternal allele is expressed at this QTL. A QTL with significant maternal imprinting effects was identified at 1 cM for neck weight without external fat  indicating that only the paternal allele is expressed at this QTL. This QTL for neck weight without external fat was identified only when imprinting was considered in the analysis. The aim of the present study was to investigate QTL on pig chromosome X for traits of carcass characteristics  chemical and physical body composition and accretion rates as well as daily gain  feed intake and food conversion ratio considering the specific features of the sex chromosomes as described in the introduction. There is evidence in the literature for QTL on pig chromosome X involved in carcass characteristics  lean tissue  growth and fatness . [          ]. In particular  the study by Milan . [] reported QTL on SSCX with the largest effects for leanness and fatness traits in a cross between the French Large White and the Meishan breeds. In the present study  QTL were identified on SSCX for carcass characteristics (entire carcass cuts and lean tissue)  chemical body composition  lipid accretion as well as feed intake. The QTL analysis is based on animals from an F full-sib design of crosses between Pietrain boars and crossbred commercial dams in order to reflect the commercial product of growing-finishing pigs. Therefore  the QTL alleles in the dam founder may not be fixed  which has to be considered in the interpretation of the results. In pigs  the pseudoautosomal region lies at the telomeric end of the p arm of SSCX and covers a ~11 cM region homologous to the Y chromosome. In the present study  this region showed important associations with entire loin weight and lean meat of the loin cut (Figure  and Figure ). The purebred Pietrain breed is associated with higher loin weight (284 g) and lean meat weight of the loin cut (185 g). Within the pseudoautosomal region of SSCX  QTL for entire carcass cuts and lean tissue have also been reported in the literature [    ]. A previous genomic analysis on the autosomes using the same phenotypic data as the present study [  ]  detected Pietrain alleles for QTL on SSC2  SSC6  SSC8  SSC9 and SSC13 also associated with increased weights of carcass cuts and lean tissue. However  this was not the case on SSC14 on which a Pietrain allele was associated with decreased weights of these characteristics  suggesting a cryptic gene in a breed selected over a long period for leanness. Although pseudoautosomal regions exist in other mammals  their length and gene content seem to be variable  for example mouse and human pseudoautosomal regions are totally non-homologous. Previously  this region was considered to have an important role in meiotic pairing and male fertility. However the variability in gene content of this region across species and the absence of this region in marsupials  suggest that it may not be so important for fertility in mammals []. The results of the present study indicate that this region in pigs contains genes  which influence carcass characteristics. QTL for lean tissue characteristics . [    ] have been detected in regions other than the pseudoautosomal region of SSCX. In the present study no QTL for lean tissue was identified  which suggests that the favorable alleles for lean tissue may already be fixed in the populations analyzed here. Another surprising result is that no QTL for fatness was identified although many reports have described fatness QTL on pig SSCX . [        ]. Most of these studies were based on crosses between breeds characterized by a high leanness and breeds characterized by a high fatness . Meishan  wild Boar or Iberian breeds. Therefore  these QTL may not be segregating in our population  which has been selected for leanness over a long time. It is likely that the genomic regulation of chemical body components and their accretion is a complex process involving more than one genomic region and regulated differently throughout growth. Measurements of chemical body composition in live animals are expensive. Therefore  studies on QTL associated with these traits are limited to two studies analyzing the data of the present population across several autosomes [  ]. In the present study  we have identified a significant QTL for lipid accretion rate at 90–120 kg on SSCX  while a previous report by Duthie . [] detected QTL for the same trait on two autosomes at 60–90 kg on SSC8 and at 120–140 kg on SSC9. Pietrain alleles were found to be associated with increased lipid accretion rate at 60–90 kg on SSC8 and 90–120 kg on SSCX. A significant dominance effect was identified at the QTL for lipid accretion rate 120–140 kg on SSC9  however no dominance effect was identified on SSCX. The QTL for lipid accretion rate identified on SSCX is in a region containing no QTL for fat tissue  unlike the QTL detected on SSC8 and 9  which were close to numerous QTL for subcutaneous fat (SSC9) and a QTL for intramuscular fat (SSC8) []. This result is surprising because many QTL for fat tissue traits have been reported around this SSCX region [    ]. In the same location as the SSCX QTL associated with lipid accretion rate  a QTL for jowl weight was found (Figure ). Heterozygous animals had a higher weight of the jowl cut. A previous analysis of the same phenotypic data also revealed a QTL for jowl weight on SSC1 [] but heterozygous animals at this QTL had a lower jowl weight. Furthermore  a significant additive effect indicated that Pietrain alleles were associated with lower jowl weight on SSC1. To our knowledge  there is no other data in the literature for such QTL. Suggestive QTL were identified in the present study for chemical body composition at an early growth stage (30 kg body weight)  in a region of SSCX where no other QTL were identified (Figure ). Previously  QTL for chemical body composition for early growth stages have also been identified on autosomes: 30 kg  SSC6  60 kg  SSC6 and SSC9 [  ]. At the QTL on SSC6 and SSC9 for chemical body composition at 30 kg and 60 kg  respectively  significant dominance effects indicate that heterozygous animals are associated with decreased protein content of the fat-free substance and lipid content of the empty body  but increased protein content of the empty body. In contrast  at the QTL on SSCX and SSC6 for chemical body composition at 30 kg and 60 kg respectively  significant dominance effects indicate that heterozygous animals are associated with increased protein content of the fat-free substance and lipid content of the empty body  and decreased protein content of the empty body. The QTL likelihood ratio profile for protein content of the empty body is almost identical to the QTL for lipid content of the empty body  which is expected for traits that change proportionally in opposite directions. A large number of QTL have been reported for lean and fat tissue as well as for growth . [      ] in the same SSCX region as that containing QTL for chemical body composition. Therefore it is surprising that no QTL were identified in this study for physical body composition traits in this region of SSCX. Cepica . [] have assigned seven genes between markers  and   within the same region as the QTL for chemical body composition identified in the present study. Based on location and function   gene () is a potential positional candidate gene for the QTL for chemical body composition in the present study because it plays a key role in the metabolism of fatty acids and thus energy balance []. A suggestive QTL for daily feed intake for the growth stage 120–140 kg was identified in a region of SSCX where no other QTL were identified in the present study (Figure ). Our previous analysis with the same population data on several autosomes  identified significant QTL for daily feed intake for growth periods 60–90 kg on SSC6 and SSC10  90–120 kg on SSC6 and 120–140 kg on SSC2 [  ]. Pietrain alleles were associated with decreased feed intake at 60–90 kg (SSC10)  as expected for a breed  which has been intensively selected for lean content [  ]. However  the Pietrain alleles (cryptic) at the SSCX QTL are associated with a 102 g higher feed intake at 120–140 kg. This is unexpected  as the Pietrain breed is well known for its low feed intake capacity. Within the same marker bracket ()  Cepica . [] have reported a QTL for food consumption in a population derived from a cross between wild Boar and Meishan. Imprinting can be analyzed only in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome  where X and Y chromosomes are homologous. Imprinting analysis is important to achieve a better understanding of the genetic control of important traits and to uncover QTL  which cannot be detected from an analysis considering only additive and dominance effects. In the present study  the QTL for entire loin weight showed paternal imprinting indicating that only the maternal allele is expressed at this QTL. Moreover  a QTL for neck weight without external fat was identified  which was not detected in the analysis without imprinting modelling. At this QTL  maternal imprinting was identified indicating that only the paternal allele is expressed. To the best of our knowledge  there is no information in the literature  reporting imprinting within the pseudoautosomal region of SSCX. The literature is sparse for QTL on chromosome X in other livestock species. In cattle and sheep  no QTL have been reported for similar traits on the X chromosome. In cattle  only four QTL have been reported on the X chromosome for reproduction and disease resistance traits [  ] and in sheep a single QTL has been reported for parasite resistance []. There is limited evidence for QTL affecting production traits in these species and more effort is needed to detect such QTL. Unlike in mammals  in chickens sex determination operates through a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system in which females represent the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males the homogametic sex (ZZ) []. A large number of QTL for production traits have been identified on the Z sex chromosome . [–]. The results of the present study indicate that pig chromosome X is involved in the genomic regulation of physical and chemical body composition as well as growth and feed intake. Our previous analysis of the same data set over several autosomes [  ] detected a larger number of significant QTL  indicating that the role of SSCX is probably less important in the regulation of economically important traits in pig production than that of autosomes. However  the QTL found on SSCX did account for similar proportions of the phenotypic variance. In summary  the present results on sex-linked QTL in pigs give more insight into the sex related genomic regulation of these traits  which may be based on different features from those on autosomal chromosomes.

This may result in bias and larger standard errors of the estimated parameters and  as a consequence  reduce the benefits of applying marker-assisted selection. Our study examines the impact of the following factors: phenotypic information  depth of pedigree  and missing genotypes in the application of marker-assisted selection. Stochastic simulations were conducted to generate a typical dairy cattle population. Genetic parameters and breeding values were estimated using a two-step approach. First  pre-corrected phenotypes (daughter yield deviations (DYD) for bulls  yield deviations (YD) for cows) were calculated in polygenic animal models for the entire population. These estimated phenotypes were then used in marker assisted BLUP (MA-BLUP) evaluations where only the genotyped animals and their close relatives were included.Models using YD of cows (bull dams) in addition to DYD of bulls resulted in much smaller standard errors for the estimated variance components. The bias in DYD models was larger than in models including YD. Depth of pedigree had the strongest impact on the standard errors of all the estimated variance components.

This may result in bias and larger standard errors of the estimated parameters and  as a consequence  reduce the benefits of applying marker-assisted selection. Our study examines the impact of the following factors: phenotypic information  depth of pedigree  and missing genotypes in the application of marker-assisted selection. Stochastic simulations were conducted to generate a typical dairy cattle population. Genetic parameters and breeding values were estimated using a two-step approach. First  pre-corrected phenotypes (daughter yield deviations (DYD) for bulls  yield deviations (YD) for cows) were calculated in polygenic animal models for the entire population. These estimated phenotypes were then used in marker assisted BLUP (MA-BLUP) evaluations where only the genotyped animals and their close relatives were included. Models using YD of cows (bull dams) in addition to DYD of bulls resulted in much smaller standard errors for the estimated variance components. The bias in DYD models was larger than in models including YD. Depth of pedigree had the strongest impact on the standard errors of all the estimated variance components. As expected  estimation of variance components was less precise with larger proportions of animals without genotypes in the pedigree. Accuracies of MA-BLUP breeding values for young bull candidates were strongly affected by the inclusion of cow information  but only marginally influenced by pedigree depth and proportions of genotyped animals. Advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of several genes and of genetic markers linked or associated with genes that affect traits of interest in livestock (QTL). Once QTL are detected  the aim of animal breeders is to integrate linked markers for QTL into the breeding program  in so-called marker assisted selection schemes (MAS). An overview about different possibilities to apply marker- and gene-assisted selection is given by Dekkers []. While the highest benefits are expected from gene-assisted selection using direct markers []  in many cases  practical applications of MAS have to rely on anonymous markers that are often assumed to be in population-wide linkage equilibrium with the QTL. The statistical model for using marker information in BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) (MA-BLUP) genetic evaluations was developed by Fernando and Grossman []. The MA-BLUP methodology allows the simultaneous estimation of QTL and polygenic effects. The QTL effect is accounted for in the mixed model as an extra random effect with the covariance structure proportional to the IBD (identity by descent) matrix at the QTL position given the linked markers []. Components of an integrated system to apply MAS for routine evaluations are given by Dekkers []. In nearly all implementations  it will be necessary to take three decisions: i) how many animals are to be included in the MA-BLUP model  ii) which phenotypes should be used  and iii) how much effort is justified in order to completely genotype ancestors of the current young bull generation. The aim of our study is to examine these three questions with respect to bias and standard errors of estimated variance components and accuracies of MA-BLUP breeding values by means of simulation. A stochastic simulation model was applied to generate a data set that was then analyzed with five different models. Each simulation cycle consisted of two phases: data generation and analysis of the simulated data sets. The number of replicates for each variant was 100. In the simulation  data was generated for a conventional dairy cattle breeding scheme on a small scale. The general procedure is described in detail by Neuner . []. Parameters of the simulated population and base parameters of the progeny-testing program are shown in Table . The time horizon for data generation was 34 years in the current study. A single-trait model for 305-day milk yield with a heritability of 0.36 and an additive genetic variance of 260 100 kg was chosen. Genetic parameters were in agreement with the actual first lactation parameters of German Fleckvieh []. The overall breeding value of each animal was the sum of a 'residual polygenic breeding value' and a 'QTL breeding value'. A single biallelic QTL with an allele frequency of 0.5 was assumed and the QTL was bracketed by two marker loci located 3 cM and 2 cM apart  each with 10 alleles but different allelic distributions. Allele frequencies for the marker 3 cM apart from the QTL were 40  19  15  12  7  2  2  1  1 and 1% (polymorphic information content  PIC = 0.732)  and for the marker 2 cM apart were 60  20  8  4  2  2  1  1  1 and 1% (PIC = 0.555)  respectively. The Haldane mapping function [] was assumed to simulate meiosis. The multipoint polymorphism content [] for the simulated QTL position was 0.753. All calculations assumed a QTL accounting for 20% of the overall additive genetic variance of the trait investigated  without dominance effects at the QTL. In routine genetic evaluations of dairy cattle all pedigreed animals are included. However  when applying MAS  only a small fraction of animals might be genotyped at genetic markers. Since only the genotyped animals provide information for the estimation of QTL variance components and breeding values in MA-BLUP models  the 'two-step approach' as described by Liu . []  Druet . [] and Bennewitz . [] was used in this study. In the first step  a classical polygenic animal model (AM) evaluation  assuming the true variance components are known  was conducted for the entire population in order to estimate daughter yield deviations (DYD) for bulls and yield deviations (YD) for cows  respectively []. The pedigree contained about 260 000 animals of which 251 000 were cows with phenotypic records. To estimate AM-based breeding values  DYD  and YD  the package MiX99 [] was used. The second evaluation step was applied only to a subset of genotyped animals from the population (MA-BLUP pedigree). Usually the pedigree used for MA-BLUP evaluations contains only young bull candidates  young bulls currently used  waiting bulls and their parents and one or more generations of ancestors. For the current study it was assumed that complete marker information was theoretically available for all animals in the MA-BLUP pedigree. Phenotypic observations in step 2 were either DYD of bulls alone  or DYD together with YD of cows. The different amount of information available for DYD was accounted for by applying weighting factors to DYD. YD were not weighted  because each cow had only one record in the current study (Druet 2006; personal communication) and fixed effects that may have an impact on the accuracy of the estimation of YD  . herd effects  were not assumed. When using DYD and YD together in one model for MA-BLUP evaluations  it is necessary to consider that these two information types represent different amounts of genetic and residual variance. Neuner . [] have provided a detailed description of this issue. In order to account for these differences weighting of information was necessary. The weighting factors EDC (effective daughter contributions  Fikse and Banos []) and  [] were applied to twice the DYD in DYD-YD evaluations. An MA-BLUP model equivalent to that of Fernando and Grossman [] was used for the estimation of MA-BLUP breeding values: =  + + +  (1) where is the record (YD for dams and twice the DYD for sires) of individual   is the residual polygenic effect of individual   is the effect of QTL-genotype of individual  and is the residual. QTL effects were included in the evaluations in terms of the IBD (identical by descent) matrix. In contrast to Fernando and Grossman []  IBD matrices applied to (1) are genotypic relationship matrices at the QTL and not gametic relationship matrices. According to (1) the total estimated breeding value (EBV) in MA-BLUP models is the sum of the estimates of the polygenic and the QTL effect obtained by solving the mixed model equations: Based on the complete pedigree used for AM evaluations in step 1  two pedigrees were derived for MA-BLUP. The difference between them was the depth of the pedigree. The 'short pedigree' includes actual selection candidates for progeny testing and young bulls progeny tested during the last four years. In addition  all their parents and grandparents were included. Animals in the deep pedigree were actual selection candidates for progeny testing and bulls tested during the last eight years as well as parents and grandparents of all these bulls. In total  the short pedigree spanned three generations and contained 1 821 animals  whereas the deep pedigree comprised four generations with 2 671 animals. The main characteristics for these two pedigrees are given in Table . Table  is based on the observed numbers of animals during the simulation process. For random QTL models according to Fernando and Grossman [] an IBD matrix reflects the covariance structure of QTL gametic effects in the pedigree. George . [] have reported an extensive overview on algorithms to calculate IBD matrices even for complex pedigrees and incomplete marker information. They concluded that simulation-based algorithms like the multiple-site segregation sampler LOKI [] are efficient tools to calculate IBD matrices for complex pedigree structures. To analyze the effect of missing genotypes  three IBD matrices were calculated for each simulated data set and pedigree size. The first IBD matrix was calculated for the situation where all animals in the MA-BLUP pedigree were genotyped at all markers. Another two IBD matrices were built up for two different genotyping structures: moderate and extensive gaps. To generate the data sets with missing genotypes  realistic constraints were introduced. Old animals at the top of the pedigree are more often not genotyped than animals at the bottom of the pedigree  and missing genotypes occur more often for females than for males. Hence  missing genotypes were generated dependent on the position of an animal in the pedigree and its sex. Simulated proportions of missing genotypes for the two scenarios of incomplete genotyping are given in Table . Scenario 1 could be regarded as a situation that occurs at the start of MA-BLUP in realistic breeding programs. Genotypes are available for most bulls  but most of the older females in the pedigree are not genotyped. Scenario 2 is an extreme situation  with only very sparse genotypic information for the ancestors of current young bull candidates and progeny tested bulls of the last four (eight) years. Missing genotypes in scenario 2 depend on the missing genotypes in scenario 1  . all animals having missing genotypes in scenario 1 have missing genotypes in scenario 2 as well. In total  the proportion of missing genotypes is about 41% for scenario 1 and 61% for scenario 2 for both pedigree depths. All IBD matrices applied for MA-BLUP evaluations were genotypic relationship matrices for the QTL and calculated using the package LOKI []. Genetic parameters for MA-BLUP models and MA-BLUP EBV were estimated with the ASREML package [] using a MA-BLUP model equivalent to that of Fernando and Grossman [] and assuming the QTL position is known from the mapping experiment. Overall  we have examined twelve different models for MA-BLUP evaluations (two information types  two pedigree depths and three degrees of genotyping gaps). In order to limit the amount of variants presented in the paper  we decided to use a stepwise presentation. First  we will compare the DYD model and the DYD-YD model only in the case of complete information and short pedigree. Second  we will proceed with the comparison of short and deep pedigree for the DYD-YD model only and finally we will discuss the effects of missing genotypes in the context of the DYD-YD model with a deep pedigree. The variants are summarized in the first three columns of Table . Parameters considered for the estimation of variance components were the bias of estimated variance components and their standard errors. The estimates deviation from the simulated parameters was used to check for bias due to the pedigree depth and/or missing genotypes. Standard errors of the estimates were used to assess the precision of estimates between different models. In order to assess the fit of the genetic model  the likelihood ratio test ( = -2 ln(()-()) was calculated.  and  represent the likelihood values at the REML solutions of evaluations where no QTL was assumed to be segregating ()  and where a QTL was assumed to be segregating ()  respectively. To examine the impact of the different models on the estimation of MA-BLUP breeding values  the correlation of true and estimated breeding values was calculated for each group of animals (bulls  cows  young bull candidates). Results presented are the averages of 100 replicates for a 20% simulated proportion of genetic variance explained by the QTL. Even if QTL variances close to zero were estimated in single replicates as an effect of a weak data structure  especially in DYD models for short pedigrees  these estimates were not excluded from the analysis in all investigated situations. This was necessary  as it was our interest  to elaborate and characterize the range of estimated parameters when a QTL is known to segregate with a fixed variance. In contrast  studies that aim at a possible gain due to MAS [] allow for the exclusion of replicates that will not give benefits for the breeding program  because structure of the data and relevant parameters indicate that MAS will not improve selection. Results for the estimation of variance components for the investigated combinations of phenotypic information  pedigree depth and missing genotypes are summarized in Table . The first two lines of table  concern the question: which amount of phenotypic information should be used? In DYD models  the additive genetic variance () was underestimated while the genetic variance explained by the QTL () and the ratio of  and  were overestimated. The estimates in DYD-YD models were closer to the simulated parameters. The standard errors of the estimated variance components were lower in DYD-YD models. Figure  visualizes the variation of the estimated genetic variances in DYD and DYD-YD models. The amplitude in DYD-YD models is smaller for both  and . The benefit of using YD in addition to DYD is also confirmed by the higher LRT of the DYD-YD model (see Figure ). . Figure 1a presents results for MA-BLUP models using only daughter yield deviations (DYD) of bulls as phenotypic information  whereas Figure 1b shows the results for MA-BLUP evaluations using DYD of bulls and yield deviations (YD) of cows together. The effect of increasing the depth of the pedigree is summarized in the second and third lines of Table . The values of the estimated components are nearly the same whether the short or deep pedigree is applied  but standard errors indicate an increased accuracy for the estimates in the deep pedigree. The graphs in Figure  visualize the estimated standard errors. Increasing the pedigree depth reduces notably the variation between the replicates  which can also be seen from the higher LRT. . Phenotypic information corresponds to daughter yield deviations (DYD) of bulls and yield deviations (YD) of cows; Figure 2a presents results for MA-BLUP models with a short depth of pedigrees (see text for details)  whereas in Figure 2b deep pedigrees were used for MA-BLUP evaluations. Results for the impact of missing genotypes are shown in lines three to five of Table . Missing genotypes do not lead to biased estimates for variance components. However  they increase the standard error for  whereas the standard errors for all other variance components are hardly affected (see Figure ). To evaluate the consequences of the varying conditions for the estimation of MA-BLUP breeding values  accuracies were calculated for proven bulls  cows and young bull candidates. Correlations between simulated and estimated breeding values were assessed for the overall MA-BLUP EBV (2)  the residual polygenic breeding value ( in (2))  and the breeding value at the QTL (QTL-EBV   in (2)). The results shown in Table  are again averages of 100 replicates. Accuracies in AM evaluations were 0.950 for proven bulls  0.760 for cows and 0.560 for young bulls. Average MA-BLUP accuracies for all categories of animals are hardly affected by the model  pedigree depth or missing genotypes  but strongly affected by the inclusion of YD. The increase in pedigree depth causes a slight improvement of accuracy for young bulls  because the gametic effects can be estimated more accurately. However  this slight increase is gradually lost as the amount of missing genotypes increases. Questions examined in this study came up during the implementation of MAS for Simmental cattle in Germany and Austria. Our main interest was to find out how to set up an appropriate MA-BLUP system given that it was already decided to use MAS  and in view of the fact that not all relevant animals can be genotyped. In this study  we have investigated the impact of three factors on the estimation of variance components for marker-assisted selection under realistic assumptions: phenotypic information  depth of the pedigree and missing genotypes. Early studies about properties of MAS are in most cases based on nucleus breeding programs [  ]  but this assumption does not hold for the majority of cattle breeding programs in Europe. Therefore  in this study  MAS was integrated in an existing breeding program using a two-step approach as is the case for practical applications in France and Germany [  ]. Genetic parameters  information content of genetic markers and variance explained by the QTL in the simulation were in agreement with recent results found in German Simmental cattle (unpublished data). Allele frequencies of 0.5 for alternative QTL alleles were assumed to reduce the risk of loosing alternative alleles due to random drift along the simulation process. As mentioned by Rönnegård and Carlborg [] simulations have shown that random QTL models are capable of giving unbiased estimates even when the QTL is biallelic. Furthermore  the assumptions of a biallelic QTL and balanced allele frequencies reflect findings for QTL in cattle. A well-known example for a biallelic QTL is the K232A substitution in DGAT1. Estimated allele frequencies for alleles at K232A were 0.548 and 0.452 in German Holsteins []. Another biallelic QTL is reported for the bovine prolactin receptor in Finnish Ayrshire [] with allele frequencies of 0.45/0.55 for snp 6. Guillaume . [] have reported the proportions of genetic variance explained by single QTL used for the French MAS-program  which range from 5 to 40% for individual QTL. Hence  a QTL explaining 20% of the genetic variance in this study is in the scope of findings for MAS programs in reality. In contrast to practical applications of MAS using multiple QTL [  ] this study was restricted to a single QTL. Our intention was to examine the influence of different structures of information (pedigree depth  completeness of genotyping) on the estimation of QTL effects. We did not want to examine the effect of several QTL on the accuracy of genetic parameters or on the benefits of MAS. We think that our conclusions will also hold for situations with more QTL  because  in practice  we observe that animals are either genotyped for all QTL or not genotyped at all. According to our results  the choice of phenotypic information in MA-BLUP models is important. We have shown (Neuner .  []) that the two-step approach intrinsically causes a loss of information because not all relatives contribute to the MA-BLUP breeding value. In consequence  some proportion of the QTL information is required to compensate this loss of information. The inclusion of yield deviations for dams reduces this loss of information. As we have shown here  yield deviations also improve the precision for the estimated variance components and deviations from the simulated parameters become smaller. Neuner . [] have already discussed the topic concerning the 'choice of weighting factors in MA-BLUP models'. According to the results  the weighting factors daughter equivalents and effective daughter contributions do not introduce bias. One challenge is to combine correctly DYD and YD in one model as these two types of information contain different amounts of genetic and residual variance []. The advantage of a more extensive pedigree of genotyped animals for MA-BLUP is obvious. The more animals have complete information  the smaller is the observed standard error of the estimated parameters. Similar to the effect of having more offspring for progeny tested bulls  a deeper pedigree implies more data and more informative matings for the estimation of QTL effects of parents and grandparents in MA-BLUP models. Our results show that using a deep pedigree with many gaps is still preferable over a short but complete pedigree. The reason for this is that a deeper pedigree improves the estimation of polygenic and residual variances as compared to shorter pedigrees. The effect of a more parsimonious pedigree has also been shown by George . []. By altering the number of offspring per mating from 1.8 to 14.3 offspring per mating  the number of progeny per parent providing information to estimate genetic parameters and MA-BLUP EBV was higher. Even if the approach of George . [] was different from the one in our study  similar effects of a larger pedigree were observed: more accurate estimates and increased power. The third factor investigated was the effect of missing genotypes in MA-BLUP evaluations. If marker information was complete and could be used to infer the transmission of QTL alleles  then the IBD matrix would only contain 1s and 0s. At the other extreme  if no marker information was available  the IBD matrix would become identical to the numerator relationship matrix  . all covariance elements with the parents will be equal to 0.5  signifying equal probability of inheriting either allele from a parent. In the end  this would result in identical estimators for residual polygenic and QTL variance. Several approaches exist to deal with the problem that non-genotyped animals do not contribute information for QTL models []. A well-known approach is the multiple-site segregation sampler LOKI [] that was used in this study. We found that missing genotypes did not lead to biased variance components. In contrast to our results  George . [] have reported that  if more genotypes are missing  the QTL variance is overestimated  the residual polygenic variance is underestimated and bias is increased. The main reason for these contradictory results could be that the structure of pedigree and missing data in our study allowed a much better reconstruction of missing genotypes by LOKI. In the sheep pedigree of George . [] the number of male progeny and grand progeny was smaller than that in the cattle breeding program of this research. Thus  less descendants are available to contribute information for the reconstruction of their ancestors' genotypes. Furthermore  the amount of phenotypic information per sire is very different in both studies. Compared to George . []  both the better ability to reconstruct missing genotypes and the higher amount of phenotypic information for MA-BLUP result in unbiased estimates in our study. A QTL explaining 20% of the additive genetic variance was intentionally chosen  because such a QTL is in the order of magnitude that we observed in Simmental cattle and because it shows nicely that MA-BLUP is not necessarily more accurate than conventional BLUP. Our results show that the accuracy of MA-BLUP breeding values is little affected by the pedigree depth and hardly affected by missing genotypes. However  it is strongly affected by the inclusion of YD in the MA-BLUP system []. Guillaume . [] have reported empirical results for the accuracies of EBV for young bulls in the French MAS program. The results of our study are in line with their findings for milk yield. When 40% of the genetic variance were marked with four QTL  they found an increase in accuracy for EBV of young bulls in MA-BLUP models of 0.030 compared to the AM model. In our study  we observed accuracies that were 0.006 higher for one QTL explaining 20% of the genetic variance. The main reason for this small increase was the loss of information due to the two-step approach. As mentioned by Neuner . [] the loss has to be compensated before additional gain can arise. With respect to accuracy of EBV in MA-BLUP models  Villanueva . [] have investigated the benefit of increased pedigree and marker information. They simulated four additional generations of random selection in order to extend their data set. The increased amount of marker genotype information significantly increased the accuracy of the estimation of the QTL effects from 0.54 to 0.65. Parameters in their study were 0.25 for the heritability and 0.24 for the ratio of genetic variance explained by the QTL. Spelman [] also concluded that if more animals are genotyped in each generation and if more generations of genotypic information are used for MAS  an increase in accuracy of the estimation of QTL effects and therefore in MAS superiority are obtained. At present many research programs are conducted in order to implement genomic breeding value estimations as described by Meuwissen . []. Although first implementations exist [] it is not sure that MAS schemes will be abandoned. Improvements in existing MAS programs will directly improve the selection until genomic selection will be applied. We also expect that QTL mapping based on the variance component approach [] will continue in the future. Our results can be helpful in optimizing the choice of individuals to be genotyped. In genomic selection projects  which animals to genotype and which source of phenotypic information to use will also have to be decided. Comparable to our study  we expect it will be necessary to rank animals selected for genotyping by their importance in the pedigree and their impact on further generations. For the phenotypic information  applied appropriate weighting and combination of DYD and YD will also be necessary for a correct modeling of genetic and residual variances. As soon as dams will be genotyped for genomic selection  considering their genotypes and YD for parameter estimation will help to improve the accuracy of estimated QTL effects in the same way as in our current study. The main conclusion of this study is that phenotypic information of cows and an increased depth of the pedigree have an important impact on the precision of genetic parameters estimated in MA-BLUP models. Furthermore  deep pedigrees with many missing genotypes provide more accurate estimates than short pedigrees with complete genotyping. While the estimation of variance components is considerably improved by a deep pedigree with no missing genotypes  the accuracy of MA-BLUP genetic evaluation is hardly affected by these factors. As a consequence  if exact QTL parameters are available from other sources  the same accuracy of MA-BLUP can also be achieved with a short pedigree and many missing genotypes.

Using an animal model and including the direct inverse of a numerator relationship matrix (NRM) into a mixed model has made these analyses possible. However  a method including a genetically identical animal (GIA) in NRM if genetic relationships between pairs of GIAs are not perfect  is still lacking. Here  we describe a method to incorporate GIAs into NRM using a  matrix in which diagonal elements are set to 1.0  off-diagonal elements between pairs of GIAs to (1-x) and the other elements to 0  where x is a constant less than 0.05. The inverse of the  matrix is then calculated directly by a simple formula. Thus  the inverse of the NRM is calculated by the products of the lower triangular matrix that identifies the parents of each individual  its transpose matrix  the inverse of the  matrix and the inverse of diagonal matrix   in which the diagonal elements comprise a number of known parents and their inbreeding coefficients. The computing method is adaptable to the analysis of a data set including pairs of GIAs with imperfect relationships. Cloning animals is regarded as a means to multiply genetically identical animals (GIAs). In Japan  clones of bulls are routinely produced to test bulls' performance and in some cases to multiply fattening animals. A survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture  Forestry and Fisheries  and published on October 31  2007  has recorded calves cloned from somatic cells of 535 animals and from embryonic cell nuclei of 716 animals. In animal breeding  analysis of quantitative traits using a mixed model is essential to predict the breeding value of an individual and to estimate the genetic parameters of the traits. When applying an animal model to perform the genetic analysis  it is necessary to include the inverse of the numerator relationship matrix (NRM) in order to connect all the animals included in the mixed model; however  calculating the inverse of a large NRM requires exceptionally large computing power. On the one hand  Henderson [] has developed a method of calculating directly   without calculating the  matrix itself in a non-inbred population. This innovation has made it possible to use a model in which the data set includes a large number of animals. On the other hand  Quaas [] has extended the method for the application to inbred populations by including the inbreeding coefficients in the model. A faster computing method of inbreeding coefficients has been developed by Tier [] and Meuwissen and Luo []  where inbreeding coefficients are computed as a subset of the  matrix. In addidion  Famula [] has proposed a simplified algorithm for inbred populations  incorporating parental uncertainty to the model. Inclusion of GIAs in the model raises the problem of a singular  matrix because of perfect additive genetic relationships between pairs of GIAs. In the case of an analysis with a singular   Henderson [] presented a method to solve a mixed model without inversion of the  matrix  where  = . A few years later  Kennedy and Schaeffer [] proposed a model in which records on GIAs are treated as repeated records on the same genotype. Their model assumes perfect genetic relationships among GIAs. However in reality  the genetic relationship between pairs of GIAs is not perfect because genetic diversity between such pairs originates from several genetic factors such as the difference in the recipient cytoplasm  mutations in the somatic cell and gene imprinting in the nucleus of the somatic cell [–]. Recently a study on human monozygotic twins analysing copy number variation  has revealed that genetic and phenotypic diversities exist even in monozygotic twins within pairs []. The objective of this study was to develop a method to compute directly the inverse of the NRM that includes GIAs with imperfect additive genetic relationships within pairs of GIAs. The  matrix is decomposed according to Famula []. where  is the identity matrix   is a lower triangular matrix which identifies the parents of each individual in the population. The  matrix is a diagonal matrix with    th diagonal element of . Then where and are the inbreeding coefficients of the parents of the  th animal. In (1)   is the lower triangular matrix  and  is its transpose matrix. From(1)  the inverse of the  matrix is as follows: Next  we introduce the  matrix into (1) so that the  matrix includes GIA. Then   is and where  is the matrix where a diagonal element is set to 1 and the off-diagonal element is set to (1 - ) when  th and  th animals are genetically identical and  is a constant near 0;  is as follows: Generally  for a matrix with GIAs where the diagonal elements are set to 1  and the off-diagonal elements are (1 - )  the inverse matrix for n GIAs is where    and . Thus   is calculated  and the diagonal element of  is . Therefore   is calculated directly by the product of the matrices without computing the inverse of . Provided is calculated by the methods of Quaas [] and Famula []   is calculated directly by the following steps: i) If both parents of   say  and  are known     and when  has no GIA        add  to element (  )        add  to elements (  )  (  )  (  ) and (  )        add  to elements (  )  (  )  (  ) and (  );    when  has n GIAs (  j = 1  2  ... n)           add  to element (  )        add  to elements (  )  (  )  (  ) and (  )        add  to elements (  )  (  )  (  ) and (  ).       If  is a donor animal of the GIAs           then add  to elements (  ) and (  ). ii) If only one parent  say p  is known     add  to element (  )     add  to elements (  ) and (  )     add  to element (  ). iii) If neither parent is known     add 1 to element(  ). For the simulation study  animal phenotypes were generated assuming that the heritability of a trait was 0.5 and the variance for both additive genetic effect and random residuals was 2500. The number of animals in the base population (G0) was 300 (150 males and 150 females). Their phenotypic values were generated by the infinitesimal model using the random digits generator  ranlib []. The phenotypic value of a descendant animal in the latter two generations (G1 and G2) was formed by an average of the parents  a Mendelian sampling effect and a random residual. The number of animals was 750 (250 males and 500 females) in G1 and 1000 (no sex effect on recorded animals) in G2. The breeding animals in G1 were selected randomly. Records used to estimate variance components comprised only the phenotypic values of animals in G2. The number of GIAs for each mating was two  .  a total of 1000 GIAs (500 GIA pairs). The variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using remlf90 []. The number of replicates for the simulation was 20 for each x value (from 0.01 to 1.0). Let animal  be genetically identical to animal . Unless their descendants at the  th generation are inbred animals with animal  or  as a common ancestor  the  matrix has the effect of adding (1 - ) to the NRM element of the GIA and of adding  to the NRM element of their descendants at the  th generation. Thus  when there is no GIA  the off-diagonal element of animals  and  for the  matrix is   and the off-diagonal element of animals  and descendant at the  th generation of animal  is . If animals  and  have no common descendant   is as follows: Our example uses a simple pedigree  where animals 1  2 and 3 are in the base population. Animals 4 and 5 are the progeny of 1 and 2  and animal 6 is the progeny of 3 and 5. See Figure .                                                      1) When animals 4 and 5 are full sibs  the  matrix  which identifies the parents of the animals  is as follows: The  matrix has elements calculated in (2). Thus  Therefore   in (3) is as follows:  from (4) is 2) When animals 4 and 5 are GIAs  the  matrix is as follows: Then the inverse of the sub-matrix of  is where     and . Therefore   is  in (5) is as follows: Then  in (4) is Here  if  <U+2192> 0   is as expected  Thus  the elements of animals 4 and 5 are those of the GIAs. Figure  presents the results of the estimated genetic variance. Averages of 20 estimates are shown together with their ranges (minimum and maximum). Genetic variances were overestimated at low (1-x) and around the true value at high (1-x) and estimated residual variances were underestimated at low (1-x) and around the true value at high (1-x) (data not shown). . b. Averages and ranges of log likelihood (-2logL) for different (1-x) values with 20 simulated data sets. Figure  shows averages of log likelihood (-2logL) for various (1-x) values together with their ranges when REML estimates were obtained for the variance components. The log likelihood declined at high (1-x): 0.95 or 0.99  indicating the validity of the model with high (1-x). The difference between the models with 0.95 and 0.99 was statistically insignificant by the likelihood ratio test. The  matrix proposed in this study is directly calculated by a simple formula; thus  calculating the inverse of a large matrix can be avoided as in standard methods [    ]. Using NRM with GIAs results in adding more animal records to a dataset for variance component estimation and in calculating genetic evaluation by the mixed model procedure. The simulation study showed that the estimated genetic variance is reasonably accurate with a high (1-x); however  a low (1-x) resulted in overestimation of the genetic variance  which is caused by false genetic relationships between pairs of GIAs. For instance  in the case of (1-x) equal to 0.0  where the GIAs were erroneously treated as full sibs  a large genetic variance and  consequently  a small residual variance were estimated because the variance component within full sibs was far smaller than that expected for full sibs and vice versa for the variance component between full sibs. This simulation study assumed perfect genetic relationships between pairs of GIAs. Then  a (1-x) value higher than 0.95 can result in unbiased estimates of additive genetic variance for the simulated data sets. Therefore  a (1-x) value of 0.95 is adequate for the data set of this simulation; however  the choice of the x value may depend on the size of the data set and the genetic constituents of a population: a higher (1-x) may be adequate for a large data set and/or a data set containing monozygotic twins. In the analysis of real records  a lower (1-x) value is expected because perfect genetic relationships between pairs of GIAs are no longer attainable. The highest genetic relationship is found among monozygotic twins; however  diversity within pairs of twins was found to be larger than expected  according to the human study by Bruder . []. A similar diversity is observed in embryo splitting studies  but manipulating embryos may constitute a potential source of increased diversity. Clones obtained from embryotic cell nuclear transfer may show a higher diversity caused by the recipient cytoplasm []. In the case of clones obtained from somatic cell nuclear transfer  an additional source for genetic diversity can originate from mutations in the somatic cell and gene imprinting in the nucleus of the somatic cell [  ]. Different types of GIAs with various degrees of genetic diversity do exist. Thus  GIAs can be regarded as highly related animals rather than identical animals. Although  (1-x) values can range from 0.0 to 1.0  it is probably nearer to 1.0. To resolve this question  statistical studies such as REML on the estimation of x are needed with a large data set including various types of GIA. The methodology presented here provides an analytical tool to analyse GIAs with an imperfect genetic relationship within pairs of GIAs.

Altogether these results argue for an increase in the frequency of the  C allele or haplotypes containing this allele in the Norwegian Red cattle population by selective breeding. Several studies have reported the existence of QTL affecting milk production traits on bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6) [  ] (summarized at  and ). Two distinct regions on this chromosome affect milk traits (including protein yield  protein percentage  fat yield  fat percentage and milk yield). One QTL affecting protein and fat percentage has been positioned in a narrow region of 420 kb [] and a putative functional polymorphism in the  gene underlying the QTL has been suggested [  ]. The second region on BTA6 associated with milk traits maps to the casein cluster [. [–]]. The casein cluster is composed of four genes; a-  ß-  a- and <U+03BA>-casein (     and   respectively) producing approximately 80 percent of the protein content of cow's milk []. The four casein genes have been mapped in the order  to bovine chromosome 6 (BTA6) at q31-33 by  hybridisation [  ]. Several polymorphisms have been detected in the open reading frame (reviewed by []) and in noncoding regions such as the 5'-flanking region of the casein genes [  ]. The most common genetic variants in western dairy breeds are a-casein B (here denoted ) and C ()  ß-casein A1 ()  A2 () and B ()  and <U+03BA>-casein A ()  B () and E (). In the present study  we have constructed a dense SNP map in the casein region. The map facilitates accurate haplotype construction and was used for comprehensive association studies in Norwegian Red cattle. All animals in the study belonged to the Norwegian Red cattle breed. For the chromosome wide QTL scan  animals were organized in a granddaughter design consisting of 18 elite sire families with a total of 716 sons and 507 000 granddaughters. To fine-map QTL in the casein region  the animal data was expanded to 31 elite sire families with a total of 1112 sons  ranging from 23 to 70 sons for the smallest and largest families  respectively. The total number of daughters in this analysis was approximately 1.9 million  with an average of 1670 daughters per son. The families were chosen based on sufficiently large family sizes and/or availability of trait data. The pedigree of each animal in the study was traced back as far as known. Daughter yield deviations (DYDs) of the sons were used as performance information in the analyses. The DYDs for milk production traits [protein percentage (P%)  protein yield (PY)  milk yield (MY)  fat percentage (F%) and fat yield (FY)] were available from the national genetic evaluation carried out by GENO Breeding and AI Association  and evaluated using a BLUP animal model []. For the initial QTL scan  we used a map consisting of 399 SNPs covering the entire BTA6 []. To fine-map QTL  we constructed a dense marker map consisting of 73 SNPs in and around the casein region on BTA6  covering approximately 750 kb. Fifty-four of the 73 SNPs in the map were detected by PCR resequencing of promoters and exon regions of all four casein genes (     and )  nine SNPs were available from []  whereas ten SNPs were selected from the Bovine Genome Sequencing Project []. Physical distances between markers were determined from one single scaffold  NW_001495211  available from the latest assembly of the bovine genome Btau_4.0 []. The average distance between SNPs was 10 462 bp (ranging from 7 to 302 143 bp). A description of the SNPs  including accession numbers in dbSNP  assays for genotyping on the MassARRAY system (Sequenom  San Diego  USA)  marker allele frequencies and predicted physical distances between markers can be found in Additional file . A combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LDLA) method [] was used to analyze milk production traits based on the information on markers from the 399-marker map described in [] and a dense SNP map (73 markers) constructed for the casein region (see Additional file ). For the midpoint of each marker bracket  the log-likelihood of a model containing the QTL (LogL()) was calculated as well as a model fitting only background genes (LogL(0)) using the ASREML package []. Our test statistic  LogL difference  was then calculated as the difference in log-likelihood between the first and the second model. This LogL difference times 2 is equal to the Likelihood Ratio Test-statistic (LRT) of []. According to Baret and coworkers  the distribution of the LRT under the null hypothesis can be seen as a mixture of two chi square distributions with 0 and 1 degree of freedom (df)  respectively. Significance levels for the LRT are then found from a chi square distribution with 1 df but doubling the probability levels []. Then  to obtain a significance level of 0.0005  the LRT value corresponding to a chi square distribution with 1 df and P = 0.001 is utilized. This LRT value is 10.8  and thus the corresponding LogL difference must be 5.4 or higher to achieve a significance level of 0.0005. DYDs of the sons were used as performance information in the analyses. The model fitted to the performance information for each trait and each SNP was: =  + +  + + where DYD is performance of son i  µ is the overall mean  s is a fixed effect of sire of son i  x is 0 if son i is homozygous 1 1 (. AA); 1 if son i is heterozygous 1 2 (. AT or TA); or 2 if son i is homozygous 2 2 (. TT)  b is the effect of the SNP  a is a polygenic effect of son i  and e is a residual effect. For each single marker  the log-likelihood of a model containing the SNP effect (LogL(H1)) was calculated as well as a model without this SNP effect (LogL(H0)) using the ASREML package []. Our test statistic  LogL difference  was then calculated as the difference in LogL between the first and the second model as described above. A SNP effect was regarded significant if the LogL difference exceeded 5.4. Additionally  multiple SNP association tests were carried out for the most significant markers from the single SNP association test. The tests were implemented by fitting a fixed effect of the SNP in the above-mentioned model and repeating the analyses for the most significant SNPs in turn. Test statistics for the analyses were as described above. An analysis package  CRIHAP  was developed for determining haplotypic phases and imputing missing genotypes for all individuals (Nome and Lien  unpublished). The programs are based on both linkage and linkage disequilibrium information generated by the CRI-MAP 2.4 [] and PHASE version 2.1 [  ] programs. Map information and genotypes for all animals were imported into the Haploview program [] to calculate LD (r) between markers. Haplotype blocks were constructed for the casein loci    and  for which we found highly significant brackets or single SNPs associated with protein yield. A script was made to deduce maternal and paternal haplotypes for all individuals and different haplotype blocks using haplotypic phases from the CRIHAP program package. As for the single SNP analyses  DYDs of the sons were used as performance information in the analyses. The model fitted to the DYDs  for each trait and each haplotype  was =  + +  + + where DYD is the performance of son i  µ is the overall mean  s is a fixed effect of sire of son i  x is a row-vector indicating which haplotypes and how many copies are carried by the son; and b is a column indicating the random effects of the haplotypes; a is a random polygenic effect of son i  and e is a residual effect. The test statistic (LogL difference) was found as previously described for the single SNP association test. Phenotypic standard deviations for protein and milk yield were 36.75 kg and 1137.79 kg  respectively. These deviations were used to scale the haplotype effects into phenotypic standard deviations for each of the traits for a standardised presentation. Results of the initial QTL scan for milk yield  protein yield  protein percentage  fat yield and fat percentage (LDLA analysis using the 399-marker map) are shown in Figure . For details about the markers  see Table S1 in Nilsen . [] or . The analysis reveals highly significant results (LogL difference > 5.4  P < 0.0005) mainly in two different regions. Milk yield  protein yield and especially fat and protein percentages show highly significant results in the region between approximately 25 and 45 Mb. This QTL  previously fine-mapped in Norwegian Red cattle []  is potentially caused by a polymorphism in the  gene [  ]. Additionally  highly significant results were found for milk and protein yields in the casein cluster region at approximately 90 Mb. The results from the initial scan were followed up by LDLA analyses in a high-resolution map constructed for the casein region (73 SNPs) and using an extended number of families. The result of this analysis for protein yield and percentage are shown in Figure  (for details about the markers  see Additional file ). The LogL difference for protein yield was found for the interval between the markers  and  (LogL difference = 19.5)  but several additional significant results appear for numerous marker brackets in  and . No significant result was found for marker brackets in the  gene. The interval between  and  was the only one with significant LogL difference for protein percentage (LogL difference = 5.6).  . []. Points illustrate bracket midpoints; the physical distance is scaled in Mb and the y-axis denotes the LogL differences. . For better readability  the x-axis has been presented as bracket numbers where points illustrate bracket midpoints; the y-axis reflects the LogL differences. Data was also analysed for association between single SNPs and DYDs for protein yield and milk yield. Highly significant results were found for a number of SNPs in  and  for both protein yield (PY) and milk yield (MY) (Figure  and Figure   respectively). SNPs with the highest LogL differences were  and  for both traits (LogL difference = 26.4 for PY and 15.7 for MY for both SNPs)  in addition to  for MY (LogL difference = 15.8). . The x-axis denotes marker number and the y-axis the LogL differences. . The x-axis denotes marker number and the y-axis the LogL differences. In most cases when fitting an effect of the most significant SNPs in a multiple SNP association test it highly reduced LogL differences for the other SNPs in the region. The most striking results were found for SNPs  and . These two SNPs are in complete LD with each other and both removed almost all peaks for other markers in the region. The result for  is presented in Figure . In accordance with the LDLA results no significant association was found between SNPs in the  gene and DYDs for PY.   . The x-axis denotes marker number and the y-axis the LogL differences. The dense SNP map in the casein region made it possible to construct haplotypes within the casein loci. Such an analysis revealed five haplotypes for   seven haplotypes for  and six haplotypes for  (Figure ). LD between pairs of loci varied from complete disequilibrium to almost no disequilibrium  and was much higher between SNPs in  and  than between SNPs in any other gene (Figure ). The extent of LD between SNPs within    and  allowed us to construct an extended haplotype block covering all three genes  creating 12 haplotypes with a population frequency above 0.9% (Additional file ).       . TagSNPs for each haplotype block  identified by pairwise tagging in the Haploview program  are presented by triangles in the figure; more marker information can be found in Additional file .  []. Each diamond contains the level of LD measured by r between the markers specified; darker tones correspond to increasing levels of r; triangles indicate division by loci. LogL differences for the four individual casein loci for PY and MY are shown in Table . As shown in Figure  and Figure   respectively  highly significant results were found in the  and  genes for both PY and MY. Six haplotypes were identified for . Estimation of the effect of haplotypes within loci on PY and MY revealed two haplotypes that tend to be negative (haplotype 2 and 5) and four haplotypes that tend to be positive (haplotypes 1  3  4 and 6) for  (Figure ). For   we detected three haplotypes that are negative for both MY and PY (haplotypes 2  3 and 4) (Figure ). In contrast  both haplotypes 1 and 5 seem to be positive for both MY and PY. In addition  LogL differences for the extended haplotype block covering  were highly significant for both PY and MY (Table ). The effects of the 12 haplotypes created for this block are shown in Figure . Effects of haplotypes for MY and PY were in the same direction for both traits  with four haplotypes tending to be negative (haplotypes 2  3  6 and 7) and eight haplotypes that seem to be positive for both traits.   . Significance levels of haplotype effects are given in Table 1.   . Significance levels of haplotype effects are given in Table 1.      . Only haplotypes with population frequency above 0.9% are shown; the x-axis denotes haplotype number and the y-axis shows haplotype effects given in phenotypic standard deviations of the traits; significance levels of haplotype effects are given in Table 1. Our analysis of a dense SNP map in the casein region using the LDLA methodology revealed a high number of significant marker brackets for protein yield especially in  and  (Figure  and Figure ). The fact that LDLA could not pin point a single marker bracket harbouring the QTL can probably be explained by a high degree of LD between the markers in the region. Analysis of the extent of LD in the region showed high LD in two segments (one segment consisting of    and  and another one consisting of ) (Figure ). The two segments seem to be broken by a possible recombinant hotspot. Nilsen . [] have reported evidence for a recombination hotspot between  and   confirming these findings. Hayes . [] have also reported a recombination hotspot in the casein region in goat. Despite the fact that all four casein genes are coordinately expressed at high levels in a tissue- and stage-specific fashion  the <U+03BA>-casein gene is not evolutionarily related to the three other casein genes (a  ß and a) []. The calcium-sensitive caseins (a  ß and a) have originated from a common ancestral gene via intergenic and intragenic duplications [] and share common regulatory motifs []  whereas it has been suggested that the <U+03BA>-casein is related to fibrinogens on the basis of amino acid sequence similarities []. This evolutionary origin may also account for the LD segmentation described in this paper. In accordance with the LDLA results  the single SNP association tests did not detect significant results for the  region  whereas a large number of significant associations were detected between SNPs within  and   and protein and milk yields. The most significant results were found for    and . When fitting  as fixed effect in a multiple SNP association test it removed almost all peaks for other markers in the region (Figure ). This indicates that  is in strong LD with the underlying causal variation in Norwegian Red. However  the fact that the two SNP alleles seem to display contradictory effects in various cattle breeds [–  ] argue against  as being an underlying causal variation. Notably   determines the genetic variants A1/B versus A2. The C <U+2192> A substitution at codon 67 results in the exchange of proline with histidine in the amino acid sequence []  leading to a difference in the conformation of the secondary structure of the expressed protein. It is thought that the A allele at  yields the bioactive peptide beta-casomorphin 7 ()  a peptide with opioid-like effect  which may play an unclear role in the development of some human diseases (for a review  see []). It has been suggested that a high consumption of A1/B milk increases the risk of type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus []  ischaemic heart disease []  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) []  the aggravation of symptoms associated with schizophrenia and autism (reviewed in [])  and may also correlate with milk allergy [  ] in humans. The high degree of LD between SNPs allowed us to construct haplotypes within and across the  and  genes and investigate associations between haplotypes and DYDs for protein yield and milk yield. Analysis for  reveals two haplotypes (2 and 5) that associate with low protein yield values whereas four haplotypes (1  3  4 and 6) seem to be associated with higher PY levels (Figure ). The difference between these two classes of haplotypes is characterized by the three SNPs    and  (marker 11  14 and 16  respectively; Figure )  all of which have high LogL differences in the single SNP association test for both PY and MY. For the  locus  we detected two haplotypes that seem to be associated with increased protein yield (1 and 5) whereas three haplotypes (2  3 and 4) tend to be associated with a lower protein yield (Figure ).  haplotype 5 is part of  haplotype 5 (see Figure ). No significant haplotype was detected for  (data not shown). The main reason is probably that  haplotypes 1 (positive for protein yield) and 2 (negative for protein yield) combine into one frequent haplotype in . For the extended block covering   we detected four haplotypes that associate with reduced milk and protein production (haplotype 2  3  6 and 7). Interestingly  all of these haplotypes contain the A-allele of  (the A1/B variant)  in addition to the G-allele of  (Additional file ). In contrast  haplotypes containing the  variant tend to associate with increased milk and protein yields. As consumption of CSN-A2 milk may have an accompanying positive effect on human health [            ] it is recommended to increase the frequency of this allele in the Norwegian cattle population. One possible way of implementation would be to preselect calves prior to phenotype testing for growth performance and progeny testing for milk performance.

Alternatively Monte Carlo sampling can be used to calculate approximations of the prediction error variance  which converge to the true values if enough samples are used. However  in practical situations the number of samples  which are computationally feasible  is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the convergence rate of different formulations of the prediction error variance calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Four of these formulations were published  four were corresponding alternative versions  and two were derived as part of this study.

Alternatively Monte Carlo sampling can be used to calculate approximations of the prediction error variance  which converge to the true values if enough samples are used. However  in practical situations the number of samples  which are computationally feasible  is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the convergence rate of different formulations of the prediction error variance calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Four of these formulations were published  four were corresponding alternative versions  and two were derived as part of this study. The different formulations had different convergence rates and these were shown to depend on the number of samples and on the level of prediction error variance. Four formulations were competitive and these made use of information on either the variance of the estimated breeding value and on the variance of the true breeding value minus the estimated breeding value or on the covariance between the true and estimated breeding values. In quantitative genetics the prediction error variance-covariance matrix is central to the calculation of accuracies of estimated breeding values () [ []]  to REML algorithms for the estimation of variance components []  to methods which restrict the variance of response to selection []  and can be used to explore trends in Mendelian sampling deviations over time []. The mixed model equations () for most national genetic evaluations range from 100 000 to 20 000 000 equations and inversion of systems of equations of this size is generally not possible because of their magnitude or because of loss of numerical precision []. Methods that approximate the prediction error variances () and calculate the accuracy of  provide biased estimates in some circumstances by ignoring certain information [ []]. Variance components upon which genetic evaluations of large populations are based are generally estimated using reduced data sets. The use of reduced data sets may create bias in the estimates as REML only provides unbiased estimates of variance components when all the data on which selection has taken place is included in the analysis []. Variance of response to selection is generally not controlled in breeding programs although it might be a risk to them []. Approximations of the PEV without needing to invert the coefficient matrix or to delete data  can be obtained by comparing Monte Carlo samples of the data and successive solutions of the mixed model equations of this data. However different formulations have been presented to approximate the PEV in this way [–]. Approximations of the PEV using these formulations converge to the exact PEV () as the number of Monte Carlo samples increases  but the number of samples is generally limited by computational requirements in practice [ []]. Also  differences in the rates of convergence have been shown to depend on the level of PEV for a given genetic variance () []. Consequently  when finding the optimal number of iterations required  both the different formulations  and the level of PEV need to be taken into account. Some of the formulations are weighted averages of other formulations  with the weighting depending on the sampling variances of these. Garcia-Cortes  [] use asymptotic approximations of these sampling variances. Alternative weighting strategies could use empirically approximated sampling variances based on independent replicates of samples or using leave-one-out Jackknife procedures [  ]. The objective of this study was to compare the convergence to PEV of ten different formulations of the PEV  using simulations based on data and pedigree from a commercial population containing animals with different levels of PEV and using different numbers of samples ( = 50  100  ...  950  1000). Four of the formulations were previously published  four were alternative versions of these  and two were derived as part of this study. The Monte Carlo sampling procedure for calculating the sampled PEV has been described extensively elsewhere for single breed [–] and multiple breed scenarios []. Assuming a simple additive genetic animal model without genetic groups  =  +  +   where the distribution of random variables is  ~ (  ' + )   ~ (  )  and  ~ (  )  the three steps involved in calculating the sampled PEV are as follows:  Simulate  samples of  and  using the pedigree and the distributions of the original data  modified to account for the fact that the expectation of  does not affect the distribution of random variables [  ] thus the samples of  can be simulated using random normal deviates from (  ' + ) instead of (  ' + ).  Set up and solve the mixed model equations for the data set using the  simulated samples of  instead of the true . This accounts for the fixed effects structure of the real data.  Calculate the sampled PEV for some formulation. Ten formulations of the sampled PEV are shown in Table . The first three formulations (PEV  PEV  and PEV) were outlined by Garcia-Cortes  [] and the fourth formulation (PEV) was outlined by Fouilloux and Laloë []. PEV  PEV  PEV  and PEV are alternative versions of these formulations  which rescale the formulations from the Var (u) and to the  in order to account for the effects of sampling on the Var(u). Two new formulations of the sampled PEV (PEV  and PEV) are also given in Table . The ten formulations differ from each other in the way in which they compare information relating to the Var(u)  the Var()  the Var (u - )  or the Cov(u  ). Formulae  based on Taylor series approximations  to predict the asymptotic sampling variances for each of the ten formulations of sampled PEV at different levels of PEV are given in Table . The sampling variance can also be approximated stochastically using a number ( 100) of independent replicates of the  samples or by applying a leave-one-out Jackknife [  ] to the  samples. A data set containing 32 128 purebred Limousin animals with records for a trait (height) and a corresponding pedigree of 50 435 animals was extracted from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation database. In the simulations the trait was assumed to have a  of 1.0 and residual variance  of 3.0. Fixed effects were contemporary group  technician who scored the animal  parity of dam  age of animal at scoring and sex. The PEV were calculated for the extracted data set by setting up and solving the MME  with fixed effects of contemporary group  technician who scored the animal  parity of dam  and a second order polynomial of age of animal at scoring nested within sex  and random animal and residual effects  using the BLUP option in ASReml [] which fully inverts the left hand side of the MME. Following the Monte Carlo sampling procedure described above  100 000 samples of the extracted data set were simulated assuming a  of 1.0 and  of 3.0. For each of the simulated data sets MME  using the same design matrix (X) as used when estimating the PEV  were set up and solved using MiX99 []. The sampled PEV of the  for each animal in the pedigree was approximated using the formulations of the sampled PEV described in Table  using  samples ( = 50  100  ...  950  1000). Stochastic approximations of the sampling variance of the sampled PEV were calculated using 100 independent replicates of the  samples  and using the leave-one-out Jackknife on  samples  for the different formulations  with the exception of PEV and PEV. To calculate the sampling variance for PEV and PEV using  independent replicates would have required more than 100 000 samples (due to the need to generate sampling variances of component formulations) generated for this study so therefore these were not considered. Asymptotic sampling variances for all ten formulations were calculated using the formulae in Table . Of the formulations presented in Table   PEV and PEV are weighted averages of PEV and PEV and of PEV and PEV respectively with the weighting dependent on the sampling variances of the component formulations. Garcia-Cortes  [] suggest weighting by asymptotic approximations of the sampling variances. The sampling variances could also be approximated empirically using independent replicates of  samples or by leave-one-out Jackknife procedures [  ]. These alternative weighting strategies were compared by calculating sampling variances using 100 independent replicates of the  samples  using the  samples and a leave-one-out Jackknife procedure []  and using the asymptotic sampling variances outlined in Table  as part of an iterative procedure  which involved two iterations. In the first iterations the asymptotic sampling variances were calculated using the PEV and PEV of the component formulations  in the second they used the PEV approximated in the first iteration. It was not possible to store each of the 100 000 simulated values for each of the 50 435 animals in the main memory of the computer simultaneously meaning that textbook formulae to calculate the different variances and covariances required for the different formulations was not possible. Textbook updating algorithms to calculate the variance can be numerically unreliable []. Instead the required variances were calculated using a one pass updating algorithm based on Chan  [] which updates the estimated sum of squares with a new record as it reads through the data and takes the form: where  are the number samples at any stage in the updating procedure and  and  are the sum and sum of squares of the data points 1 through . It was modified to calculate the covariances between X and Y by changing  to . Both of these algorithms were tested using one replication of 100 000 samples and found to be stable. As the  was taken to be 1.0  the PEV ranged between 0.00 and 1.0. For the purpose of categorizing the results PEV with values between 0.00 and 0.33 were regarded as low  values between 0.34 and 0.66 were regarded as medium  and values between 0.67 and 1.00 were regarded as high. Henderson [] showed that it is much easier to form  than   where  is the numerator relationship matrix among animals. This follows from the fact that  if the individuals are listed with ancestors above descendants   can be written as ' where  is a diagonal matrix and  is a lower triangular matrix with non-zero diagonal elements and    th elements that are non-zero if the  th individual is an ancestor of the  th []. The matrix  has a simple inverse with both the diagonal elements and    th elements being non-zero if the  th individual is a parent of the  th individual. Hence  has a simple inverse. It is interesting to note that an animal effect can be written as an accumulation of independent terms from its ancestors   where and are the additive genetic effects of the sire and dam of animal  and is the Mendelian sampling effect with variance   where is the average inbreeding of the parents of animal . Hence there is a simple recursive procedure for generation of the additive effects by generating independent Mendelian sampling terms with diagonal variance matrix . While all different formulations of the sampled PEV converged to the PEV and the sampling variance of the PEV reduced as the number of samples () increased  convergence rates differed between the formulations. For example  PEV converged at a slower rate than all other formulations when the convergence rate was measured by the correlation between PEV and sampled PEV (Fig. ). PEV  PEV  PEV  and PEV  all converged at a very similar rates and had the best convergence across all formulations.     . PEV  PEV  PEV are not shown as they have trends  which match PEV As well as depending on the numbers of samples  the convergence rate also depended on the level of the PEV. The sampled PEV calculated using different formulations had different sampling variances and within each formulation the sampling variances differed depending on the level of the PEV (Fig. ). Of the previously published formulations PEV and PEV had low sampling variance at high PEV  with PEV being better than PEV. PEV had low sampling variance at low PEV. Accounting for the effects of sampling on the Var(u) reduced the sampling variance in regions where the previously published formulations had high sampling variances but had little (or even slightly negative) effect where these formulations had low sampling variances. PEV  which is the alternative version of PEV gave major improvements in terms of sampling variance low and intermediate PEV. Its performance was almost identical to PEV  PEV  and PEV  which had low sampling variance at both high and low PEV. No formulation had relatively low sampling variance for intermediate PEV. . () Sampling variances for PEV and PEV. () Sampling variances for PEV and PEV. () Sampling variances for PEV and PEV. () Sampling variances for PEV and PEV. Empirical sampling variances were approximated using 100 independent replicates and presented as averages within windows of 0.001 of the exact prediction error variance. PEV  and PEV were similar to PEV. Different formulations were compared in greater detail using  = 300 samples (Table )  which is a practical number of samples. PEV  PEV  PEV  and PEV were the best formulations across all of the ten formulations. The slopes and R of their regressions were always among the best where PEV was low  intermediate  or high (Table ). These formulations gave good approximations at both high and low PEV their performance was less good at intermediate PEV  measured by each of the summary statistics (Table ). PEV and PEV gave good approximations for high PEV and poor approximations for low PEV. PEV gave good approximations for low PEV and poor approximations for high PEV. Improving the published formulations by correcting for the effects of sampling resulted in better approximations in areas where the published formulations were weak. Slight (dis)improvements were observed where the previously published formulations were strong. Of the new formulations PEV gave poor approximations and PEV gave good approximations. Using the three alternative weighting strategies to combine the component formulations for PEV and PEV gave almost identical results (Table ). The formulations PEV  PEV  PEV  and PEV gave similar approximations and had the lowest sampling variance. Even when a few samples ( = 50) were used  low and high PEV were well approximated and intermediate PEV were poorly approximated. Correlations between PEV and PEV were 0.88 for low  0.96 for high PEV and 0.51 for intermediate PEV. To increase the correlation for intermediate PEV to at least 0.90 at least 550 samples was needed. At this number of samples the correlations for low and high PEV were = 0.99. To obtain a satisfactory level of convergence 300 samples were sufficient. Ten different formulations of the PEV approximated using sampling were compared and these were each shown to converge to the PEV at different rates. Within each of these formulations differences in convergence were observed at different levels of PEV. PEV and its corresponding alternative formulation PEV make use of information on the Var(). PEV and its corresponding alternative formulation PEV makes use of information on the Var(u - ). The sampling variance of the Var() is lower at high PEV than it is at low PEV (Fig. )  therefore the formulations using information on the Var() are more suited to approximating high PEV than to low PEV. The opposite is the case for formulations which use information on the Var(u - )  they perform better at low PEV. Formulations PEV  PEV  and PEV use information on both the Var()and the Var (u - ) and result in curves for their sampling variance which are symmetric about the mean PEV. They either explicitly or implicitly weight this information by the inverse of its sampling variance. PEV and PEV make use of information on the C(u  ). () and Var(u - ). With infinite samples the Var(u) is equal to the   but due to sampling error resulting from using a limited number of samples this not likely to be true in practice. Therefore each of the alternative formulations makes use of information on the Var(u) in addition to making use of information on either/or/both of the Var() and the Var(u - ) or the C(u  ). The Var() = Cov(u  ) when the Cov((u - )  ) = 0. The Var() <U+2260> Cov(u  ) when the Cov((u - )  ) <U+2260> 0. Of the ten different approaches four competitive formulations  PEV  PEV  PEV  and PEV  were identified. These gave similar approximations. Of the four  two  PEV and PEV  were weighted averages of component formulations. The weighting was based on the sampling variances of their component formulations. These sampling variances can be calculated using a number of independent replicates  using Jackknife procedures  or asymptotically. Each of these approaches gave almost identical results but the Jackknife and asymptotic approaches were far less computationally demanding. A single BLUP evaluation for the routine Irish multiple breed beef genetic cattle evaluation (January 2007) which included a pedigree of 1 500 000 and 493 092 animals with performance records on at least one of the 15 traits could be run using MiX99 [] in 366 min on a 64 bit PC  with a 2.40 GHz AMD Opteron dual-core processor and 8 gigabytes of RAM []. Using  = 300 samples and PEV the accuracy of the estimated breeding values could be estimated in 1 830 hours on a single processor. Several samples can be solved simultaneously on multiple processors thereby reducing computer time. Nowadays PC's are available that contain two quad core 64 bit processors ( 8 CPU's) and cost approximately 5 000 euro. Using six of these PC's the accuracy of estimated breeding values for the Irish data set could be estimated in less than 38.1 h. The Monte Carlo sampling approach using one of these four competitive formulations can be used to improve many tasks in animal breeding. Stochastic REML algorithms [ []] can be improved in terms of speed of calculation using these formulations  therefore allowing variance components to be estimated using REML in large data sets. These REML formulations are usually written in terms of additive genetic effects ' and  []  where  is the prediction error covariance matrix for the estimated breeding values. The results of Henderson [] show how the REML formulations can be equivalently written as in terms of Mendelian sampling effects  ' and  []  where is the prediction error covariance matrix for the Mendelian sampling effects. As is diagonal we see that we only need to compute the sampling variances of the Mendelian sampling terms. When the sampling was carried out in this study we  in error  did not correct the Mendelian sampling terms for inbreeding. We therefore have only reported results for non-inbred animals and think that the incorrect generation will have a minimal effect on the sampling variances  which are presented as an empirical check on the formulae. There may be circumstances where a Stochastic REML approach may be faster than Gibbs sampling and have less bias than Method R []. Calculating variance components using more complete data sets would facilitate a reduction in the bias of estimated variance components caused by the ignoring of data on which selection has taken place in the population []  due to computational limitations. Calculation of unbiased accuracy of within breed [] and across breed [] estimated breeding values can be improved by reducing the computational time required of calculation or reducing the sampling error for a given computational time. Application of an algorithm controlling the variance of response to selection [] to large data sets can be speeded up. The variance of response to selection is a risk to breeding programs []  which is generally not explicitly controlled using the approach outlined by Meuwissen [] due to the inability to generate a prediction error (co)variance matrix for large data sets. Computational power is a major limitation of stochastic methods  particularly when large data sets are involved  however this is dissipating rapidly with the improvement in processor speed  parallelization  and the adoption of 64-bit technology  however in the meantime deterministic methods will continue to be used for large scale BLUP analysis. PEV approximations using Monte Carlo estimation were affected by the formulation used to calculate the PEV. The difference between the formulations was small when the number of samples increased  but differed depending on the level of the exact PEV and the number of samples. Rescaling from the scale of Var(u) to the scale of  improved the approximation of the PEV and four of the 10 formulations gave the best approximations of PEV thereby improving the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling procedure for calculating the PEV. The fewer samples that are required the less the computational time will be. Henderson CR: Best linear unbiased estimation and prediction under a selection model.

All individuals were analyzed for sequence variation in the mtDNA control region. Among fourteen haplotypes detected  four previously unpublished haplotypes  bearing a close relationship to haplotypes of the Adriatic and  lineages of   were revealed. Ten previously described haplotypes  characteristic of    and the Adriatic and Mediterranean lineages of   were also detected. Haplotypes detected in this study were placed in a well supported branch of   and a cluster of Mediterranean – Adriatic –  haplotypes  which were further delimited into three subdivisions of Mediterranean    and a previously non-described formation of four Adriatic haplotypes (Balkan cluster). Haplotypes of the Balkan cluster and the other Adriatic haplotypes  do not represent a contiguous haplotype lineage and appear not to be closely related  indicating independent arrivals into the Adriatic drainage and suggesting successive colonization events. Despite the presence of  haplotypes in Albania  no marbled phenotype was found  confirming previously reported findings that there is no association between this phenotype and  haplotypes. Major European peninsulas are known to have played a central role in the survival of animal and plants during ice-age maxima and have received a high degree of attention in terms of conservation of endemic taxa [  ]. Compared with the Iberian and Italian peninsulas  the biodiversity and rich level of phenotypic variability present in the Balkan Peninsula have only recently been investigated by molecular techniques ( [–]). As one of the 17 biodiversity hotspots of the world []  this peninsula harbours numerous endemic taxa []  including members of the genus  (subsequently referred to as Balkan trout)  which are especially diverse in this region. Many studies on the morphology and phenotypes of the fish of the Balkans were undertaken during the last century ( [  ]) and found high levels of endemism among Balkan trout. As a consequence  given the benefit of availability of modern molecular techniques  a number of recent studies have focused on revisiting Balkan trout taxonomy  population structure and demographic history [–]. However  much remains to be done  as the status of several nominal species and populations of Balkan trout remains unresolved  mainly as a result of the region's geographical  political and cultural isolation []. Considerable variation in external morphology of Balkan trout was reported in early studies [  ]  giving rise to many taxonomic units (see [] for review). Recent molecular studies of trout from Bosnia-Herzegovina  Montenegro and FYROM [    ] have confirmed this diversity. However  little clear association between phenotype and genotype has been found  and some well-established taxonomic groups  such as  []  have been found not to be associated with detected genetic assemblages. Several  taxa have been reported to inhabit Albanian rivers and neighbouring drainages in FYROM and Greece. Examples include   proposed by Karaman []  and              and  [      ]. Unfortunately  confirmation of these observations and the continued existence of such trout in these waters  as well as their taxonomic status  remain uncertain  representing an absence from any comprehensive overview of Balkan trout demography  evolution and classification. The data that do exist on trout in Albania are very scarce and mostly stem from an inventory of fishes undertaken in the country in the 1950s []  or are restricted to certain areas ( [] on Lake Ohrid; [] on the River Shkumbini). Rakaj [] extended and brought up to date the work of Poljakov . [] on Albanian ichthyofauna. He described trout from the rivers Shala and Valbona (Ohrid-Drin-Shkodra system; see also []) as well as from the lakes Shkodra and Ohrid  while trout have also been reported to exist within the rivers Bistrica []  Cemit []  Mati [] and Shkumbini []. Very few genetic analyses of Albanian trout have been performed so far and all are restricted to lakes Ohrid and Prespa [    ]. As inferred from several previous studies on Balkan trout [  ]  anthropogenically induced hybridisation  particularly with introduction of non-native trout lineages  has had a considerable impact on many indigenous trout stocks and has blurred the picture of the original genetic structure and phylogeography of Balkan trout. However  because of Albania's past political isolation and low level of economic development  it is probable that stocking with non-native strains of brown trout ( Atlantic lineage) has not been performed here (I Wilson  personal communication). Therefore  despite any impact of over-fishing and intense poaching (authors' personal observations) on the population sizes of native trout  the present distribution and composition of trout in Albania may relatively faithfully reflect the natural situation  a rare situation for salmonid rivers in Europe given the widespread practice of stocking. In the present survey  we analysed for the first time samples from a both extensive and intensive collection of trout from Albania and from some neighbouring drainages in FYROM and Greece (13 river basins altogether) along with  and  from Albanian waters of Lake Ohrid. The main objective of this study was to determine the genetic architecture of Albanian trout from analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR)  and thus obtain phylogeographic information that could be compared with published data and make inferences on the historical demography and evolution of Balkan trout. We also looked for any indication of association between phenotype and mtDNA lineage. In 2005 and 2006  a total of 78 sampling sites were electrofished in rivers in Albania and the Megali Prespa basin in FYROM and Greece. The sampling in Albania (73 sampling sites) was performed not only to undertake a trout census in the country but also for the entire ichthyofauna. Locations were selected based upon observations published in the literature [    ] and from local people. Emphasis was placed on both main water streams and isolated locations. Among the sampled locations in Albania  trout were found at 15 of them (Fig. ). Cake and Miho [] reported trout at sites 61 and 63 (Fig. ) in the River Shkumbini basin. However  during our sampling campaign  trout were not observed here  though they were found and sampled in two previously non-described locations within this catchment (62 and 64  Table ). In addition  trout were observed for the first time in the River Mati catchment. On the other hand  they were not found at site 35 (on the River Tragjas)  where local people report their existence. . Sites where trout were found are marked with black (see Table 1); white spots are the sampling stations sampled without trout; dotted lines show the main river catchment. Trout were found at four of the five locations sampled in the Megali Prespa basin (in Greece and FYROM)  including sites 70 and 71  where  according to the literature [    ]  they were expected to exist  and at sites 72 and 74. Trout were not observed at site 73. The authors' general observation was that poaching for trout was very common in the area sampled  and where trout still exist  the observed densities were very low. The 87 trout collected from 19 sites (Figure  and Table ) were sorted among three species and one genus:  (5)   (5) and  (20)  and  (57). While the first two species are easily recognizable on the basis of both their distinct phenotype and specific native range (Lake Ohrid)  the classification of  was based upon its very restricted distribution (see []). The other specimens were phenotypically indefinable and were therefore assigned as . Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes detected in Albania  Greece and FYROM are reported in Table  and all the haplotypes used in phylogenetic analysis are listed in Table . Total DNA was isolated from fin tissue preserved in 96% ethanol following the protocol of Medrano . []. The entire sequence of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 28RIBa [] and HN20 []. Each 30 µL reaction included 1 µM of each primer  0.2 µM dNTP  1.5 µM MgCl  1 × PCR buffer  1 U  polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. The conditions for PCR were initial denaturation (95°C  3 min) followed by 30 cycles of strand denaturation (94°C  45 s)  primer annealing (52°C  45 s) and DNA extension (72°C  2 min). All PCR amplifications were performed in a programmable thermocycler GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Amplified DNA fragments were run on a 1.5% gel and isolated from the gel using the QIAEX II gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). The control region fragment between the tRNA gene and poly T-block of the amplified DNA (100 ng of purified PCR product) was sequenced using primer 28RIBa following ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator protocols (Applied Biosystems 3.1). The amplified DNA was salt-precipitated and analysed with an ABI PRISM 310 automated sequencer. Sequences of the 5'-end of the mtDNA CR (ca. 561 bp) were aligned using the computer program ClustalX []. To assign individual haplotypes to trout species and lineages previously identified within the brown trout species complex  data were aligned against at least three haplotypes from each lineage (Me: Mediterranean; Ma: ; Da: Danubian; At: Atlantic)  and compared to all known haplotypes found in trout samples across the Adriatic river system (Ad; Table ). Aligned haplotypes were imported into the program PAUP Version 4.0b10 [] for phylogenetic analysis. Neighbour-Joining (NJ)  maximum parsimony (MP)  maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analysis were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. For NJ  a Kimura 2-parameter model was chosen. For MP  insertions or deletions (indels) were included as a fifth character. A heuristic search (10 replicates) with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping was employed to find the most parsimonious trees. For ML  a sequence evolution model was first chosen using the program Modeltest Version 3.7 [] incorporated into PAUP. After choosing a model  a heuristic search (10 replicates) was used to estimate the most likely topology. Support values for the nodes were obtained with 1000 bootstrap replicates for MP  NJ  or ML analysis  whereby the fast stepwise addition method was used for ML. Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes version 3.1.2 [] where posterior probabilities were obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique (Nst = 6  Rates = gamma  Ngen = 5 000 000  chains = 4). Because of weak support for the Adriatic clade as a whole (see Results ) the genealogical relation of these haplotypes was also depicted using a 95% statistical parsimony network constructed from the 5'-end of mtDNA CR sequences using program TCS 1.3 []. Resolution of ambiguous loops in the TCS network was performed by comparing ML pair-wise distances of the haplotypes within a loop and identifying the most likely connections within it  reflected by the smallest pair-wise distances. ML pair-wise distances were computed under the model (HKY 85) using the program PAUP Version 4.0b10 []. A total of 561 bp of the mtDNA CR was resolved in 87 individuals and compared with corresponding and already published sequences of various  taxa. In Lake Ohrid  five haplotypes  all previously described in Sušnik . [] (marked with \"Haplo\")  were found  four of which were detected in  (Haplo 1  4  5 and 6) and one in  (Haplo 12). For the other samples  five already described haplotypes characteristic of the Adriatic (4) and Mediterranean (1) lineages of  were found. In addition  four previously unpublished haplotypes bearing close relation to others of the Adriatic (Ad-AL1 to 3) and  (Ma-AL1) were also detected.  from the FYROM part of the Prespa basin were fixed for haplotype ADcs1; this haplotype was also found in the River Valbona system in Albania (River Drin basin). Haplotype AdPrz was found in the rivers Valbona and Shala (also River Drin basin). Haplo14  previously considered private for  in Lake Ohrid []  was in this study found to exist also in trout in the Drin basin. It is worth noting that all the samples from the River Bistrica were fixed for Ma-AL1  but none exhibited any phenotypic character state characteristic of  (field observations). The highest level of genetic variation appeared to be in the Drin basin (haplotypes ADcs1  AdPrz and Haplo14) and the most common haplotype found in this study was ADcs1  found in Lake Prespa tributaries and the River Valbona. The phylogenetic organisation of the NJ distance tree clearly identified four well supported branches (Fig. ): (i)  with Haplo1  4  5 and 6  (ii) the reference Danubian haplotypes  (iii) the reference Atlantic haplotypes  and (iv) a cluster of Mediterranean  Adriatic and  (ME-AD-MA) haplotypes exhibiting a very complex but poorly supported clade. All previously unreported haplotypes appeared in this clade.   . In addition to haplotypes characteristic of Balkan trout from the Adriatic and Aegean drainages (Ad)  three haplotypes representing Mediterranean (Me)  Danubian (Da) and Atlantic (At) drainages were included in the analyses; haplotypes characteristic for Lake Ohrid  are marked with \"Haplo\"; bootstrap support values refer  from top to bottom  to NJ  maximum parsimony  maximum likelihood (HKY+I+G model  transition: transversion 2.6389; proportion of invariable sites (I) 0.6060; gamma distribution shape parameter 0.7375) and Bayesian methods; values <50 are marked with \"/\" or are not marked when there was no value above 50 in any of the analyses. Character state phylogenetic (  MP  ML and Bayesian) analyses revealed similar tree-topology with regard to the four main clades (Fig. ) and provided a better resolution of the ME-AD-MA clade showing clear delimitation of three subdivisions: two already accepted groups of Mediterranean (iv-a) and  (iv-b) haplotypes [  ]  and (iv-c)  a previously non-described formation of haplotypes AdRc  AdPrz  AdC1 and AdN (hereafter referred to as the Balkan cluster). The topology of the other Adriatic haplotypes remained largely unresolved. A network gathering the haplotypes found in this study and those previously published [  ] is presented in Figure . Haplotype MEcs1 was found to exhibit several autapomorphies  which separated it considerably from other haplotypes and complicated the resolution of the network (data not shown). For this reason  this haplotype was excluded from further analysis. The general organization of the haplotype network obtained in this study featuring a multiple star-like structure with ADcs1 taking a central position was similar to the one reported by Cortey . [] and confirmed in Sušnik . []. Those newly described are only one (Ad-AL2  Ad-AL3 and Ma-AL1) or two (Ad-AL1) mutation steps away from previously described haplotypes. AdPrz  a common haplotype in the southern Adriatic drainage []  and AdRc and AdC1 from Lake Shkodra basin [] and AdN from the River Neretva basin [] form a separate group in the network  supporting the existence of the corresponding clade inferred from the phylogenetic tree (iv-c  Fig. ). Interestingly   haplotypes were found to be incorporated into the Adriatic clade network being apparently closely related to haplotypes predominantly detected in Ohrid trout ().  [  ]. Lines  regardless of length  represent single mutational events and link the haplotypes; black dots represent missing or theoretical haplotype; haplotypes found in Albania are in a square  those from Lake Ohrid are in light grey  those linked to  in black  while Ma haplotypes are in dark grey; most likely connections of the haplotypes within ambiguous loops  based on ML pair-wise distances are displayed with thick lines This study reveals for the first time the phylogenetic structure of trout populations in one of the last remaining incompletely explored regions of trout distribution in Europe. Drainages in Albania are linked to neighbouring systems in FYROM and Greece that also belong to the Adriatic river system as a whole. These rivers and lakes have been largely unmanaged with respect to stocking of non-native strains of trout  in contrast with most of the rest of Europe. However  stocking with trout from the same location has been practised over many years in Lake Ohrid  and in at least one tributary of Lake Prespa. Therefore  it was expected that non-native genetic signatures would not be detected and  indeed  this was the case:  no haplotypes of Atlantic or Danubian brown trout phylogenetic lineages were found. Instead  Albanian trout populations are characterised by mtDNA haplotypes from the three other previously defined brown trout lineages []: Adriatic  Mediterranean and . All of these three lineages are native to Mediterranean river systems. Moreover  Lake Ohrid contains the endemic species  (more closely related to  of the Dalmatian river systems)  with its unique haplotypes. Such pronounced genetic diversity places Albanian trout populations among the most variable in Europe. This finding is even more remarkable when one considers the very limited geographic distribution of these trout in Albania and the neighbouring area. Out of 78 locations sampled  we expected to find trout in at least 25 of them but were able to catch trout only in 19 sites. With few exceptions (sites 39 40 41) trout were always at very low density and it was difficult to catch more than five in several stations  probably as a result of heavy poaching by net  dynamite and chlorine. Consequently  although trout also exist in remote areas they are in danger of extinction. Lake Ohrid  the oldest lake in Europe  is shared between FYROM and Albania. According to historical data [] and recent studies [      ] at least two trout species   and   inhabit the lake and samples of both were included in this survey. Genetic analysis  including of mtDNA  has already been performed for these two taxa [  ]. The results obtained in the present study corroborate the earlier findings  justifying the distinct taxonomic position of  in relation to its congeners  and supporting the species status of Ohrid trout  for conservation purposes []. The present study found a high frequency of Haplo14 in the Drin river system (previously reported only for Lake Ohrid)  an unsurprising finding since until 1960 no dams existed along this river and Lake Ohrid was connected directly with rest of the system. The second largest lake in the region  of Tertiary origin (>5 MY)  is Lake Megali Prespa  whose tributaries are inhabited by  []. During the Jurassic  lakes Prespa and Ohrid formed part of the Dassaretic lakes  which were linked with the Adriatic Sea. Trout from the River Agios Germanos  now a tributary of this lake after the stream was diverted from Lake Mikri Prespa between 1935 and 1945  have already been analysed at allozyme loci [] and for mtDNA sequence variation []. On the basis of a diagnostic allele at *  this population was first thought to be distinct from other populations of brown trout in Greece. However  based on subsequent partial mtDNA CR and cyt b gene sequence analysis  it was then placed back in the  complex. All the populations of  examined in the present study were fixed for the haplotype ADcs1  which distinguished them from all trout populations surveyed here apart from the population from the River Valbona (Drin basin)  where this haplotype was also found. A recent hypothesis concerning demographic patterns of the Adriatic lineage [  ] considers ADcs1 as the central haplotype (Fig. ): it is the most common haplotype in the Iberian Peninsula  where the Adriatic lineage is thought to have originated []. The plesiomorphic state of the haplotype ADcs1 and its presence in  indicates its ancestry within the Adriatic lineage and does not support the recognition of this taxon as a separate species. Nevertheless  given that .  is distinct morphologically from all other Balkan trout [] and restricted geographically to Lake Megali Prespa basin  we stress the importance of this taxon as a unit that needs conserving. No marbling phenotype characteristic of marble trout was observed in any of the individual trout caught in the present study  even though  has been reported to be present in the rivers Valbona and Drin [    ]. On the other hand  the  haplotype (Ma-A1) was detected in southern Albania  in the River Bistrica where Rakaj [] has described the local form as . As no marbling was observed in the trout from this river  this supports the view that the  s mtDNA lineage and the marbling phenotype are not linked: previous reports have described the existence of  haplotypes in many populations of phenotypically brown trout across the Mediterranean river basins  including rivers in Dalmatia []  central Italy []  Greece [] and Corsica (unpublished data). The marbling phenotype is only characteristic of this lineage in its north Adriatic range  where the phenotype was first described [  ]. Much effort has been put in resolving salmonid genetic structure and phylogeographic signals in the Adriatic drainage [  –        ]. To update the overall current picture  genetic data on samples from Albania and neighbouring freshwater systems in FYROM and Greece can now be incorporated into previously obtained data and used to make inferences on trout phylogeography and historical demography in the western Balkans and supplement the current knowledge concerning the rest of the Adriatic drainage. The presence of four evolutionary lineage haplotypes (of     and Adriatic and Mediterranean ) in Albania points to a complicated demographic history and rich diversity of trout populations in the country. The lineages AD and ME  both reported here as present in Albania  have been studied and reviewed thoroughly by Cortey . [] who suggested that they had originated in the Iberian peninsula some 150 000 years ago  with haplotypes ADcs1 and MEcs1 as the most ancestral  respectively. It is thought that these lineages expanded together from west to east across the Mediterranean basin during the extreme Pleistocene glacial maxima and therefore would have reached the western Balkans relatively recently. In Albania  the ME haplotype (MEcs1) was found in a single river basin (River Mati)  and was the only haplotype present there. Indications of a patchwork distribution of ME haplotypes have already been reported for the western Mediterranean drainages []  the Aegean and Adriatic drainages in Greece [] and in central Italy []. As Albanian rivers represent the limit of the geographical range of the ME lineage  it seemed likely that here the concentration of such haplotypes would be low and that they would be very sensitive to stochastic events (gene flow  bottlenecks  etc.). Such events appear to have been particularly intense in the Balkan Peninsula during the Pleistocene [] and could be the main reason for both the present geographical limitations of distribution and local fixation of the MEcs1 haplotype. A complex and particularly fuzzy phylogenetic relationship among AD haplotypes  already observed by Cortey . [] and Sušnik . []  was noticed in this study  and only the so-called Balkan cluster (haplotypes AdN  AdRc  AdC1 and AdPrz) was well resolved  with a bootstrap value of 100 per cent in MP and 86 per cent in Bayesian. This cluster corresponds to the AdN-AdPrz cluster previously described by Maric . [] and Razpet . [] for the rivers Neretva and Prizrenska Bistrica. In those studies  the distribution of haplotypes corresponded well with the distribution of the questionable taxon  (from rivers Krka (Croatia)  Neretva (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Prizrenska Bistrica (Kosova)  tributaries of Lake Shkodra (Montenegro) and of the River Drin and Lake Ohrid) [  ]. Two additional haplotypes constituting the Balkan cluster and used here as reference haplotypes  AdRc and AdC1  also originate from the  range (Lake Shkodra tributaries; see []) and additionally support the proposed haplotype-species association. In this study  the haplotype AdPrz was found in the River Drin basin  the eastern limit of the range of   and close to the type location of Prizren  which shares the same water shed. Thus  the results from this study support the congruence of the distribution of the Balkan haplotype cluster and the range of . As reported previously [  ]  haplotypes of the Balkan cluster  including AdPrz  on the one hand and other Ad haplotypes on the other hand  do not represent a contiguous haplotype lineage (see Fig. ) and appear not to be closely related  indicating independent arrivals into the Adriatic drainage and suggesting successive colonization events. The data referring to the distribution of the  haplotype in Albania do not contribute much to resolving contradictory notions about the centre of origin and demographic patterns of  lineage (c.f.  [      ]). The newly described Ma-AL1 haplotype  recorded for a previously non-surveyed location in Albania  broadens the known genetic diversity of the  lineage  and highlights its extensive but patchy distribution  as observed across a broad stretch of Mediterranean river systems [    ]. Balkan trout are composed of a genetic mosaic of haplotypes  related to most of the other trout lineages of the Mediterranean area analysed and reported in other studies. However  due to a complexity of past migrations  colonisations and extinctions  as well as that of many other organisms []  the Balkans has been considered a hotspot of trout biodiversity. The region's unique mix of habitats and topography has created a peninsula rich in endemism  and ironically its isolation (both physical and political) has helped to conserve a complex structure of trout populations  particularly in Albania. This first investigation of a little explored area has revealed a glimpse into a partly understandable and partly fuzzy web of relationships.

A review of models for data with genotype × environment interactions and related problems is given  linking early  analysis of variance based formulations to their modern  mixed model counterparts. It is shown that models developed for the analysis of multi-environment trials in plant breeding are directly applicable in animal breeding. In particular  the 'additive main effect  multiplicative interaction' models accommodate heterogeneity of variance and are characterised by a factor-analytic covariance structure. While this can be implemented in mixed models by imposing such structure on the genetic covariance matrix in a standard  multi-trait model  an equivalent model is obtained by fitting the common and specific factors genetic separately. Properties of the mixed model equations for alternative implementations of factor-analytic models are discussed  and extensions to structured modelling of covariance matrices for multi-trait  multi-environment scenarios are described. Factor analytic models provide a natural framework for modelling genotype × environment interaction type problems. Mixed model analyses fitting such models are likely to see increasing use due to the parsimonious description of covariance structures available  the scope for direct interpretation of factors as well as computational advantages. It has long been recognised that expression of genotypes is altered by environmental conditions. This can result in differences in variability as well as different ranking of genotypes in different environments. Classic analyses of such genotype by environment interaction (G × E) modelled G × E effects in just that manner: as an interaction effect in a two-way classification with genotypes and environments as main effects  in an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Assuming genotypes and interaction effects are random  such basic model generally implies a constant variance of G × E effects and  for more than two environments  a uniform genetic correlation across all environments. Often  this is too restrictive and a number of other models and methods have been developed  both in animal and plant breeding applications; see  for instance  Freeman [] for a review of early approaches  Cameron [] for an outline of more modern methods  and James [] for a recent exposé. Falconer [] perceived that treating performance of genotypes in different environments as different  correlated traits provides an alternative way to model G × E effects. As individuals are general limited to a single environment  this relies on the availability of close relatives in the other environments to create genetic links. This approach allows for a more flexible covariance structure which can account for both scale and rank interactions. Generally  the resulting  multi-trait genetic covariance matrix is treated as 'unstructured' which  for  environments  comprises ( + 1)/2 distinct covariances. At the other extreme  the 'compound symmetry' structure implied by the two-way ANOVA with interaction involves two parameters  the genetic variance and the variance due to G × E effects. When there are many environments  estimation of an unstructured covariance matrix can be infeasible. Hence  there has been considerable interest in fitting a structure to the covariance matrix which is flexible enough to accommodate heterogeneity of variances and some differences in genetic correlations between environments  but  at the same time  is parsimonious enough to allow estimation of the parameters involved with reasonable accuracy. Recently  interest has focused on structures which utilise the leading principal components of a covariance matrix  as it has become understood that such structures can be fitted directly within the mixed model framework commonly employed for estimation and prediction in quantitative genetic analyses [  ]. This encompasses both reduced rank and factor-analytic (FA) models. Added impetus for the use of FA models has come from plant breeding applications  especially the analysis of variety trials carried out in a range of locations. There has been increasing use of mixed model methodology in this field  for both the estimation of (co)variance components and the prediction of genetic merit for varietal selection  e.g. [–]. This has been stimulated by the recognition that analyses fitting a factor analytic (FA) structure for genotype effects provide the mixed model equivalent to previous  ANOVA based models such as the 'additive main effects  multiplicative interaction' (AMMI) model or regression type models such as the Finlay-Wilkinson model []; see Smith . [] or Piepho . [] for detailed reviews. A particular G × E problem in livestock improvement is that of international genetic evaluation. For dairy cattle  'multiple-trait across country evaluation' (MACE) of dairy sires is well established. Loosely described  this utilises a type of adjusted daughter average instead of individual observations  as suggested by Schaeffer []. With a considerable number of participating countries  various approaches for a structured parameterisation of the matrices of genetic correlations between countries have been examined  including those fitting reduced rank covariance matrices [–] or an approximate FA structure [  ]. Few other applications have been reported even though maximum likelihood estimation of genetic covariance matrices with a FA structure has been considered early on in other areas []. This paper presents a review of FA models and examines their implementation in the standard  linear mixed model framework. Particular focus is on the utility of FA model for genotype × environment type problems  considering scenarios where the genetic covariance matrix is adequately represented by a FA or reduced rank structure. A natural formulation for a G × E problem is in form of a two-way classification with interaction. Let denote the -th record for the -th genotype in the -th environment  and the additive effects of genotype  and environment   the respective interaction effect   the overall mean and <U+03F5>the residual error term. This gives model =  + + + + <U+03F5> (1) Separation of the interaction component from the error <U+03F5>requires repeated records per G × E subclass. Assume we have a 'full' two-way table of G × E effects  i.e. that for  genotypes and  environments  there are  terms . This implies that fitting an interaction not only involves a substantial number of additional terms  but can also account for a large proportion of the total degrees of freedom available. Hence  there has been long standing interest in identifying the sources of non-additivity  dating back as far as Tukey []  and in more parsimonious modelling of the interaction effects. In addition to reducing the number of effects fitted  structural models can afford an insight into the nature of G × E effects. A bewildering number of alternatives for such models  as used in the analysis of plant breeding trials are catalogued by van Eeuwijk [  ]. A widely used model  attributed to Finlay and Wilkinson []  involves a regression on the environmental effect  i.e. =  + + (1 + ) + <U+03F5> (2) with the regression coefficient for the -th genotype. The environmental effect may be estimated from the data or be comprised of an external  environmental covariable. A more flexible alternative is a multiplicative model  where each G × E effect is modelled as the product of a genotypic score and an environmental score. More generally  we can model interactions as the weighted sum of products of a number of scores  with and the -th genetic and environmental score  and the corresponding weight. The number of factors to describe the interaction    can be at most  - 1 or  - 1  whichever is the smaller. In practice   is generally chosen much smaller. Parts of the interaction terms not accounted for by the  factors fitted are then included in the residual in (3)  . A convenient way to determine the scores and weights in (3) is via a singular value decomposition of the matrix formed by the two-way table of G × E effects. This combines the features of ANOVA and factor (or principal component) analysis  and has thus been referred to as FANOVA []. Examples of applications  together with discussions on related problems such as tests of significance  partitioning of degrees of freedom  interpretation of factor scores and unbalanced data are given by various authors  e.g. [–]. Let   of size  ×  represent the two-way table of G × E effects. Applying a singular value decomposition then yields  =  (4) with  = Diag {} the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues  and  = {} and  = {} the matrices of left and right singular vectors of .  is obtained as the matrix of eigenvectors of  and  as that of . In the simplest case  the elements of  may be estimated as means for individual G × E effects. Other suggestions  in particular for unbalanced scenarios  have been to adjust the G × E cell means for the least-squares estimates of overall mean  genotype and environment effects [  ]. For such scores  the model given in (3) thus  in essence  describes the interaction terms by considering the  leading principal components of  only. The resulting model has become known as AMMI model  standing for 'additive main effects  multiplicative interaction' [  ]. An alternative classification in use is that of a bi-linear or bi-additive model []. In some instances  one or both of the main effects are not fitted and the principal component analysis is performed on the combined effects rather than the interaction alone. Some authors refer to such variations of AMMI models as shifted multiplicative models [  ]. Initial applications of FANOVA or AMMI models considered fixed effects scenarios. Treating environments and interactions as random  Piepho [] modelled data from plant cultivar trials using the multiplicative models described above  and showed that such models yield a covariance matrix between observations of the same form as that obtained when imposing a factor-analytic structure []  i.e. given by ' +  with the number of columns of  equal to the number of factors considered and  a diagonal matrix. Smith . [] presented a corresponding case with genotypes as random and environments considered to be fixed effects. Loosely speaking  factor analysis is concerned with identifying the common factors which give rise to correlations between variables. This involves fitting a latent variable model. In contrast  principal component analysis aims at identifying factors which explain a maximum amount of variation  and does not imply any underlying model. Let  denote a vector of  random variables with covariance matrix . We then model  as  = +  +  (5) with  a vector of means    of length   the vector of common factors    of length   the vector of residuals or specific effects  and   of size  ×   the so-called matrix of factor loadings. In the most common form of factor analysis  the columns of  are orthogonal  i.e. = 0 for  <U+2260>  and the -th column of . Hence  the elements of  are uncorrelated. Moreover  the common factors are assumed to have unit variance  i.e. Var () = . Columns are determined as the corresponding eigenvectors of   scaled by the square root of the respective eigenvalues. However   is not unique and is often subject to an orthogonal transformation to obtain factor loadings which are more interpretable than those derived from the eigenvectors. Finally  the specific effects are assumed to be independently distributed with heterogeneous variances   and  and  are assumed to be uncorrelated. This gives covariance matrix of  under the FA model Var () = = ' +  (6) with  = Diag {} the diagonal matrix of specific variances. This implies that all covariances between the levels of  are due to the common factors  while the specific factors account for the additional variance of individual elements of . For  common factors  this describes the ( + 1)/2 elements of through  =  +  - (-1)/2 parameters  consisting of  specific variances and (2 -  + 1)/2 elements of   with the remaining ( - 1)/2 elements of  determined by the orthogonality constraints. For small   a FA model provides a parsimonious way to model the covariances among a considerable number of variables. As  can not exceed the number of parameters in the unstructured case  ( + 1)/2  the number of common factors that can be fitted is restricted. If all specific variances are non-zero  the minimum number of traits for which imposing a FA structure yields a reduction in the number of parameters is  = 4. A FA structure for the variance of  is most appropriate if all the  traits involved are relatively evenly correlated. In this case  a small number of factors generally suffices to model the covariances among the elements of . The FA model includes many of the commonly employed covariance models for G × E problems as special cases. The simplest scenario is the 'compound symmetry' structure  i.e. S =  +    which is a FA model with a single common factor and  =   (where  denotes a vector with all elements equal to unity) and equal specific variances  for all variables. Jennrich and Schluchter [] proposed a FA structure as an option to model the covariances between repeated records  and typical examples where this is appropriate are the 'same' measurements taken in different circumstances  e.g. different time points for longitudinal data  different locations for G × E problems  or different backgrounds in analyses of QTL or gene expression. In contrast to most random regression type 'reaction norm' models which are often invoked for such analyses  the FA approach does not require a continuous 'control' variable and does not imply smooth changes in the trait. Consider the linear mixed model  =  +  +  (7) with  the vector of observations for  traits     and  vectors of fixed effects  random effects and residuals  and  and  the design matrices pertaining to  and . For simplicity  assume  represents additive genetic effects only for  individuals  with covariance matrix Var () =    and  the numerator relationship matrix (NRM). Further  let Var () = . The corresponding mixed model equations (MME) for a standard  multivariate (MUV) analysis are then The multi-trait framework (8) does not require any assumptions about  other than that it has full rank . If  is represented by a FA structure ( = ' + )  however  an equivalent model to (7) is obtained by fitting the common and specific factors separately []   =  + ( )  +  +  =  +  +  +  (9) with   of length   and   of length   the vectors of common and specific factors  respectively. The corresponding MME are Note that  is considerably denser than   containing  coefficients in each row compared to a single element of unity in . While (10) comprises an additional  equations  the part of the coefficient matrix for random effects is much sparser than for the MUV model  as each element of  contributes only  +  non-zero elements  compared to  in (8). With  diagonal   can have a number of zero elements if there are 'missing' records: the element for trait  and individual  is non-zero only if individual  or one of its relatives has a record for trait . In some contexts  the FA model shown in (9) is referred to as 'extended FA' (XFA) model to distinguish it from the equivalent  multivariate model imposing a FA structure on  (7). For REML estimation of covariance matrices imposing a FA structure  Thompson . [] showed that the sparsity of the MME for the XFA model (10) reduced computational requirements dramatically compared to an implementation utilising the standard multi-trait model (8). A reduced rank model is  in essence  a FA model where specific effects are assumed absent  i.e.  = . This is the model proposed by Kirkpatrick and Meyer [] for parsimonious estimation of genetic covariance matrices. One of the main attractions of the reduced rank model is that it provides a mixed model formulation which allows for genetic covariance matrices that are not of full rank  i.e. it alleviates the need for approximating a reduced rank matrix by a full rank one as required to in the standard MUV implementation (8). In addition  it can result in computational advantages. Assuming  can be modelled through the first  principal components  the MME have less equations than for the corresponding MUV model. Furthermore  the same arguments for increased sparsity of the coefficient matrix apply as given above for the XFA model. This implies that for  =   this parameterisation provides an equivalent model (with  of full rank) to the standard multi-trait model which not only has a sparser coefficient matrix but also involves random effects which are less correlated. This can reduce both the time per iterate and the number of iterates  in particular in genetic evaluation applications relying on indirect solution schemes. Equally  it may provide some computational advantages for analyses involving a direct solution of the MME. In the following  we refer to such models as PC models  to describe both reduced ( <) and full ( = ) rank FA models without specific effects. As emphasized above   is not unique and  for  factors  ( - 1)/2 of the  elements are given by orthogonality constraints. Hence   is frequently subject to an orthogonal rotation  i.e. we can replace  by * =  for an arbitrary orthogonal matrix  without altering the matrix modelled  as ' = *(*)' if  = . Most commonly  this is done for ease of interpretation – widely used  for instance  in social science applications. However  such transformation can also be utilised to reduce computational requirements  or to provide a parameterisation better suited to variance component estimation. For  =  and  =    is a matrix square root of . Let  denote the Cholesky factor of   i.e.  =  with  a lower triangular matrix. The Cholesky factor  is an alternative matrix square root of  and  moreover  can be obtained by rotating : For  =   with  the matrix of eigenvectors of  and  the corresponding  diagonal matrix of eigenvalues  it can be shown that  =   with  the orthogonal matrix of right singular vectors of  [[]  p.232]. This implies that we can replace  in FA models with the  matrix consisting of the first  columns of the Cholesky factor  . For variance component estimation  this substitution is useful as the number of non-zero elements of is equal to the number of parameters to be estimated  e.g. []  and as the Cholesky parameterisation is known to improve convergence rates in maximum likelihood estimation. The triangular nature of  can also be advantageous in genetic evaluation  in particular for G × E scenarios where individuals have records in a single location only: As elements above the diagonal are zero  replacing  with   the rows of  are less dense than for a  with all elements non-zero. Let  denote the -th row of . Assuming the Cholesky factorisation has been carried out sequentially  elements  + 1 to  of  are zero. For an individual with a record in location   vector  represents the coefficients in the respective row of the design matrix . If the individual has a record for a single trait (or environment) only  the contribution to  is   with  the residual variance pertaining to . It is readily seen that only the block consisting of the first  rows and columns of  is non-zero. Hence  the corresponding  diagonal block in the coefficient matrix corresponding to the common factors  has a known sparsity structure  consisting of a dense block  comprising the first  rows and columns  and the remaining  -  rows and columns with all off-diagonal elements equal to zero. For instance  for  = 1 there are no off-diagonal elements  for  = 2 only the first and second row and column are linked by a non-zero off-diagonal element  and only for  =  are all  elements in the diagonal block non-zero. This is readily exploited in both iterative and direct solution schemes. Moreover  for applications with greatly differing numbers of records in different environments  it suggests that numbering environments in decreasing order of the number of records can markedly reduce computational requirements. As shown  if the genetic covariance matrix is adequately modelled by a FA structure  i.e.  = ' +   the standard MUV and the XFA implementation are directly equivalent. In addition  the PC model considering all  factors  i.e. decomposing  =  (with  =  +  the matrix of scaled eigenvectors of  or a rotated form thereof)  provides a third equivalent model. Hence  solutions for effects in the model can be obtained for one model and are readily transformed to those from another. From (7) and (9)  Conversely  as shown by Smith . []  we can obtain solutions for the common and specific factors from those in a standard MUV model Corresponding formulae apply for implementations replacing  by a rotated matrix * such as  and non-equivalent  reduced rank models. Similarly  if estimates of genetic effects for principal components are of interest but a rotated form of  has been used for ease of computation  these are readily obtained by applying a 'backwards' rotation. MUV  PC and XFA models differ greatly in the sparsity of the coefficient matrix in the MME  and the ratio of non-zero off-diagonal elements contributed by the data and the pedigree information. This is illustrated in Figure  which shows the fill pattern for a toy example of data for four countries  with two sires used in each country – a global sire and a local sire – and two progeny per sire. This gives a total of 5 sires and 16 progeny and 21 records  assuming we have records on both sires and progeny (with the global sire allocated to country 1). In addition  the MME contain 4 fixed effects  corresponding to the mean in each country. These are represented by the first 4 equations  followed by the equations for the 5 sires and then the 16 progeny  with horizontal and vertical lines separating the blocks for fixed effects  sires and progeny. . (Non-zero elements arising from data part (red square) and from inverse of relationship matrix (blue square)) For the MUV model  each diagonal block for animals has one element contributed from the data  while each element in the NRM inverse contributes 16 coefficients  resulting in dense diagonal blocks for all animals and a substantial number of off-diagonal elements. This gives 806 non-zero off-diagonal elements or 12.54% filled elements in one triangle (diagonal + off-diagonal) of the symmetric coefficient matrix. The pattern changes substantially when switching to the equivalent PC model fitting all four factors. With factors uncorrelated  each element of the NRM inverse contributes only 4 elements. However  the trade-off is that the design matrix for animal effects is denser  so that there are more contributions from the data part of the MME  i.e. . For an implementation with all elements of   the matrix of factor loadings  non-zero this would contribute a dense diagonal block for each animal. However  rotating  so that elements above the diagonal are zero  this applies only to animals with records in country 4  while the dense blocks for animals with records in other countries are smaller. This is the scenario depicted in part (b) of Figure   with 330 non-zero off-diagonal elements in one triangle of the coefficient matrix and a proportion of fill of 6.46%. Fitting a XFA model  the MME are augmented by the equations for common factors (shown in part (c) of Figure  as the part of the equations with a light gray background  again with separation lines between sires and progeny)  but sparser yet again. With a single record per individual  there are contributions from the data to only one diagonal element for specific factors  and corresponding off-diagonal elements linking this effect to the corresponding common factors. For this parameterisation  there are 246 non-zero off-diagonal elements and the corresponding fill proportion is 4.20%. In a more general scenario  we may have multiple traits recorded in each environment. We could then apply the FA decomposition to the complete  multi-trait and multi-environment genetic covariance matrix. This may be necessary if the traits recorded in different locations are quite diverse (but still similar enough to warrant some FA modelling). In other cases  the same traits are of interest in all locations and their covariance matrices may be sufficiently similar across environments that we can utilise the resulting pattern in modelling the joint matrix more parsimoniously. Most studies on simultaneous modelling of several covariance matrices consider the case of independent groups. Let denote the covariance matrix for the -th group. Simple models suggested include proportionality of matrices  i.e. =  (for  > 1) with the scale factor for group   and the same correlation structure but different variances in different groups  i.e. = with the diagonal matrix of standard deviations for the -th group and  the common correlation matrix []. Other approaches are based on the spectral decomposition of the matrices. Flury [] proposed to model similar covariance matrices through common eigenvectors and specific eigenvalues  i.e. =  with the matrix of eigenvalues for the -th group and  the matrix of common eigenvectors. Later generalisations allowed for partial communality  common subspaces or partial sphericity [  ] and dependent random vectors []. The 'common principal component' approach and resulting hierarchy of models have seen considerable use in the comparison of covariance matrices in evolutionary biology; see Houle . [] for a discussion. Pourahmadi . [] described a corresponding framework based on the Cholesky decomposition. Considering traits measured at different stages of development  Klingenberg . [] modelled all submatrices of a patterned covariance matrix through common principal components  and emphasized not only that  with rearrangement  this resulted in a block-diagonal covariance matrix of the principal components  but also that further structure (such as reduced rank) could be imposed on this matrix. For  traits measured in each of  locations  we have a genetic covariance matrix  with ( + 1)/2 distinct elements. A FA structure could be imposed to this matrix as a whole  as described above. For  factors  this would involve (2 + 1)/2 +  parameters. Assume in the following that traits are ordered within locations  so that  has  submatrices of size  which give the covariances among the  traits measured in locations  and . It is then conceivable that the covariance pattern among traits across locations is sufficiently similar so that = ' with the unitary  lower triangular matrix arising from the generalised Cholesky decomposition of S(S=  with all diagonal elements of equal to unity) and = Diag {}. This implies that pre- and post-multiplication of  with the inverse of  = Diag {} and its transpose simultaneously diagonalises all  submatrices . Let  = {}  i.e.  = .  is ordered according to traits within environments. It is readily seen that by rearranging the rows and columns of  according to environments within traits  we obtain a matrix  which is block-diagonal with  blocks   of size . We can then impose a FA structure on each block in the same way as for the single trait case. Assume   with  the matrix consisting of the first columns of the Cholesky factor of . If we fit a full rank PC model for all   i.e =  and  =  ( = 1  )  and assume all matrices are different   is described by  = ( +  + 2)/2 parameters. If less factors are considered or matrices have some common elements  this is reduced further. For instance  matrices may be the same for some environments  or matrices  may be proportional to each other. In certain cases   is 'separable'  i.e. we are able to decompose  into the direct product of a  matrix   which summarises the covariances between traits  and a  matrix which gives the pattern of correlations between locations and accounts for differences in variability   =  . If a FA structure for is appropriate  this becomes  = ' +    reducing the number of parameters to describe  to  = (( + 1) + (2 + 1))/2 +   or  = (( + 1) + (2 + 1))/2 if = . Smith . [] considered such structure in variance component estimation for sugar cane data. Again  there is further scope to reduce the number of parameters if can be structured as well. Clearly  being able to impose some common structure on the submatrices of  can yield a very parsimonious description of the dispersion structure for multi-trait  multi-environment problems  and this is important for variance component estimation. In terms of solving the MME in genetic evaluation  however  differences depend on the solution scheme employed. Say we are considering a FA model using the Cholesky transform  applied to the unstructured  matrix   and assume that we are fitting a full rank PC model with  = . We would then have an equivalent linear model (see (9) with  =  (  ) and  the Cholesky factor of .  is a dense  lower triangular matrix. Hence contributions to the diagonal block of  for an animal with records in country  would consist of a dense block comprising rows and columns 1 to . This would be the same if the structure considered above were applicable. However   would not be dense  but each  submatrix in the lower triangle would also be a lower triangular matrix. For a solution scheme setting up the MME once and holding them in core  for instance  there would be relatively little advantage of having  with such structure  but for an 'iteration on data' scheme  computational advantages could be substantial. Emphasis in this review has been on modelling and prediction  assuming that the genetic covariance matrix has a FA structure. Closely related are the prerequisite tasks of estimation and model selection  i.e. determining how many factors are required. There is substantial body of literature dealing with these topics  and this section is thus restricted to selected pertinent comments. Most analyses of covariance structures have involved a two-step procedure  first estimating a complete  unstructured covariance matrix and then examining its factors. More recently  direct estimation enforcing a FA structure has been proposed and suitable algorithms for both restricted maximum likelihood (REML) [      ] and Bayesian estimation [] have been described  and mixed model software packages available  such as ASReml [] or WOMBAT []  readily accommodate such analyses. The underlying concept is that only the most important principal components or common factors need to be estimated  while those explaining little variation can be ignored with negligible loss of information. This reduces the number of parameters to be estimated and thus sampling errors. Provided any bias due to the factors that are ignored is relatively small  this is also expected to reduce mean square errors []. Furthermore  eliminating unnecessary parameters is likely to make estimation more stable and efficient. For instance  omitting factors with corresponding eigenvalues close to zero reduces problems associated with estimates at the boundary of the parameter space  and can thus improve convergence rates in iterative estimation schemes. While highly appealing  recent work has identified some unexpected bias in REML estimates of the leading factors in PC models when too few factors are fitted []. Briefly  estimation can 'pick up' a wrong subset of factors. Say we fit  factors. We would then expect our estimates to reflect the first  principal components and any bias in the estimate of  to be due solely due to factors  + 1 to  ignored. However  under certain conditions  one (or more) of the  estimated components can represent one (or some) of the lower ranking factors (with smaller eigenvalues) instead. If this is the case  an analysis fitting  + 1 factors typically yields an estimate of the -th eigenvalue which is larger than that from the analysis fitting  factors  and the trace of the estimated covariance matrix is increased by more than the value of the additional ( + 1-th) eigenvalue estimated. Another indicator is a large angle between the estimates of the -th eigenvector from the two analyses (the dot product of two normalised vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them): if one of the analyses picked up the wrong direction  this is expected to be orthogonal to the true direction  i.e. we expect it to be close to 90°; see Meyer and Kirkpatrick [] for details. This inconsistency in estimators implies that we need to choose  sufficiently large so that all important factors are included  to ensure that we estimate the leading factors correctly. Paradoxically  this can necessitate the inclusion of some factors with negligible eigenvalues. These can omitted subsequently when using the estimated covariance matrix in a genetic evaluation scheme  i.e. the optimal number of factor to be fitted for estimation and prediction is not necessarily the same. The latter could be determined  for instance  based on selection index calculations and the impact of omitting factors with small eigenvalues on the expected accuracy of evaluation []. A number of test criteria to determine the rank of a matrix are available in the literature. Simulation studies examining their utility  however  generally have yielded not very consistent results  both between different tests and in the ability to find the correct dimension (see [] for references). With mixed model based estimation  model selection based on the log likelihood  information criteria or Bayes factors are an obvious choice. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) allowing for the fact that testing an eigenvalue for being different from zero involves a one-sided test at the boundary of the parameter space have been described [  ]. Amemiya and Anderson [] examined likelihood based goodness-of-fit tests for FA models. Akaike [] showed that his information criterion (AIC)  derived in the context of regression models  was also suitable for FA model selection. However  limited simulation studies in a genetic context have found rank selection based on LRT or AIC to be only moderately successful  with substantial underestimates of the true rank for smaller samples for some constellations of population parameters [  ]. Future work is needed to examine reliability of model selection for FA models and in more detail. Mixed model analyses fitting FA models are likely to see increasing use in the future  as higher dimensional analyses considering more than a few traits are becoming more common. This is due to the parsimonious description of covariance structures available  the scope for direct interpretation of factors as well as computational advantages. FA models are most advantageous if all covariances between traits can be attributed to a small number of factors. Focus in this review has been on modelling of the genetic covariance matrix. Corresponding structures may be applicable for covariance matrices due to other random effects. For scenarios where each individual has records in a single environment only  the residual covariance matrix () is (block-)diagonal. If there are non-zero residual covariances  we may wish to impose a structure on  as well. Simultaneous modelling of several matrices  however  should be carried out judiciously  in particular for variance component estimation: Imposing a structure on the genetic covariance matrix can lead to partitioning of some genetic covariances into the residual part. If the structure imposed on the latter then is too restrictive  problematic estimates for the former may result; see [] for a cautionary example. In the context of G × E interactions  separation of genetic effects into common and specific factors is highly appealing  as these factors have an interpretation in their own right. As reviewed above  such models – either ANOVA based or  more recently  employing mixed model methodology – have long been used in the analysis of data from plant breeding trials  and are directly applicable to corresponding problems in animal breeding. For international genetic evaluation  predicted values for common genetic effects of an animal  for instance  could provide global breeding values for that individual. Furthermore  inspection of predictions for the corresponding specific effects could directly reveal its sensitivity to environmental conditions: Similar values for all locations may indicate a good 'all-rounder' while values which are highly variable or are of opposite signs may suggest strong G × E interaction effects. There has been long standing interest in the use of transformations or reparameterisations of various forms to ease the computational burden imposed by large scale genetic evaluation or variance component estimation problems. Earlier  transformations were mostly applied directly to the data  which limited their applicability. In particular  the so-called canonical transformation was found to be extremely useful for multivariate analyses  as it allowed multivariate analyses to be broken into a series of corresponding  univariate analyses. However  this required equal design matrices for all traits and did not allow for additional random effects; see  for instance  Jensen and Mao [] for a review. Hence  sophisticated schemes have been developed to augment the data and to extend the range of applications [  ]. In contrast  FA models involve a reparameterisation of the model  i.e. 'transformations' are applied at the effects level. Thus different design matrices  missing observations or multiple random effects are not an issue. However  the same underlying principles are utilised: computing requirements are reduced by transforming previously correlated effects to be independent and increasing the sparsity of the corresponding MME. Clearly  applicability of FA models depends on the covariance structure among traits or locations being adequately represented by such models. Few studies in animal breeding have addressed this question. Considering genetic correlations for dairy production in 18 countries  Leclerc . [] recommended a FA model with 5 common factors  with an average  absolute deviation in genetic correlations from the unstructured case of 0.014. FA models are often been advocated for their parsimony: for problems of relatively high dimensions  reduced sampling variances due to a greatly reduced number of parameters can easily outweigh small biases due to enforcing such structure but  as emphasized above  we need to ensure that the set of factors fitted includes all important factors. Factor analytic models  which separate genetic effects into common and specific components  provide a natural framework for modelling G × E interaction and related problems. Moreover  they can substantially reduce computational requirements of mixed model analyses compared to standard multivariate models  both in variance component estimation and genetic evaluation schemes.

The main challenge of genomic breeding value estimation is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. Bayesian methods have been proposed to successfully cope with these challenges. As an alternative class of models  non- and semiparametric models were recently introduced. The present study investigated the ability of nonparametric additive regression models to predict genomic breeding values.

The main challenge of genomic breeding value estimation is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. Bayesian methods have been proposed to successfully cope with these challenges. As an alternative class of models  non- and semiparametric models were recently introduced. The present study investigated the ability of nonparametric additive regression models to predict genomic breeding values. The genotypes were modelled for each marker or pair of flanking markers (. the predictors) separately. The nonparametric functions for the predictors were estimated simultaneously using additive model theory  applying a binomial kernel. The optimal degree of smoothing was determined by bootstrapping. A mutation-drift-balance simulation was carried out. The breeding values of the last generation (genotyped) was predicted using data from the next last generation (genotyped and phenotyped). The results show moderate to high accuracies of the predicted breeding values. A determination of predictor specific degree of smoothing increased the accuracy. Genomic selection refers to the use of genomewide dense marker genotypes for breeding value estimation and subsequently for selection. Genomic breeding value estimation relies on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers and QTL and needs genomewide and dense marker data. The main challenge is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. To cope with this problem  Meuwissen . [] proposed Bayesian methods that used informative priors. Meuwissen . [] and Solberg . [] showed by means of simulations that these methods are able to estimate genomic breeding values with a remarkably high accuracy  even for individuals without own phenotypic observations. This offers the opportunity to speed up genetic gain by reducing the need for progeny testing []. Gianola . [] argued that the assumptions made in the Bayesian models of Meuwissen . [] are rather strong (. the priors are very informative) and introduced nonparametric and semiparametric models  which make fewer assumptions. Two ways of modelling the genotypic data are presented by these authors. The first models all genotypes of an individual across the genome simultaneously; see eq. () of Gianola . []. Subsequently  the non- or semiparametric estimate includes additive genetic effects as well as dominance and epistasis. From this total genomic value  an additive breeding value can be extracted by performing linear approximations as shown in eq. () of Gianola . []. In the second way of modelling  the genotypes are modelled for each locus separately  see eq. () of Gianola . []. The authors [] suggest estimating the nonparametric functions of the genotypes of a certain locus by applying additive model theory []. This way of modelling ignores epistatic effects. The total genomic value of an individual is of interest in many cases  favouring the first way of modelling the genotypic data in Gianola . []. For example  one might think of classifying individuals with respect to their liability to a certain disease. In most livestock selection schemes  however  the breeding values  defined as the sum of the additive effects []  are in general the most important. Following this  the second way of modelling the genotypic data in Gianola . []  as described above  seems to be an interesting option  because it yields directly the additive effects  if the genotypes are modelled appropriately  and no extra computational step for the linear approximation is needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of kernel regression using additive models to estimate genomic breeding values. In particular  the modelling of the genotypic data is shown and a method for the optimal selection of model parameters is presented. Using simulations  the accuracy of predicted breeding values from non-phenotyped animals were evaluated. The results were compared to those obtained from the BLUP method for genomic breeding value estimation. Assume that  individuals ( = 1  ...  ) are genotyped at  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( = 1  ...  ). Biallelic SNP are considered. In this case   = 2 different alleles are possible at a SNP ( = 1  ). An allele is coded as 0 or 1 and is denoted by . The individuals are diploid  thus they have two chromosomes ( = 1  2). Further  the individuals are phenotyped for a heritable quantitative trait. The phenotypes are denoted by  and are free of systematic errors. In the additive allelic model  the phenotype of an individual is represented as where is the  th allele of individual  at marker locus  and () is the function value of the  th allele at this locus. is a normally distributed random residual. The conditional expectation function is () = (|)  (2a) The conditional expectation function for any locus  with its alleles can be written in terms of densities [] where () is the density of and can be estimated using a kernel smoother as where  denotes for the kernel and  for a smoothing parameter. In (3)  is the point at which the density is estimated  this is termed the focal point []. The joint density of and  at point ( ) is estimated as Now  it can be shown [. [  ]] that substituting (3) and (4) in (2b) results in the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator [  ] for the conditional expectation function () The additive haplotype model is similar to the allelic model except that haplotypes  formed by pairs of flanked markers  are considered instead of single allelic marker effects. Consequently  the outlines shown above hold  if it is assumed that is the  th haplotype at chromosome segment  of individual  and the first summation in (1) is over  segments. The coding of the haplotypes is done so that  can take  = 4 different values  . 1-1  1-0  0-1  or 0-0. Similarly  the functions of the segments are estimated using the Nadaraya-Watson regression estimator. In the following no distinction is made between the allelic and the haplotype model  unless stated. The loci and segments are both denoted as predictors and the alleles and haplotypes both as levels of the predictors  or short  as levels. The are discrete with only  = 2 ( = 4) different values in the allelic (haplotype) model  see above. Therefore we choose the binomial kernel of Aitchison and Aitken []. Using this kernel  for each focal and each observed the number of disagreements  is estimated. In the allelic model  takes values of 0 (is 0 and is 0) or 1 (is 0 and is 1)  and in the haplotype model values of 0 (is 1-1 and is 1-1)  1 (is 1-1 and is 1-0 or 0-1) or 2 (is 1-1 and is 0-0). Using this definition of   the binomial kernel  is where  is the smoothing parameter with  =  = 1 []. The Nadaraya-Watson regression applying the binomial kernel for the estimation of the functions is Extending (2a) to account for multiple predictors  the conditional expectation function can be written as Assuming additivity of the predictors  this leads to the following iterative backfitting algorithm [  ] for computing the functions. 1.     (). 2.   ; () = NWR( | ().  (). 3. . In step one the nonparametric function values are initialised with some small numbers. Step two comprises the application of the Nadaraya-Watson regression (denoted by NWR) in the form described in (5)  but using ( | ) instead of . The term ( | ) is called the partial residual and denotes for the phenotypes corrected for every predictor except for the level  of individual  at predictor . The collinearities result in a non-uniqueness of the estimates []. Therefore  () are centred in the second step by subtracting the mean of fitted function values to the 2 chromosomes at the predictor . This centring ensures that the overall mean of the fitted function values is zero at every cycle of the backfitting and the algorithm converges to one possible solution []. It might be noted that the backfitting algorithm is very similar to the Gauss-Seidel algorithm  further details can be found in []. In applying kernel regression  one key question is which value for the smoothing parameter  should be used. As stated above  when a binomial kernel is applied  the lower and upper bound of  is 0.5 and 1  respectively. When  = 1 the whole weight of (    ) is concentrated at = and () in (3) is just the proportion of cases was observed in the sample. On the contrary  when  = 0.5  the degree of smoothing is at maximum and (    ) gives the same weight to each of the [  ]. One way of selecting an appropriate  is to apply bootstrapping as follows []. Assume a number of  bootstrap samples ( = 1  ...  ). In each   the data points are split into two sets. The first set  denoted as the estimation set  is formed by the entire bootstrap sample and the second  denoted as the test set  is formed by the individuals not found in the corresponding bootstrap sample. Since a bootstrap sample is generated by drawing  observations out of the original pool of  observations with replacement []  the probability of any given progeny being chosen after  drawings is [1-[1-1/]] ˜ 0.632 and the probability not being chosen  and consequently forming the test set  is [1-1/]˜ e ˜ 0.368. For each individual an indicator variable is introduced  this is 1 if the individual is present in the test set of the corresponding bootstrap sample   and 0 otherwise (= 1 and = 0  respectively). For a grid of  and each bootstrap sample   the functions of each predictor  are estimated as described above using the corresponding estimation set of each . This results in  different . The average residual sums of squares of each individual is calculated as This means that only those bootstrap samples are considered where the corresponding individual  was not in the estimation set  but in the test set. Averaging over all individuals yields Note that the subscript  denotes for the individual. The   which produced the smallest   can be chosen to analyse the original sample. This method is termed the equal lambda method (ELM) in the following  because the  takes the same value for each predictor. Different  might be optimal for different predictors and a predictor specific determination of  is desirable. In principle  the bootstrap strategy can be expanded accordingly. However  this would need  times  times the number of  in the grid calculations  which is computationally not feasible. Additionally  the constellation  which results in the smallest  might be difficult to find. In previous analysis we investigated the optimal degree of smoothing for predictors taking the knowledge of the simulated QTL into account. The degree of smoothing was less for predictors in LD with a QTL compared to predictors not in LD with a QTL. Additionally  predictors that showed a similar variance of their function values  also showed a similar optimal . This lead to the following algorithm for the group-wise predictor specific  determination  subsequently named unequal lambda method (ULM). 1. Determine one  valid for all predictors using ELM. 2. Estimate the variance of the  function values for each predictor ( = 2 in the allelic and  = 4 in the haplotype model  see above). 3. Select those  ( = 5) predictors which show the highest variance and determine an optimal  for them using bootstrapping  but letting the lower bound of  be as determined in ELM. The  for the remaining predictors are fixed at the determined value from ELM. 4. Repeat step 3 for the next set of  predictors  which show the next highest variance. Here  keep  for the remaining predictors fixed at their determined value  . from ELM for predictors with a lower variance  and from step (3) otherwise. 5. Repeat step 4 until all predictors are passed. Finally  the original sample is analysed with the group-wise predictor specific . The BLUP model of Meuwissen . [] can be applied in an allelic model or in a haplotype model. For simplicity only the allelic BLUP model will be considered in the following. In Meuwissen . [] it is assumed that the variance of a marker effect is /(2)  with  being the additive genetic variance. Note that each marker affects the phenotype two times  via the paternal and the maternal allele  hence the  in the denominator. If the unequal gene frequencies at the markers are taken into account  the variance of a marker effect becomes /(4)  with  being the average heterozygosity across markers. The derivation is given in the Appendix 1  and can also be found in Habier . [] using a different approach. If  equals 0.5 (. the allele frequency at every marker is 0.5)  the expression reduces to /(2). In order to test the ability of the additive nonparametric regression models to predict reliable breeding values  and to compare the results from those obtained from BLUP  a simulation study was conducted. The simulations were performed as described by Solberg . []. Briefly  a population was simulated over 1000 generations with mutations and random selection and mating with an effective population size of 100. Ten chromosomes each of 100 cM length and each with 100 potential QTL evenly distributed over the chromosome were generated. The number of segregating QTL depended on the mutation rate at the QTL  which was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 []. For each mutation at the QTL an additive effect was sampled from the gamma distribution with a shape and a scale parameter of 1.66 and 0.4  respectively []. This implied that many QTL had small and only few had large effects. QTL effects were sampled such that they had equal probability of positive or negative effects. QTL effects were simulated to be additive. The marker density was 1 cM  0.5 cM or 0.25 cM. The mutation rate at the markers was assumed to be 2.5 × 10 []. Markers showed in general multiple alleles. In order to reflect SNP markers  they were converted to biallelic markers by assuming that only one of the mutations was visible as described by Solberg . []. The proportion of segregating SNPs (segregating QTL) was around 98% (5–6%) of the number of simulated markers (QTL) at generation 1000. In generation 1001  the number of animals was increased to 1000 by factorial mating. The LD of pairs of segregating markers was estimated as  value in generation 1001. The average  of two adjacent segregating markers was 0.158  0.222  and 0.295 for the marker density 1 cM  0.5 cM and 0.25 cM  respectively []. The animals in generation 1001 produced 1000 offspring for generation 1002 by random mating. Animals in generation 1001 and 1002 were genotyped at the SNP markers and animals in generation 1001 were also phenotyped. The phenotypes were the sum of their simulated breeding value and a random deviation e (e ~ N(0  )).  was chosen such that the heritability of the trait was h = 0.25 or h = 0.5. For the haplotype model  the simulated haplotypes were used (no extra haplotype determination was performed). The number of replicates was 10 for each marker density and each h. In the additive nonparametric regression  the functions were estimated using the data from the generation 1001. These were used to predict the breeding values () of the generation 1002 as The smoothing parameter  was varied as  = 0.5  0.525  .... A total of  = 50 bootstrap samples were generated. For ULM  the groups size for the group-wise predictor specific  determination was  = 5  10 and 20 for a marker density of 1 cM  0.5 cM and 0.25 cM  respectively. The convergence criterion to exit the backfitting algorithm was an average change of the function values of two consecutive iterations below 2.5 * 10. A relaxation factor [. []] of 0.7 was included. Additionally  generation 1001 was analysed using the BLUP model described above  assuming the variance of the effects of each marker is /(4) and using the simulated variance components. The BLUP system of equations was solved iteratively by applying the Gauss-Seidel algorithm [. []]. The same convergence criterion as for the nonparametric additive model was used. Also these estimates were used to predict the breeding values of generation 1002. The correlation between the true breeding value and the  of the individuals in generation 1002 as well as the regression coefficient of the  on the  was estimated  which served as empirical measures of the ability of the methods to predict accurate and unbiased breeding values of individuals without own phenotypic observations []. Unbiased means here (|) =   and a regression coefficient below one (above one) indicates that the  vary too much (too little). Unbiased EBV are important if selection has to be carried out from multiple generations using estimated marker effects in one generation. Assume selection will be done across two-year classes  where the marker effects are estimated in the older year class only. Further assume that the younger year class is in general superior (. has a higher population mean) due to selection response. If the  vary too much (too little) then too many animals will be selected from the older (younger) year class. The results are shown in Tables  and . Summarized over all genetic configurations analyzed  the accuracies of  obtained from ULM were highest. However  these were also most biased  as indicated by the in general lower regression coefficients. The accuracies from ELM and BLUP were very similar. The impact of the heritability can be seen when comparing the results reported in Table  with those in Table . As expected  the accuracies of the  were higher for a heritability of 0.5. Additionally  the  were in general less biased for the higher heritability. This was most obvious for ULM. Increasing marker density led to higher accuracies of  for all methods. With increasing marker density the regression coefficient of the true on the estimated breeding value decreased for ELM and ULM  resulting in general in an increased bias with increasing marker density. One exception is for ELM and a marker density of 1 cM  where the  vary too little. Here  the bias decreased when moving to a marker density of 0.5 cM (see second row of Tables  and ). In contrast  with increasing marker density the regression increased for BLUP. The differences between the allelic and the haplotype model were small  regardless of the method used (Tables  and ). The haplotype model produced slightly better results in low marker density situations  but with dense markers the accuracies from the allelic and the haplotype model were very similar. The same was reported for the BayesB method [  ]. The computational demand was in an increasing order: BLUP  ELM and ULM. For example  one replicate with a marker density of 1 cM analysed with the allelic model took below one minute when using BLUP  around one hour for ELM and several hours for ULM. The reason is  that ELM and ULM included bootstrapping to determine the optimal . Naturally  the computation time would even be higher if the number of bootstrap samples () would be larger. It seems that  = 50 is at the lower bound when comparing with literature reports []. However  increasing  did not produce significantly different results (not shown)  indicating that  = 50 was sufficient here. The time to reach convergence depended on  and the marker density. With increasing  and increasing marker density more iteration were needed until convergence was reached. For example  in general the number of iterations for  = 0.6 was ~15 and for  = 0.9 was ~50 for a marker density of 1 cM. The same figures for a marker density of 0.25 cM were ~20 and ~90  respectively. Figure  and  showed that during the grid search for the optimal   the accuracy increased with increasing  monotonically and decreased monotonically after the optimum  was passed. Therefore  in order to speed up computations  the grid was started at the lower bound of  and was ended when the  from (7a) and (7b) stopped decreasing  assuming that the optimal  was reached or is not far away. The start at the lower bound was because convergence is reached fast if  is small (see above). Additionally  if  failed to decrease due to some random sampling before the optimal  was reached  this would result in an over-smoothing  and hence  the results would be conservative. . Correlation () between the true and the estimated breeding values (top) and regression () of the true on the estimated breeding values (bottom) as a function of smoothing parameter (lambda) and the marker density. The same lambda was applied to all markers. The heritability was 0.5 and marker density was 1 cM (black square)  0.5 cM (black diamond)  and 0.25 cM (black triangle)  respectively. Average from 10 replicates. . Correlation () between the true and the estimated breeding values (top) and regression () of the true on the estimated breeding values (bottom) as a function of smoothing parameter (lambda) and the marker density. The same lambda was applied to all chromosomal segments. The heritability was 0.5 and marker density was 1 cM (black square)  0.5 cM (black diamond)  and 0.25 cM (black triangle)  respectively. Average from 10 replicates. For ULM the numbers of predictors with a  within a defined bin are shown in Tables  and . A higher marker density results in more predictors that are less smoothed  . showing a  closer to one. This is due to the higher number of predictors in LD with the QTL. Also  with an increased heritability more predictors are less smoothed (top and bottom of Tables  and ). The grid search for finding the optimal  is more powerful in high heritability situations  leading to this lesser degree of smoothing. Additionally  as for ELM  more smoothing is done in the haplotype model than in the allelic model. This can be seen in the higher number of predictors showing a  > 0.9 in the allelic model (Table  and ). As stated in the introduction  in genomic breeding value estimation we are faced with the problem of estimating many effects from a limited number of observations  and  additionally  many effects show collinearities due to the LD between the SNPs. The BLUP model overcomes these problems by treating the predictors as random variables and estimating them simultaneously. In the nonparametric kernel regressions (ELM and ULM)  the numerous effects are estimable by smoothing the phenotypes against one predictor at a time  assuming that the effects of the remaining are removed from the phenotypes. Of course  the true effects of the remaining predictors are unknown and have to be estimated themselves  resulting in the iterative backfitting algorithm []. Nuisance factors can be included in the algorithm and can be estimated parametrically using least squares. The model is then semiparametric and the backfitting algorithm iterates between the parametric (. estimating the effects of the nuisance factors by least squares) and the nonparametric part (. estimating the SNP function values by the Nadaraya-Watson regression)  without changing the general structure of the algorithm []. Using kernel regression  the choice of the appropriate degree of smoothing is important  which depends on the sample size. Naturally  if the sample size grows to infinity  smoothing is almost not required [] and hence  should be close to 1. However  sample size is never infinite  and  therefore   has to be chosen carefully  taking the sample size into account. Indeed  in ELM the optimal  for a marker density of 1 cM  a heritability of 0.5 and applying the allelic model is 0.74 (Figure ). If the size of the data set would only be 500  the optimal  would be 0.65 (not shown elsewhere). The applied bootstrap strategy takes the sample size into account  because the estimation set is of equal size as the full data set. In ELM the  determined by bootstrapping was very close to the optimal . This can be seen by comparing the results reported in Table  for the ELM with the maximum achievable accuracies shown in Figures  and . Alternatively  leave-one-out cross validation is suggested [  ]. Using this method  for a given   the functions are fitted using all but one observation and then the prediction error of this observation is calculated given the fitted functions. This is repeated for all observations. The   which produces the lowest average prediction error  is chosen to be the optimal . However  this strategy would require running  times the analysis  which would computationally be too demanding in the present data sets. The bootstrap as applied in this study is related to this cross-validation strategy  see [] for a detailed discussion. When nuisance factors are included in the model and the number of data points in some classes is very low  it might happen that in some bootstrap samples these effects are not estimable or estimated poorly. One obvious solution is to use only those bootstrap samples where the number of data points in each class is above a defined threshold. Since it is assumed that the nuisance effects and the SNP effects are independent  this would not affect the results regarding the choice of the appropriate . From Figures  and  it can be seen that the regression coefficient was on average highest when the degree of smoothing was at maximum and decreased monotonically with a decrease of the degree of smoothing (higher )  as expected. The crossing point of the regression plots with one (. the unbiased estimation point) shown in the bottom of these figures coincided with the maximum accuracy (top of the figures). The plot of the accuracy against  did not show a pronounced maximum. Hence  ELM was not very sensitive with regard to the choice of . The optimal  depended on the marker density. With increasing density  more smoothing (. a lower ) was required. This is because the QTL effects are represented by all SNPs that are in LD with it. With an increasing number of SNP being in LD with the QTL  each SNP captures a smaller part of the QTL effect  and hence  requires more smoothing. Naturally  the number of SNP in LD with the QTL is higher in high marker density situations. Additionally  with increasing number of SNP  more SNP show by chance spurious effects  and hence  more smoothing is required to minimise the impact of these spurious effects. In this study the markers were equally distributed across the chromosomes. In practise it might happen that this is not the case and some QTL are in LD with many markers (requires more smoothing) whereas others only with few markers (requires less smoothing). It can be assumed that ULM might cope with unequal marker densities better than ELM and BLUP  because of the group-wise specific  estimation. The results from the allelic BLUP and the allelic ELM are very similar (Tables  and ). This might be intuitively surprising  because of the different assumptions underlying these models. However  we compared both models formally and found close similarities between them  leading to the similar results. For details see Appendix 2. BLUP needs estimates of variance components whereas ELM needs a . For additive genetic variances reliable estimates of variance components are usual available  . from REML analysis. However  this is in general not the case for nonadditive genetic variance components like dominance or epistasis. As reviewed by Thaller . []  dominance QTL effects are not negligible. The nonparametric regression models allow the inclusion of dominance effects without having knowledge of the dominance variance component. A simulation study could show the benefit of taking dominance into account. However  for a realistic simulation knowledge of the distribution of QTL dominance effects is needed. This is largely unknown up to now. More research is needed in this field. Meuwissen . [] stated that the main disadvantage of BLUP is the assumption that every predictor is associated with the same genetic variance leading to a too strong regression of large QTL  which limits the accuracies of the . The same holds true for ELM  where the degree of smoothing is too strong for predictors linked to large QTL. ULM overcomes the problem of too strong smoothing of predictors with large QTL by building groups of  predictors showing similar variance of their function values and determining different  for each group. Hence it is assumed that predictors that show a large variance are linked to large QTL. Indeed  in ULM the amount of smoothing is substantially reduced for many predictors (Tables  and )  resulting in the higher accuracies of the  estimated by ULM (Tables  and ). The standard deviations in Tables  and  are high for  > 0.7. This might be due to the difficulty in finding the optimal  and additionally due to the unequal distribution of the simulated QTL effects. As described above  these followed gamma distribution with a high density for small and a low density for large effects []. Hence  some replicates might show several big QTL resulting in more predictors with a large  whereas other replicates might show only small or medium sized QTL and the number of predictors with a  close to one is small in these replicates as well. In ULM a critical question is how large the group size () should be. If  is too small ( = 1 or 2) then only those predictors which are linked to very large QTL would receive a  above that determined by ELM  because only these might be able to decrease the  during the grid search of . In contrast  if  is too large ( = 100 or 200)  then many predictors containing only small QTL would receive a too large   because they are in a group with predictors with large QTL. Both situations would result in less accurate estimates. It seems that the group size chosen in this study ( in between 5 and 20  depending on the marker density) is an appropriate choice. The algorithm defining the group-wise  was stopped when all predictors have passed it one time (see end of section 2.2). Alternatively the algorithm could have been repeated several times with updated  and stopped when the  did not change anymore  which would be  however  computationally very demanding. It may be possible to estimate  by the use of a prior distribution in ULM. One possibility for such a procedure would be to sample  from a mixture of two distributions  one for predictors in LD with a QTL and the second component of the mixture for predictors not associated with a QTL. The latter distribution would put significantly more  if not all  probability mass at  equal to 0.5 (smoothing is at maximum)  whereas the first one would support less smoothing. However  as the models were implemented in this study  they do not use any prior information  in contrast to BayesB of Meuwissen . []. A comparison of the results presented in Table  with those of Solberg . []  who simulated the same genetic configuration but applied BayesB  suggests that the accuracy of ULM is lower compared to the accuracies of BayesB in the allelic case. Nonparametric additive regression models for genomic breeding value estimation were shown to estimate breeding values of individuals without phenotypic information with moderate to high accuracy. The optimal degree of smoothing was determined either for all predictors jointly (ELM) or for groups of predictors separately (ULM). The latter increased the accuracies of the . The accuracies of the superior model  the ULM model  are in general slightly lower compared to BayesB. The behaviour of these models for the estimation of genomic breeding values considering also dominance QTL effects remains to be investigated.

This appendix shows the close similarity of the allelic BLUP model and the allelic nonparametric regression model using a single smoothing factor () in eq (5) of the main text. A haploid model is assumed for simplicity of notation  but the extension to two alleles per marker is straightforward. Denote the number of times allele M1 (M2) at a marker M is observed in the sample as (). The frequencies of M1 and M2 are  and 1-. The mean of the phenotypes associated with M1 (M2) is .

The weights  and  depend on the variance component    gene frequencies  and and . The BLUP estimate of the M2 effect can be derived in the same way. According to eq (5) of the main text  the nonparametric function value of M1 can be written as with As shown in the main text  in the allelic model  equals 2 and  can take the values 0 or 1  depending on the number of disagreements between the focal (M1) and the observed allele and therefore can take only two values   () for phenotypes associated with M1 (M2). Following this  (A3) results in where and denote for the phenotypes associated with M1 and M2  respectively. This can be written as with  +  = 1 and both weights are nonnegative.

Eq (A5) has the same form as (A2)  hence by choosing  appropriately  such that the weights  and  are similar or the same in BLUP and in the nonparametric regression  both models became similar or the same. If one  is used across all loci  it becomes impossible to choose a  such that the weights  and  are equal for both models for all loci. It may however be possible to choose  such that these weights are very similar. Meuwissen THE  Hayes BJ  Goddard ME: Prediction of total genetic value using genome-wide dense marker maps.

Preventive measures and lost production due to endemic disease form an important component of the costs of production in many livestock production systems []  and they also affect animal welfare and marketability of breeding stock. It is well known that  for many diseases  resistance has a genetic component [] and selection for disease resistance has long been considered a promising way to reduce disease prevalence . []. Selection for resistance to an infectious disease has the added benefit that it may reduce the pathogen burden  especially when the population under selection is the main reservoir of pathogens. This will lead to an additional reduction in prevalence  in addition to the direct genetic effect  as a result of reduced contamination from infectious animals  . []. The phenotype used in selection for disease resistance is often a score  which includes a class of healthy animals  and one or more classes of affected animals. In the case of endemic diseases the vast majority of animals at any one time may be classified as healthy  and this limits the opportunity for intense selection. In a threshold model  that is appropriate for this type of data  prevalences that are much lower than 50% also lead to low heritabilities on the observed scale. A successful selection programme can therefore be expected to decrease the subsequent response to selection through increased resistance and decreased pathogen burden. Anderson and May [] describe the spread of a microparasitic (viral or bacterial) infection through a population of animals using a so-called SIR model  based on the rates at which susceptible () animals are infected () and then recover or are removed (). A key parameter is   which is the number of secondary infections caused by the first infected animal. One or more of these rates can be under genetic control and hence affect . This model can be extended in various ways; for instance Bishop and MacKenzie [] have described how a disease that is spread from animal to animal may or may not lead to an epidemic  and Nath . [] have explored the consequences of selection to alter different model parameters. To make these models more applicable to typical livestock bacterial infections  Bishop . [] have considered a disease in which the pathogen survives for some time in the environment () from where it can infect susceptible animals. This was termed a SEIR model. In the above models  the assumption is that recovered animals are no longer susceptible to the disease  and in a closed population without re-infection these models will therefore always lead to zero prevalence  either because there are no susceptible animals left or because the disease has died out. This outcome is inappropriate for typical endemic diseases  which often have a more or less stable prevalence over time. This stable prevalence  the endemic equilibrium  may be due to recovered animals losing their resistance and becoming susceptible again  or it may simply be a consequence of a continued introduction of new susceptible animals  . offspring. Building on the SEIR model []  we introduce two new aspects to the model: (i) a period of latency () in which animals are infected but not yet infectious and (ii) loss of immunity so that recovered () animals can revert back to susceptible. This creates a SELIRS model. Further  we consider the SELDCRS model in which animals can be diseased and infectious () or a carrier  which is infectious but no longer clinically diseased (). This model can be used to distinguish direct effects related to the number of diseased animals from indirect effects related to pathogen burden  by manipulating relative rates associated with  and . Footrot is an infectious disease of sheep caused by bacteria () that survive in soil for a limited time. The prevalence in adult sheep in Britain is around 6% []. Resistance to footrot has been shown to be heritable [–]  and selection for increased resistance is feasible. The aim of this study was to develop SELIRS and SELDCRS epidemic models  in which pathogens survive in the environment for a limited time. The models were applied to footrot in sheep and used to predict the changes in prevalence of footrot over time if selection is for resistance to the disease  accounting for the disease dynamics. The predicted progress in terms of reduction in prevalence was compared with a model that ignores epidemiological effects. An overview of all symbols and abbreviations used and their definitions is given in Table . Consider a population of  individuals which  at time   consists of  susceptible   latently infected   infected and  recovered animals. It is assumed that it is only category  animals that show clinical signs of disease and are infectious. Environmental contamination is quantified by the concept of an infectious dose; therefore at time  there are  infectious doses of the pathogen in the environment. Following Bishop .  []  and approximating the discrete process (. daily steps) by a continuous one  the SELIRS model is defined by the following five differential equations:  = -+. (1) / = --. (2)  = -. (3)  = -. (4)  = -. (5) where  is the rate at which susceptible animals become infected (latent) per infectious dose   is the rate of loss of immunity   is the rate at which latent animals develop clinical signs and become infectious   is the rate at which infectious doses are shed by infected animals   is the rate at which infectious doses die (other than by host animals)   is the rate at which a host animal physically removes infectious doses (. by ingestion  adherence to the animal or squashing them) and  is the rate at which infectious animals become immune. All rates are non-negative. Two properties of this model are of importance  the notional reproductive rate () and the equilibrium prevalence. In standard epidemiological models the basic reproductive ratio    is the number of infections caused by a single infected animal in a wholly susceptible population  during the course of its infectious period. The equivalent in the SELIRS model is the number of secondary infections due to a single infectious animal  for the time period over which the infectious material remains in the environment. Bishop . [] have derived an expression for the notional reproductive rate in a SEIR model as: where  =  +   . the total rate at which the infection is removed from the environment. The same expression may be used as an approximation to  in an SELIRS model (see Appendix 1)  however it is not exact as the loss of immunity potentially increases the number of secondary infections in situations where the environmental contamination is long-lived and the period of immunity is short. An equilibrium state will be reached when the number of animals in each state is the same from one day to the next. In other words  the rates of change for the numbers of each category of animal (equations 1  3  4  5) are all zero  . d/d = d/d = d/d = d/d = 0. It can be shown (see Appendix 1) that the corresponding equilibrium number of diseased and infectious animals (*) is: Combined with (6)  it follows that the equilibrium prevalence ()  */  is Hence  after rearrangement   may be defined as a function of the equilibrium prevalence as follows: Note that in equation ()  (infection shedding rate from animal) and  (infection rate) occur as the product  indicating that the rate of infection depends jointly on the number of infective units spread by infected animals and the number of units required for an animal to become infected. This means that there is no need for an exact definition of the infective dose. In many instances animals may be infectious  even when no clinical signs of disease are apparent  a phenomenon in some circumstances referred to as 'carrier status'. Defining clinical disease and infectious status as two separate but overlapping categories also allows greater flexibility in the exploration of the disease dynamics. This is achieved in the SELDCRS model  in which animals can be diseased and infectious () or infectious carriers who no longer show clinical signs ()  with  = . Equations (1) and (3) describing change in  and  remain the same  with the remaining equations being:  = (+)-. (10)  = -. (11)  = -. (12)  = -. (13) Where the new symbols are:  is the rate at which diseased animals no longer show clinical signs and move to the carrier state  and  is the rate at which carrier state animals cease to be infectious. The total time an animal is infectious is 1/+1/  rather than simply 1/ as in the SELIRS model. This accounts for the supposition that infected animals may stop showing clinical signs yet continue to be infectious  rather than assuming that only animals with clinical signs are infectious. For the SELIRS and SELDCRS models to be equivalent in terms of transmission of infection then the total infectious period must be the same in both models  . 1/ = (1/+1/). Note that this is proposed solely as a theoretical tool to distinguish between the effects of recovery on the animal it self (clinical signs) and on the population (infectious)  which are confounded in the SELDIRS model. It is not proposed as a selection strategy. Table  shows a contrast of similar parameters in the SELIRS and SELDCRS models. For purposes of comparing the SELDCRS model with quantitative genetic models that ignore the transmission of infection (see below)  the pathogen burden () in the population can be made independent of changes in the rate at which diseased animals apparently recover () if any reductions in the number of diseased animals () are compensated by an increase in the number of carriers ()  . the total time that an animal is infectious (1/+1/) is kept constant. Properties of the SELDCRS model are derived in Appendix 1  with R'  the reproductive rate of the disease  being defined as: and the equilibrium prevalence p*  being defined as: Equation () can alternatively be written as: There are two differences between the equations defining equilibrium prevalence in the SELIRS and SELDCRS models (equations 8 and 15). First  if the assumption is invoked that the total infectious period is kept constant  then with decreasing 1/ the term  is constant in SELDCRS but will decrease with decreasing 1/ in SELIRS. Secondly  under the same assumption of constant infectious period  inspection of equations  and  reveals that the SELDCRS model will lead to the lower equilibrium prevalence  given the same values for all other parameters. The equilibrium prevalence will be relatively insensitive to change in  if it has a high value (. not close to 1). Improvement of resistance to disease by genetic selection in its simplest form  . disregarding information from relatives  consists of selection of those animals that do not show clinical signs at the time point at which the observations are made. The expected response to selection on such a binary trait depends on the heritability of resistance and the prevalence. This can be calculated assuming a threshold ('all or none') model with an underlying normally distributed liability with heritability   which depends on the heritability of the binary trait () as:  = (1 - )  (17) where  is the prevalence of the binary trait and  is the ordinate of the standardised normal distribution corresponding to  []. For the case where the number of healthy animals available for breeding exceeds the number required for selection  and again disregarding information from relatives  the response to selection is calculated as if the selected proportion is equal to 1-  and on the underlying scale the response is  =  with  the selection intensity corresponding to 1-. Because of reductions in prevalence  the response to selection is not linear but decreases with increasing values of 1-. In the context of the disease dynamics  selection for 'healthy' animals may be thought of as selection on one or more of the following: a. The recovery rate  or  (. infectious or diseased animals recover quicker  . due to an acquired immune response) b. The susceptibility of animals  (. susceptible animals are more resistant to infection   requiring exposure to a greater number of infectious doses before becoming infected) c. The rate of shedding of bacteria  (. infectious animals spread fewer bacteria) – this is comparable to selection for reduced egg counts with nematode infections d. The rate at which immunity is lost  (. longer lasting immunity) e. The rate at which latently infected animals become infectious  (. longer latency  as seen in scrapie). Note that  and  occur only as products in  and *  therefore their effects can be considered jointly in this model. In the simplest analogy to the threshold model  one can think of the model parameters  particularly  and  (. recovery rate) or  (susceptibility) as being analogous to the liability  with heritable between-animal variation. This being the case  we can then assume that the liability and one or more of these parameters have the same distribution and heritability  and responses to selection can be calibrated between the threshold model and the SELIRS or SELDCRS models. Note that because of (6) selection on  (or ) is equivalent to selection on   given a constant . The response to selection for a binary disease trait can now be estimated in two ways; based on the threshold model and on the SELIRS or SELDCRS model. The threshold model is fully described by the prevalence and heritability of resistance  but the epidemiological models require a greater number of parameters. While estimates for most are available  prediction of the response to selection also requires knowledge of variation in the parameter under selection. One way to approach this is to parameterise the threshold model and the epidemiological models so that (for example) they give the same predicted response to one round of selection  and then study the longer-term predicted selection responses from these models. In the threshold model  the response to selection on the observed scale is equal to the change in prevalence -  with  being the prevalence predicted in the threshold model after one round of selection. For the epidemiological model to predict the same response to selection we use the standard selection response equation  =  *- *  so that  = ( *- *)/  (18) with  being the implied phenotypic standard deviation of the trait under selection. This standard deviation can now be used for parameters in the SELIRS and SELDCRS models  in order to calibrate selection responses. Some properties of responses to selection for these models and their dependence on various parameters are derived in Appendix 1. If selection is on 1/  or one of its animal-components other than    or   and assuming that 1/ is normally distributed  the phenotypic standard deviation  that leads to the same response to one round of selection in the SELIRS model as the threshold model (-) can be calculated (see Appendix 1) as To apply the SELIRS and SELDCRS models to footrot and predict likely effects of selection  parameters were chosen based on literature estimates of the length of time (in days) that each phase lasts  as shown in Table . Note that  by definition  the required rates are the inverse of the length of time. To investigate the consequences of a range of values for  and   the *   and  were set at 0.08  0.0333 day and 0.1667 day respectively  and  varied from 0.025  0.1  0.2 to 0.3 dayso that corresponding values for  were 1.18  1.58  2.91 and 18.08. Extreme values were investigated with  = 20   = 0.025 day and  = 0.5. To investigate the predicted response to selection in the various models and parameter combinations  the equilibrium prevalence of footrot was calculated over 20 rounds of selection on 1/ and 1/ in the SELDCRS and SELIRS models  using discrete generations and a heritability of 0.3  assuming a normal distribution for 1/  1/ and 1/ with constant underlying variances and ignoring the Bulmer effect (whereby genetic variation is reduced as a consequence of selection). With the initial prevalence of footrot set at 0.08  the response to one round of selection using a threshold model was calculated to estimate  according to (16) and (17). Then (14) and (8) were used to estimate  given the other parameters. Changes in the parameter under selection (1/  1/ or 1/) that would result from selection of a random sample of healthy animals were calculated for each generation and the new value inserted in (14) or (8) as appropriate to obtain the equilibrium prevalence in the next generation. Predicted responses to selection according to the SELDCRS model with selection on 1/ (the time an animal is diseased and infectious) and the SELIRS model with selection on 1/ are identical for values of  = 0.2 and  = 2.91 (Fig. ). Both responses are larger than the threshold model prediction after the first round (when they were fixed at the same value). This is the result of differences in the relationship between the trait under selection and prevalence which is close to linear for SELIRS and SELDCRS but not for the threshold model. As expected  the SELIRS model predicts a significant additional response from selection on 1/ compared to the SELDCRS model  in which the total infection period is held constant in this parameterisation. All graphs have a similar shape  showing diminishing returns at lower prevalences. . The notional reproductive rate   or the recovery rate  or  is the trait under selection; initial values are  = 2.91   =  = 0.2   = 0.0333   = 0.1667   = 0.08 and  = 0.3; the response is standardised to the same genetic response after one generation of selection  the SELIRS model with selection on  shows an additional epidemiological effect. A value of  of just greater than 1 leads to predicted prevalence of footrot quickly going to 0 (Fig. ). The reason is that  drops below 1  so that the infection is not expected to be maintained in the population. In contrast  very high values of  (such as 18) do not lead to a noticeable additional predicted response. With typical values for  for footrot of about 1.5 an additional response in prevalence of over 2% of animals can be expected after a few generations  but this difference decreases again in later generations.    . Selection is on   with  = 0.0333   = 0.1667   = 0.08 and  = 0.3. For more extreme cases  with  and * large and  small  a different picture emerges with the SELIRS model actually predicting a lower response to selection for larger  in early generations than SELDCRS or selection on  (Fig. ). This is because the variation in 1/ is relatively small and changes have little effect on .              . Additional calculations (results not shown) have confirmed that the predicted response to selection on  or  does not depend on values of the rate at which latently-affected animals become infectious () or the rate at which recovered animals lose immunity ()  given    and . A model was developed to predict the response to selection for resistance to an endemic bacterial disease  and this model was then applied to footrot in sheep. While the exact description of the epidemiological process requires a great number of parameters  many of which are poorly known  the prediction of relative responses to selection depends on only a few parameters. By using the threshold model to predict the response to one round of selection  and setting this as the standard  the only epidemiological parameters required are the rate at which animals recover () and the reproductive rate ()  alongside the heritability of resistance to the disease (or the parameter under selection). It was shown that if the notional reproductive rate  is under selection  changes in the prevalence are proportional to changes in 1/. If selection is for larger  (. quicker recovery) the SELIRS model predicts a response that consists of the direct effect of animals recovering more quickly  plus an additional component arising from the resulting lower pathogen burden. It seems counterintuitive that there is no such additional 'epidemiological' component from selection on   especially since selection on  may in fact be on the susceptibility to infection as denoted by   and which is a component of . The expectation might be that if fewer animals get infected  there should also be a reduction in pathogens. Formula (7) shows that the equilibrium prevalence only depends on   . susceptibility  through . An explanation is that a decrease in susceptibility only means that it takes longer for animals to get infected when facing the same challenge (1/ days)  but eventually they still become infected and shed the same number of bacteria. The advantage of a lower susceptibility  . longer time until infection  is that it takes animals longer to complete the full SELIRS cycle  thereby reducing the number of animals that are diseased at any point in time prior to the equilibrium being reached. Raadsma . [] and Nieuwhof . [] have estimated the heritability for resistance to footrot based on the genetic variation within a population  rather than the response to selection. Therefore  these estimates are independent of possible effects of reduced pathogen burden in selected populations. Little information is available on the value of the recovery rate   and one reason is that prompt treatment of affected animals means it is not fully expressed (. 1/ is censored). The prevalence without treatment could then be considerably higher and  larger. This scenario was investigated with an initial prevalence of 50%  and it was found that in early generations the expected additional effects are in fact negative  but the effect becomes positive later on. The reason for this negative effect  best understood by comparing (8) and (14) is that with increasing recovery rate in the SELDCRS model animals spend increasing times in the  phase  . they are no longer considered diseased but continue to spread bacteria. This slows down the whole cycle  with there being fewer susceptible animals compared to the SELIRS model  where recovered animals move directly to the phase of immunity. For our application to footrot this effect may be considered an artefact of the model  occurring only under extreme assumptions  rather than of biological importance  but it may be relevant for other diseases. Previously  MacKenzie and Bishop [] have shown that in the SIR model applied to viral diseases  if  is high then it may take many generations of selection before the expected number of animals infected during an epidemic is expected to decrease. This  also  is a scenario in which the epidemic model predicts a slower response to selection than the quantitative genetic model. Knowledge of the traits that show genetic variation is clearly important. While the current results suggest that this can be done by comparing the variation within a population with the response to selection  in practice this will be very difficult because it would require an unselected control or population with the same environmental conditions  but not affected by decreased shedding of bacteria by the selected animals. An alternative would be to estimate parameters directly from the length of time various epidemiological stages last  in selected and unselected populations following (deliberate) infection  comparable to the figures in Table . In the absence of any estimates for the genetic variance of resistance to footrot  this study used the threshold model to standardise response to selection. Following the concept of an underlying normally distributed trait in the threshold model  normal distribution were assumed for 1/ and 1/. The inverse of the recovery rate 1/ is a length of time  and it seems plausible that it has a positive skewness  with no negative values  and some animals taking extremely long to recover. A positive skewness looks likely for  as well  especially for scenarios where mean  is in the critical range just above 1  with some animals potentially being extremely infectious. Positively skewed distributions for the inverse 1/ and 1/ would for instance occur if  and  were normally distributed. Under these scenarios  relative responses to selection can be recalculated with appropriately altered selection intensities. However  it should be remembered that a normally distributed liability in the threshold model is also an assumption that can be challenged. It was shown that  under the prevailing assumptions  the reduction in prevalence at a given  does not depend on the rate of loss of immunity  and the rate of conversion of latently infected animals to the infectious state . This does not mean that these parameters are not important for the potential genetic progress; it implies that once the response to one round of selection is known it is possible to predict further response without knowing the values of  and . In the current study  a constant environment and a homogeneous population have been assumed. In practice  environmental conditions will vary and this may affect survival of bacteria in the environment or the animals' phenotypes  while there may also be different classes of animals  . adults and offspring with different phenotypes with regard to the disease. All these variations can be investigated based on the SELIRS equations  but may require running of a dynamic algorithm that calculates daily prevalence  rather than relying on equilibria. In rapidly changing environments the time to reach equilibrium will become an important factor  with potentially no equilibrium being attained by the time prevalence is measured or selection decisions are made. In a stable environment  changes in parameters as a result of selection will lead to only small changes in the expected equilibria so that a new equilibrium can quickly be established. Selection in this study was based on own performance and one observation per animal with disease resistance as the only breeding goal. In practice  information from relatives and repeated measurements will increase the response to selection. On the one hand  assuming that resistance to footrot is not genetically correlated to any other traits under selection  selection on an index of traits will decrease the expected response to selection for resistance. On the other hand  disease information on relatives will greatly improve the potential selection response rates for improved resistance. While all these considerations affect the magnitude of the response to selection  essentially by changing the 'h' term in the response equations  they do not alter the nature of the epidemiological effects of selection. Therefore  simple extrapolation is appropriate. The models developed in this study are used to consider an endemic bacterial disease with bacteria being transmitted through the environment  where they can only survive for a limited period of time. The models can be applied to a variety of diseases and host species  where these conditions apply. The general trend of results is in fact similar to that seen for a different disease  ruminant gastro-intestinal parasitism  as shown by Bishop and Stear []. One difference is that these authors had better estimates of some traits  especially the rate at which animals spread infection  as this is captured in the faecal egg count trait. Based on the current study it can be expected that selection for resistance to footrot in sheep will be more considerably effective  especially in the medium term  than purely genetic models predict. There are  however  many other important issues to consider in a practical breeding programme  such as obtaining consistent disease scores across a population of sufficient size and the simultaneous selection for other traits  which may be correlated  on a phenotypic or genetic level  with resistance to footrot. In summary  this paper presents a novel epidemic model  applied to footrot in an attempt to explore likely responses to selection. A key parameter for the model  and also from a biological perspective  is the recovery rate. Given the long time that it takes animals to recover from the disease without human intervention  low values for the rate of recovery () seem likely. If this is indeed the trait under selection when selecting for increased resistance  then the response to selection in terms of observed prevalence  including effects of reduced pathogen burden  could in the medium term be double that predicted by purely genetic models. Assuming that  is large  so that  is approximately equal to   in the SEIR model an infected animal sheds  infectious doses over 1/ days  these doses survive for 1/ days infecting / daily so that  = /. A more formal derivation is given in []. The extra  step in the SELIRS model does not affect this  as all latently infected animals will (sooner or later depending on ) become diseased. For most parameter values  the loss of immunity ( animals reverting to ) does not affect the number of secondary infections  but extreme parameter values (long-lived environmental contamination combined with a short period of immunity) may lead to more secondary infections. At the equilibrium (denoted by *) all derivatives  d/d etc are equal to 0  so that from (4) it follows that:  =  = ---.(20) From (5) * = */  and combining (3) and (4) gives  = */*  while from (2) * = */  so that  = /. Substituting into (A1) then gives:  = -/--  (21) Rearranging and solving for  yields: Following Appendix A   for the SELDCRS model can be calculated from the product of number of infectious doses produced at rate  by an infectious animal over the duration of the infection (1/+1/)  the time these infections survive in the environment (1/) and the number of animals that will be infected at a rate of   so that: As with the SELIRS model in Appendix B  the equilibrium prevalence  can be calculated by setting all derivatives to 0. Combining (3) and (10) then gives  = */*  and from (9) and (11) it follows that so that: From (10)  (11) and (12)   = /   = / and  = /. Substituting these values in  =  and rearranging yields: Therefore  from (14) the equilibrium prevalence is From (15)   with  (K set to be constant). Therefore . Now consider the derivative d d. Solving this equation we obtain: Therefore: Thus  in the SLEDCRS model the predicted response in * to changes in  is a linear function of (1/ + 1/)  and it also depends on  and * but under the model assumptions it is independent of . Define a new parameter  so that  and  is independent of .

Use of extreme samples seems to enhance the ability of feature selection procedures to select influential SNPs in genetic association studies. In genetic association studies of complex traits  assessing many loci jointly may be more informative than testing associations at individual markers. Firstly  the complexity of biological processes underlying a complex trait makes it probable that many loci residing on different chromosomes are involved [  ]. Secondly  carrying out thousands of dependent single marker tests tends to produce many false positives. Even when significance thresholds are stringent  \"significant\" markers that are detected sometimes explain less than 1% of the phenotypic variation []. Standard regression models have problems when fitting effects of a much larger number of SNPs (and  possibly  their interactions) than the number of observations available. To address this difficulty  a reasonable solution could be pre-selection of a small number of SNPs  followed by modeling of associations between these SNPs and the phenotype []. Other strategies include stepwise selection []  Bayesian shrinkage methods []  and semiparametric procedures  such as mixed models with kernel regressions [  ]. Machine learning methods are alternatives to traditional statistical approaches. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that \"learns\" from past examples  and then uses the learned rules to classify new data []. Their typical use is in a classification framework  .  disease classification. For example  Sebastiani . [] applied Bayesian networks to predict strokes using SNP information  as well as to uncover complex relationships between diseases and genetic variants. Typically  classification is into two classes  such as \"unaffected\" and \"affected\". Multi-category classification has been studied  for example  by Khan . [] and Li . []. It is more difficult than binary assignment  and classification accuracy drops as the number of categories increases. For instance  the error rate of random classification is 50% and 90% when 2 and 10 categories are used  respectively. In a previous study of SNP-mortality association in broilers []  the problem was cast as a case-control binary classification by assigning sires in the upper and lower tails of the empirical mortality rate distribution  into high or low mortality classes. Arguably  there was a loss of information about the distribution  because intermediate sires were not used. In the present work  SNP-mortality associations were studied as a multi-category classification problem  followed by a filter-wrapper SNP selection procedure [] and SNP evaluations. All sire family mortality rates were classified into specific categories based on their phenotypes  and the number of categories was varied (2  3  4  5 or 10). The objectives were: 1) to choose an integrated SNP selection technique by comparing three classification algorithms  naïve Bayes classifier (NB)  Bayesian network (BN) and neural network (NN)  with different numbers of categories  and 2) to ascertain the most appropriate use of the sire samples available. Genotypes and phenotypes came from the Genomics Initiative Project at Aviagen Ltd. (Newbridge  Scotland  UK). Phenotypes consisted of early (0–14d) and late (14–42d) age mortality status (dead or alive) of 333 483 chicks. Birds were raised in either high (H) or low (L) hygiene conditions: 251 539 birds in the H environment and 81 944 in the L environment. The H and L environments were representative of those in selection nucleus and commercial levels  respectively  in broiler breeding. Information included sire  dam  dam's age  hatch and sex of each bird. There were 5 523 SNPs genotyped on 253 sires. Each SNP was bi-allelic (.  \"A\" or \"G\" alleles) and genotypes were arbitrarily coded as 0 (AA)  1 (AG) or 2 (GG). A detailed description of these SNPs is given in Long . []. The entire data set was divided into four strata  each representing an age-hygiene environment combination. For example  records of early mortality status of birds raised in low hygiene conditions formed one stratum  denoted as EL (early age-low hygiene). Similarly  the other three strata were EH (early age-high hygiene)  LL (late age-low hygiene) and LH (late age-high hygiene). Adjusted sire mortality means were constructed by fitting a generalized linear mixed model (with fixed effect of dam's age and random effect of hatch) to data (dead or alive) from individual birds  to get a residual for each bird  and then averaging progeny residuals for each sire (see Appendix). After removing SNPs with missing values  the numbers of sires and SNPs genotyped per sire were: EL and LL: 222 sires and 5 119 SNPs; EH and LH: 232 sires and 5 166 SNPs. Means and standard deviations (in parentheses) of adjusted sire means were 0.0021 (0.051)  -0.00021 (0.033)  -0.0058 (0.058) and 0.00027 (0.049) for EL  EH  LL and LH  respectively. Subsequently  SNP selection and evaluation were carried out in each of the four strata in the same way. Sire mortality means were categorized into  classes ( = 2  3  4  5 or 10). The adjusted sire means were ordered  and each was assigned to one of  equal-sized classes in order to keep a balance between sizes of training samples falling into each category. For example  with  = 3  the thresholds determining categories were the 1/3 and 2/3 quantiles of the empirical distribution of sire means. This is just one of the many possible forms of categorization  and it does not make assumptions about the form of the distribution. A two-step feature selection method  \"filter-wrapper\"  described in Long . [] was used. There  upper and lower tails of the distribution of sire means were used as case-control samples  and the classification algorithm used in the wrapper step was naïve Bayes. In the present study  all sires were used in a multi-category classification problem  and three classification algorithms (NB  BN and NN) were compared. A collection of 50 \"informative\" SNPs was chosen in this step. It was based on information gain []  a measure of how strongly a SNP is associated with the category distinction of sire mortality means. Briefly  information gain is the difference between entropy of the mortality rate distribution before and after observing the genotype at a given SNP locus. The larger the information gain  the more the SNP reduces uncertainty about mortality rate. As noted earlier  the 50 top scoring SNPs with respect to their information gain were retained for further optimization in the wrapper step. The filter procedure was coded in Java. This procedure is an iterative search-and-evaluate process  using a specific classification algorithm to evaluate a subset of SNPs (relative to the full set of 50 SNPs) searched []. Three classification algorithms  NB  BN and NN  were compared in terms of the cross-validation classification accuracy of the chosen subset of SNPs. Two widely used search methods are forward selection (FS) and backward elimination (BE) []. FS starts from an empty set and progressively adds SNPs one at time; BE starts with the full set  and removes SNPs one at a time. The search methods stop when there is no further improvement in classification accuracy. In general  BE produces larger SNP sets and better classification accuracy than FS [  ]  but it is more time-consuming. Differences in computation time between BE and FS were large when the classification algorithm was BN  which was computationally intensive. However  the difference between FS and BE in terms of classification accuracies of the chosen SNP subsets was small (Appendix). Hence  FS was adopted for BN. For NB and NN the search method was BE. The wrapper procedure was carried out on the Weka platform []. Computing time for running wrapper using the search method selected for each of NB  BN and NN was 1 min for NB  3 min for BN and 8.2 h for NN. These were benchmarked on a dataset with 222 sires and 50 SNPs  which was typical for each stratum. Let ( ...  ) be features (SNPs) with discrete values (.  AA  AG or GG at a locus) used to predict class  (\"low\" or \"high\" mortality). A schematic is in Figure . Given a sire with genotype ( ...  )  the best prediction of the mortality class to which it belongs is that given by class  which maximizes Pr( =  |  =  ...  = ). By Bayes' theorem  .  ...  are SNPs used to predict class  (.  \"low\" or \"high\" mortality). NB assumes SNP independence given . Pr( = ) can be estimated from training data and Pr( =  ...  = ) is irrelevant for class allocation; the predicted value is the class that maximizes Pr( =  ...  = |  = ). NB assumes that  ...  are conditionally independent given   so that Pr( =  ...  = |  = ) can be decomposed as Pr( =  | ) ×  × Pr(= | ). Although the strong assumption of feature independence given class is often violated  NB often exhibits good performance when applied to data sets from various domains  including those with dependent features [  ]. The probabilities  .  Pr( =  | )  are estimated using the ratio between the number of sires with genotype  that are in class   and the total number of sires in class . Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs for representing probabilistic relationships between random variables []. Most applications of BN in genotype-phenotype association studies are in the context of case-control designs (.  []). A node in the network can represent a categorical phenotype (.  \"low\" or \"high\" mortality)  and the other nodes represent SNPs or covariates  as illustrated in Figure  for a 5-variable network. To predict phenotype () given its \"parent\" nodes (Pa()) (.  nodes that point to   such as SNP and SNP)  one chooses  which maximizes Pr( =  | Pa()) []. To learn (fit) a BN  a scoring function that evaluates each network is used  and the search for an optimal network is guided by this score []. In this study  the scoring metric used was the Bayesian metric []  which is the posterior probability of the network () given data (): Pr(|) Pr()Pr(|) Given a network   if Dirichlet distributions are used as conjugate priors for parameters (a vector of probabilities) in   then  Pr( | ) = <U+222B> Pr(|<U+03B8>)Pr(<U+03B8>)  has a closed form. The search method used for learning  was a hill-climbing one  which considered arrow addition  deletion and reversal during the learning process []. This search-evaluation process terminated when there was no further improvement of the score. All networks were equally likely  a priori. . Four nodes ( to ) represent SNPs and one () corresponds to the mortality phenotype. Arrows between nodes indicate dependency. A neural network is composed of a set of highly interconnected nodes  and is a type of non-parametric regression approach for modeling complex functions [  ]. The network used in this study  shown in Figure   is a 3-layer feedforward neural network. It contains an input layer  a hidden layer and an output layer. Each connection has an unknown weight associated with it  which determines the strength and sign of the connection. The input nodes are analogous to predictor variables in regression analysis; each SNP occupies an input node and takes value 0  1 or 2. The hidden layer fitted contained two nodes  each node taking a weighted sum of all input nodes. The node was activated using the sigmoid function:   where ; is SNPand is the weight applied to connection from SNPto hidden node  ( = 1  2). Similarly  a node in the output layer takes a weighted sum of all hidden nodes and  again  applies an activation function  and takes its value as the output of that node. The sigmoid function ranges from 0 to 1  and has the advantage of being differentiable  which is required for use in the back-propagation algorithm adopted in this study for learning the weights from inputs to hidden nodes  and from these to the output nodes []. For a -category classification problem with continuous outputs (as per the sigmoid function)   output nodes were used  with each node being specific to one mortality category. Classification was assigned to the category with the largest output value. The back-propagation algorithm (a non-linear least-squares minimization) processes observation by observation  and it was iterated 300 times. The number of parameters in the network is equal to ( + ) + ( + )  where    and  denote the number of nodes in the input  hidden and output layers  respectively. For example  in a binary classification ( = 2) with 50 input nodes representing 50 SNPs  and two hidden nodes  the number of parameters is 108. . Each SNP occupies an input node and takes value 0  1 or 2. The hidden nodes receive a weighted sum of inputs and apply an activation function to the sum. The output nodes then receive a weighted sum of the hidden nodes' outputs and  again  apply an activation function to the sum. For a 3-category classification ( = 3)  three separate output nodes were used  with each node being specific to one category (low  medium or high). Classification was assigned to the category with the largest output value. Comparison of the three classification algorithms (NB  BN and NN) yielded a best algorithm in terms of classification accuracy. Using the best classification algorithm  there were five optimum SNP subsets selected in the wrapper step in each stratum  corresponding to the 2  3  4  5 or 10-category classification situation  respectively. The SNP subset evaluation refers to comparing the five best SNP subsets in a certain stratum (EL  EH  LL or LH). Two measures were used as criteria; one was the cross-validation predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS)  and the other was the proportion of significant SNPs. In what follows  the two measures are denoted as A and B. Briefly  for measure A  a smaller value indicates a better subset; for measure B  a larger value indicates a better subset. PRESS is described in Ruppert . []. It is cross-validation based  and is related to the linear model: where was sire 's adjusted mortality mean (after standardization  to achieve a zero mean and unit variance); SNPdenotes the fixed effect of genotype of SNPin sire ; and is the number of SNPs in the subset under consideration. Although the wrapper selected a \"team\" of SNPs that act jointly  only their main effects were fitted for PRESS evaluation (to avoid running out of degrees of freedom). The model was fitted by weighted least squares  with the weight for a sire family equal to the proportion of progeny contributed by this sire. The errors were assumed to have a Student-t distribution with 8 degrees of freedom ( 8) distribution  after examining Q-Q plots with normal  -4  -6 and -8 distributions. Given this model  PRESS was computed by Here  is predicted using all sire means except the  th ( = 1  2 ...  ) sire  and this predicted mean is denoted by . A subset of SNPs was considered \"best\" if it produced the smallest PRESS when employing this subset as predictors. A SAS macro was written to generate PRESS statistics and it was embedded in SAS PROC GLIMMIX (SAS 9.1.3  SAS Institute Inc.  Cary  NC). This procedure involved calculating how many SNPs in a subset were significantly associated with the mortality phenotype. Given a subset of SNPs  an -statistic (in the ANOVA sense) was computed for each SNP. Subsequently  given an individual SNP's  statistic  its -value was approximated by shuffling phenotypes across all sires 200 times  while keeping the sires' genotypes for this SNP fixed. Then  the proportion of the 200 replicate samples in which a particular -statistic exceeded that of the original sample was calculated. This proportion was taken as the SNP's -value. After obtaining -values for all SNPs in the subset  significant SNPs were chosen by controlling the false discovery rate at level 0.05 []. The proportion of significant SNPs in a subset was the end-point. This comparison addressed whether or not the loss of information from using only two extreme tails of the sample  as in Long . []  affected the \"goodness\" of the SNP subset selected. Therefore  SNP selection was also performed by an alternative categorization method based on using only two extreme portions of the entire sample of sire means. The two thresholds used were determined by a  such that one was the 100 × a% quantile of the distribution of sire mortality means  and the other was the 100×(1-a)% quantile. SNP selection was based on the filter-wrapper method  as for the multi-category classification  with NB adopted in the wrapper step. Four a values  0.05  0.20  0.35 and 0.50  were considered  and each yielded one partition of sire samples and  correspondingly  one selected SNP subset. In each situation (using all sires . extreme sires only)  the best subset was chosen by the PRESS criterion  as well as by its significance level. That is  the smallest PRESS was selected as long as it was significant at a predefined level (e.g.   = 0.01); otherwise  the second smallest PRESS was examined. This guaranteed that PRESS values of the best SNP subsets were not obtained by chance. Significance level of an observed PRESS statistic was assessed by shuffling phenotypes across all sires 1000 times  while keeping unchanged sires' genotypes at the set of SNPs under consideration. This procedure broke the association between SNPs and phenotype  if any  and produced a distribution of PRESS values under the hypothesis of no association. The proportion of the 1000 permutation samples with smaller PRESS than the observed one was taken as its -value. Classification error rates (using 10-fold cross-validation) of the final SNP subsets selected by the \"wrapper\" with the three classification algorithms are in Table . As expected  error rates increased with  for each classifier  since the baseline error increased with ; in each instance  classifiers improved upon random classification. In all cases  NB had the smallest error rates  and by a large margin. For example  with  = 2  error rates of NB were about half of those achieved with either BN or NN. Therefore  NB was used for further analysis. Results of the comparison of the five categorization schemes ( = 2  3  4  5 and 10) using measures A and B are shown in Table . The approach favored by the two measures was typically different. For EL  measures A (PRESS) and B (proportion of significant SNPs) agreed on  = 2 as best. For EH   = 2 and  = 3 were similar when using measure A;  = 3 was much better than the others when using method B. For LL   = 2 was best for measure A whereas  = 3 or 4 was chosen by B. For LH   = 3 and  = 2 were best for measures A and B  respectively. Overall  classification with 2 or 3 categories was better than classification with more than 3 categories. This implies that measures A and B were not improved by using a finer grading of mortality rates. SNP subsets selected under the five categorization schemes were compared with each other  to see if there were common ones. This led to a total of 10 pair-wise comparisons. The numbers of SNPs in these subsets differed  but were all less than 50  the full set size for \"wrapper\". As a result  the number of common SNPs ranged from 5 to 14 for stratum EL  2 to 9 for EH  2 to 13 for LH and 7 to 16 for LL. As shown in Table   in EL  EH and LL  better SNP subsets (smaller PRESS values) were obtained when using the tails of the distribution of sires  as opposed to using all sires. In LH  a 3-category classification using all sires had a smaller PRESS than a binary classification using 40% of the sire means. In LH with extreme sires  the smallest PRESS value (0.498) was not significant ( = 0.915). This was possibly due to the very small size of the corresponding SNP subset; there were only four SNPs with 3 = 81 genotypes  so the observed PRESS would appear often in the null distribution. Therefore  the second smallest PRESS value (0.510) was used to compare against using all sires. Figures      and  shows the null distributions (based on 1000 permutations) of PRESS values when SNPs were selected using extreme sires or all sires in each stratum. All observed values were \"significant\" ( = 0.007)  indicating that the PRESS of each SNP subset was probably not due to chance. .

Observed PRESS values are marked in the plots  with dashed arrows when using extreme sires and solid arrows when using all sires. Arguably  the conditional independence assumption of NB  .  independence of SNPs given class  is often violated. However  it greatly simplifies the learning process  since the probabilities of each SNP genotype  given class  can be estimated separately. Here  NB clearly outperformed the two more elaborate methods (BN and NN). One reason could be that  although simple decomposition using the independence assumption results in poor estimates of Pr( =  |  =  ...  = )  the correct class still has the highest estimated probability  leading to high classification accuracy of NB []. Another reason might be overfitting in BN and NN  especially in the current study  where there were slightly over 200 sires in total. Overfitting can lead to imprecise estimates of coefficients in NN  and imprecise inference about network structure and associated probabilities in BN. In this sense  a simpler algorithm  such as NB  seems more robust to noisy data than complex models  since the latter may fit the noise. The best way to avoid overfitting is to increase size of training data  so that it is sufficiently large relative to the number of model parameters (.  5 times as many training cases as parameters). If sample size is fixed  approaches for reducing model complexity have to be used. In the case of NN  one can reduce the number of hidden nodes or use regularization (weight decay)  to control magnitude of weights []. For BN  the number of parent nodes for each node can be limited in advance  to reduce the number of conditional probability distributions involved in the network. One can also choose a network quality measure that contains a penalty for network size  for example  the Bayesian information criterion [] and the minimal description length []. These measures trade off \"goodness-of-fit\" with complexity of the model. Finally  one may consider other classifiers that are less prone to overfitting  such as support vector machines (SVMs) []. Guyon . [] presented a recursive feature elimination-based SVM (SVM-RFE) method for selecting discriminant genes  by using the weights of a SVM classifier to rank genes. Unlike ranking which is based on individual gene's relevance  SVM-RFE ranking is a gene subset ranking and takes into account complementary relationship between genes. An alternative to the filter-wrapper approach for handling a large number of genetic markers is the random forests methodology []  which uses ensembles of trees. Each tree is built on a bootstrap sample of the original training data. Within each tree  the best splitting SNP (predictor) at each node is chosen from a random set of all SNPs. For prediction  votes from each single tree are averaged. Random forests does not require a pre-selection step  and ranks SNPs by a variable importance measure  which is the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting a SNP. Unlike a univariate one-by-one screening method  which may miss SNPs with small main effects but large interaction effects  ranking in random forests takes into account each SNP's interaction with others. Thus  random forests have gained attention in large scale genetic association studies  for example  for selecting interacting SNPs []. In fact  the wrapper is designed to address the same problem  by evaluating a subset of SNPs rather than a single SNP at a time. However  it cannot accommodate the initial pool of a large number of SNPs due to computational burden  so a pre-selection stage is required. In this sense  wrapper is not as efficient as random forests. In the case when correlated predictors exist  Strobl . [] pointed out that the variable importance measures used in ordinary random forests may lead to biased selection of non-influential predictors correlated to influential ones  and proposed a conditional permutation scheme that could better reflect the true importance of predictors. The number of top scoring SNPs (50) was set based on a previous study []  where it was found that  starting with different numbers (50  100  150  200 and 250) of SNPs  a naïve Bayes wrapper led to similar classification performances. To reduce model complexity and to save computational time  a smaller number of SNPs is preferred. To examine whether the 50 SNPs were related to each other or not  a redundancy measure was computed  to measure similarity between all pairs of the 50 SNPs (1225 pairs in total). Redundancy is based on mutual information between two SNPs  and ranges from 0 to 0.5  as in Long . []. Redundancies were low and under 0.05 for almost all pairs. For example  in stratum EL-3-category classification  1222 out of 1225 pairs had values under 0.05. This indicates that SNP colinearity was unlikely in the subsequent wrapper step  which involved training classifiers using the SNP inputs. As illustrated by the error rates found in the present study  multi-category classification gets harder as the number of categories () increases. This is because the baseline predictive power decreases with   and average sample size for each category also decreases with   which makes the trained model less reliable. To make a fair comparison among SNP subsets found with different   the same evaluation procedure  neutral with respect to filter-wrapper and   was uniformly applied to each setting. By using mortality means in their original form (a continuous response variable  as opposed to a discretized variable)  two measures were used. Measure A (PRESS) evaluated a subset of SNPs from the perspective of predictive ability  while measure B estimated the proportion of SNPs in a subset that had a statistically significant association with mortality. Although the best SNP subset was measure-dependent  it was either with  = 2 or  = 3. Thus  it appears that classification into two or three categories is sufficient. The comparison between SNP subsets selected using sires with extreme phenotypic values and those selected using all sire means indicated better performance of the former strategy of SNP detection. This is so  at least in part  because concern is about classification accuracy  and obtaining more informative samples for each class is more important than avoiding loss of information resulting from discarding some sire means. Perhaps including all sire samples brings noise  leading to a poorer predictive ability of the selected SNPs. In order to assess significance of the observed difference in PRESS between using \"extreme\" and \"all\" strategies  one can shuffle sire means over genotypes B (.  1000) times  generating B permutation samples. For each of the B samples  apply \"extreme\" and \"all\" to get PRESS  and then take their difference. This would produce a null distribution  against which the observed difference in PRESS can be referred to. This was not done in this study  due to extra computational intensiveness. In the context of selecting SNPs associated with chick mortality  two conclusions emerge. First  if one wishes to utilize all sire samples available  a good choice consists of a naïve Bayes classifier  coupled with a categorization of mortality rates into two or three classes. Second  one may want to use more extreme (hence more representative) samples  even at the cost of losing some information  to achieve better predictive ability on the selected SNPs. In summary  and in the spirit of the studies of Long . [  ]  a filter-wrapper two step feature selection method was used effectively to ascertain SNPs associated with quantitative traits. The sets of interacting SNPs identified in this procedure can then be used in statistical models for genomic-assisted prediction of quantitative traits [    –]. To create a response variable for each of the sires genotyped  effects of factors (dam's age and hatch) potentially affecting individual bird survival were removed via a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) without sire and hygiene effects. For each bird  a residual derived from the GLMM was calculated. Birds were classified into two groups  corresponding to the hygiene environments (L and H) in which they had been raised. In each hygiene group  residuals of progeny of a sire were averaged  producing an adjusted progeny mortality mean as the response variable for each sire. The individual record on each bird was binary (dead or alive)  and the GLMM fitted was: logit() =  + DA+ H  (1) where is the death probability of bird   progeny of a dam of age  and born in hatch . Here  DAstands for the fixed effect of the  th level of dam's age ( = 1  2 ...  18); Hdenotes the random effect of hatch  ( = 1  2 ...  232)  which was assumed normal  independent and identically distributed as ~NIID(0  )  where  was the variance between hatches. Let be the true binary status of bird  (0 = alive  1 = dead) and  be the fitted death probability using model (1); then  the residual for a given bird is = -   with a sampling space of [-1 1]. GLMM was implemented in SAS PROC GLIMMIX (SAS 9.1.3  SAS Institute Inc.  Cary  NC). Model (1) was fitted to both early and late mortality data. Subsequently  birds were divided into the two hygiene groups  and progeny residuals were averaged for each sire  as described above. Thus  four strata of age-hygiene combinations were formed  with each stratum containing the adjusted progeny mortality means calculated for: 1) birds of early age raised in low hygiene (EL); 2) birds of early age raised in high hygiene (EH); 3) birds of late age raised in low hygiene (LL); and 4) birds of late age raised in high hygiene (LH). Choosing a proper search method was relevant primarily to a BN-wrapper  because of computational issues. Using data from the EL stratum and for  = 3 categories  computing time and predictive (classification) performance were monitored simultaneously for BE and FS (Fig ). Computational time was the total time consumed by wrapper; prediction performance was measured as error rate of the final best SNP subset selected by wrapper. The full set's size was increased by 2 SNPs at a time until reaching 30. The difference between BE and FS in terms of computing time was clear (see two hollow-square lines): BE-time grew rapidly with the number of SNPs  while FS-time was lower and stable. The difference in time consumed was up to about 90 min for 30 SNPs. In contrast  the difference between BE and FS in terms of their prediction error rates was small. Patterns of Figure  should apply to other situations as well. The BN-wrapper adopted FS as search method in this work. . Blakey JD: Looking for a bit of co-action?. Thorax. 2007  62: 196-197.

However  other effects of  selection are uncertain. Ovine progressive pneumonia/Maedi-Visna virus (OPPV) may infect up to 66% of a flock thus any affect of  selection on OPPV susceptibility or disease progression could have major impact on the sheep industry. Hypotheses that the  allele is 1) associated with the presence of OPPV provirus and 2) associated with higher provirus levels were tested in an Idaho ewe flock. OPPV provirus was found in 226 of 358 ewes by quantitative PCR. The frequency of ewes with detectable provirus did not differ significantly among the     and  genotypes (p > 0.05). Also  OPPV provirus levels in infected ewes were not significantly different among codon 171 genotypes (p > 0.05). These results show that  in the flock examined  the presence of OPPV provirus and provirus levels are not related to the  allele.

However  other effects of  selection are uncertain. Ovine progressive pneumonia/Maedi-Visna virus (OPPV) may infect up to 66% of a flock thus any affect of  selection on OPPV susceptibility or disease progression could have major impact on the sheep industry. Hypotheses that the  allele is 1) associated with the presence of OPPV provirus and 2) associated with higher provirus levels were tested in an Idaho ewe flock. OPPV provirus was found in 226 of 358 ewes by quantitative PCR. The frequency of ewes with detectable provirus did not differ significantly among the     and  genotypes (p > 0.05). Also  OPPV provirus levels in infected ewes were not significantly different among codon 171 genotypes (p > 0.05). These results show that  in the flock examined  the presence of OPPV provirus and provirus levels are not related to the  allele. Therefore  a genetic approach to scrapie control is not expected to increase or decrease the number of OPPV infected sheep or the progression of disease. This study provides further support to the adoption of  selection as a scrapie control measure. Scrapie is the prototypical prion disease and one of several described in animals and humans. Accumulation of disease associated prion protein (PrP)  an abnormally folded form of normal host prion protein (PrP)  is central to disease and expression of the host prion gene () is necessary in pathogenesis [].  open reading frame (ORF) variants associate with disease incubation time [] and relative disease susceptibility in sheep [–]  goats [–]  elk [–]  deer [  ] and humans [–]. Polymorphisms in sheep at  codons 136 (Alanine/Valine)  154 (Arginine/Histidine)  and 171 (Glutamine/Arginine) are involved in scrapie susceptibility (for review see []). Codon 171 is an important element of susceptibility in the United States (US) sheep population [  ]. Sheep homozygous for glutamine at codon 171 () are highly susceptible to Scrapie  whereas sheep heterozygous () or homozygous () for arginine are highly resistant to classical strains of US Scrapie. The  allele predominates in US sheep whereas the  allele and  genotype are less common (the latter two occur at a frequency of about 37% and 16%  respectively []). Selective breeding for the  minor allele to produce animals with the  or  genotypes is sometimes used as a Scrapie control measure  however the functional consequences of  selection on other traits is uncertain. Genetic selection may have unexpected positive or negative effects as individual genes may have multiple biological roles (pleiotropy) or may be linked to other genes that impact overall biological functions. Uncertainty regarding  selection effects (beyond Scrapie resistance) has led to investigation of multiple ovine traits related to reproduction  milk  meat  fiber and genetic diversity. However   selection effects on disease susceptibility (besides Scrapie) has only been studied for  resistance []. Ovine progressive pneumonia/Maedi-Visna virus (OPPV) is a monocyte/macrophage tropic lentivirus (a subclass of retrovirus) endemic in many US sheep flocks and causes pneumonia  mastitis  arthritis and encephalitis. One in five sheep are infected based on detection of anti-OPPV serum antibodies and seroprevalence can be as high as 66% in open rangeland environments [  ]. As many as 76% of OPPV seropositive sheep may develop OPPV related diseases []. OPPV quantitative PCR (qPCR) is an alternative method to detect lentivirus and provides both diagnostic and prognostic information [–]. The qPCR assay measures the presence and amount of virus that has been reverse-transcribed and integrated into the host genome (provirus). The technique is a useful indicator of disease progression in the study of OPPV because OPPV provirus levels correlate with the severity of pulmonary lesions [  ]. Scrapie is diagnosed in about one of every 500 culled sheep [] thus OPPV has much greater prevalence. Uncertainty regarding whether  selection would effect OPPV provirus levels can create producer reluctance to the implementation of  selection when OPPV is a more severe flock-health problem. A prion-retrovirus pathogenic relationship of undetermined mechanisms has been observed between PrP and Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) []  PrP and Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) [J Stanton  personal communication]  PrP and mastitis presumptively caused by OPPV []  and influence of PrP expression on HIV infection []. In this study  the following two hypotheses were tested in an Idaho ewe flock: 1) the  codon  allele is associated with the presence of OPPV provirus and 2) the  allele is associated with higher OPPV provirus levels. This study will help guide producer decisions and it provides information for future prion-retrovirus co-infection studies and advances knowledge of whether  selection affects other infectious diseases. Three hundred fifty eight ewes were sampled from a flock in southeastern Idaho in which OPPV is endemic and there are no reported cases of scrapie. Animals were cared for under guidelines of the United States Sheep Experimental Station Institutional Care and Use Committee. Breeding was performed without prior selection of prion genotype. The sample set was composed of 117 Columbia  116 Polypay  and 125 Rambouillet sheep. Ages were three  four  five and six years with 39  30  31  and 17 Columbia; 27  31  33  and 25 Polypay; and 32  32  36  and 25 Rambouillet  respectively. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were isolated from whole blood as described []. Genomic DNA was extracted from PBL using a commercial kit (Gentra  Minneapolis  Minnesota). DNA amplification and sequencing of the ovine  ORF was performed similarly to previous experiments using forward primer 5'-GGCATTTGATGCTGACACC-3' and reverse primer 5'-TACAGGGCTGCAGGTAGAC-3' []. Reverse primer 5'-GGTGGTGACTGTGTGTTGCTGA-3' was used for standard dideoxynucleotide sequencing. All sequencing was performed at the Laboratory for Biotechnology and Bioanalysis (Washington State University  Pullman  WA).  genotypes were analyzed using commercial software (Vector NTI  Invitrogen; Carlsbad  CA or Lasergene Seqman Pro v7.1  DNAstar  Inc  Madison  WI) and codon variants reported by single letter code (. glutamine   arginine   valine   histidine    leucine   phenylalanine ). PPV provirus level was determined using a previously described quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay []. The OPPV qPCR used primers TMENVCONf 5'-TCA TAG TGC TTG CTATCA TGG CTA-3' and TMENVCONr 5'-CCG TCC TTG TGT AGG ATT GCT-3' (Invitrogen Corporation  Carlsbad  CA) and a Taqman 5'-5'-hexachlorofluorescein-AGC AAC ACC GAG ACC AGC TCC TGC-3' Black Hole Quencher-1 probe (Integrated DNA Technologies  Coralville  IA) targeting the highly conserved transmembrane region within the envelope gene of the North American OPPV strains []. Two types of genotypic comparison were made using provirus data and  genotype  with a minimum  allele frequency of 10% required for analysis. Association between  genotype and presence or absence of OPPV provirus was tested using logistic regression models from the logistic procedure of SAS v9.1 (SAS Institute  Cary  NC). Association between  genotype and the level of logarithm (base 10)-transformed provirus in OPPV positive animals was tested using the glm procedure in SAS v9.1. In each case the association model included breed as a categorical predictor  age as a linear covariate  the interaction between breed and age  and the  genotype of interest. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated for the pair-wise comparison of the frequency of OPPV positive ewes in each  genotype. Adjusted mean log-transformed provirus levels were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Stepdown Bonferroni p-value correction [] was applied separately to each set of analyses. The  genotypes were determined as the first step in testing association with the presence of OPPV provirus and OPPV provirus levels.  ORF coding variants were identified at codons 101()  136()  141()  143 ()  154 ()  and 171 () (Table ). Of the 358 sheep sampled  100 (28%) were   179 (50%) were  and 79 (22%) were   providing a representation of all three genotypes (Fig.   left). Examination of the  allele relative to the overall  ORF showed that in all animals with the  genotype there were no other  codon variants present. Codon changes at other positions only occurred in animals that had at least one wild type  allele. Of the 358 sheep  279 (78%) were   71 (20%) were  and 8 (2%) were  (Fig.   right). Since codons 143 and 171 had amino acid substitutions with a minor allele frequency of at least 10% they were further analyzed  except for the rare  genotype. Codons 101  136  141  and 154 had a minor allele frequency of less than 10% and therefore these four codons were excluded from further association analysis.    = codon 171   = codon 143   = number of animals. The presence or absence of OPPV provirus was compared among the  171 and  143 genotypes  using a statistical model accounting for age and breed  to determine if minor alleles within those genotypes affected the number of sheep that had detectable OPPV provirus. In the flock  226 of 358 (63.1%) sheep had detectable OPPV provirus. Over half of the ewes were positive for OPPV provirus within each  171 or 143 genotype (Table ). The frequency of OPPV positive animals was not significantly different between the     and  genotypes as indicated by nominal and corrected p-values greater than 0.05 (Table ) and equivalent odds ratios (Fig. ). The 95% confidence intervals also indicate the range of potential effect sizes consistent with these data (Fig. ). Also  the frequency of OPPV positive animals did not differ significantly between the  and  genotypes.   . The levels of OPPV provirus were compared among the  171 and  143 genotypes to determine whether particular genotypes were associated with higher or lower provirus levels once a ewe became infected. Adjusted mean log-transformed provirus levels with 95% confidence interval were equivalent among codon 171 and among codon 143 genotypes (Fig. ). Adjusted mean log-transformed provirus levels were not significantly different among the     and  genotypes or among the  and  genotypes in which nominal and corrected p-values were greater than 0.05 (Table ).   . The present study was performed to determine if a  selection program impacts the presence or magnitude of OPPV infection. Allelic variation in  could affect OPPV status if  variants produce changes in PrP function or expression level relevant to OPPV  if  is a pleiotropic gene  or if there are other molecules involved in prion pathogenesis that also affect OPPV pathogenesis. Alternatively  there may be nearby chromosomal regions affecting OPPV pathogenesis that are in linkage disequilibrium with certain  alleles including  but not limited to  variants of  promoter regions or  homologues. However  the lack of association between  genotype and OPPV status in this study indicates that the presence of a specific  genotype does not influence the presence or magnitude of OPPV infection in this flock. The study demonstrated that the frequency of sheep with detectable OPPV provirus was not related to the  (or ) allele in an Idaho ewe flock. This suggests that it is no more likely that a  or  sheep within a flock would become infected when compared to a  sheep. Likewise  the data suggest there is no difference in frequency of infection between the  and  sheep. Only ewes were sampled in this study so it is possible that introduction of rams could have a different affect  however it is unlikely considering that the frequency of OPPV in rams is equivalent  or perhaps lower than OPPV frequency in ewes [  ]. Also  provirus levels in OPPV positive animals were not related to the  and  alleles. Thus   selection should not affect progression of disease once animals become infected with OPPV. A shift of flock genetics to a greater frequency of  or  sheep is unlikely to accelerate shedding or transmission of OPPV. In these sheep there also was no difference in provirus levels between animals of the  and  genotypes  thus there are no documented cases where PRNP genotypes impact OPPV infection. Recent studies have shown that factors such as breed and age are important for OPPV  therefore all analyses in this study accounted for breed  age and differences in how each breed handled OPPV with age. For example  Rambouillet ewes are less likely to be positive for OPPV provirus than Columbia ewes and Rambouillet ewes can also better control OPPV provirus levels than either Columbia or Polypay ewes [  ]. Further  these breed differences can change over time as some breeds show increasing provirus levels with age while others do not []. However  all the analyses in this study accounted for age and breed in the association models so that these factors would not influence tests for association with PRNP genotype. Interactions between retrovirus' and normal or abnormal prion protein have been previously observed. The current findings do not exclude the possibility that increases in ovine PrP or CD230 expression could alter OPPV replication as observed in a human cell line where over-expression of human PrP thwarted HIV-1 replication []. OPPV replicates in mammary macrophages and microglia and transmits via ewe milk [–] and PrP is found in macrophages of lymphoid follicles and microglia and transmits via ewe milk [–  ] thereby suggesting functional overlap between host proteins involved in both prion and lentivirus pathogenesis. Additional links between prion and retrovirus' are indicated by data showing that caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) aids PrP accumulation in immortalized microglia  [J Stanton  personal communication] and that scrapie infection increases MuLV expression and reciprocally MuLV accelerates scrapie pathogenesis []. This study is one of many examining  selection effects. The  genotype has no apparent effect on reproductive performance [  ]  ovulation rates and litter sizes []  and only the Suffolk breed has lower lamb weaning weights []. Milk production and quality is not effected in Churra []  East Friesian milk sheep [] or Sardinian sheep and there are no significant changes in udder morphology []. Carcass and wool quality are not impaired [  ] and  may positively affect average daily gain [].  has no effect on  resistance []. Finally  pedigree examination in Laxta Black Faced-type Navarra sheep showed no overall negative effect []. The present study taken together with previous investigations indicate that the correlated responses to  selection should be minimal. In total  ten different studies examining reproduction  meat  milk  fiber and infectious disease traits in a dozen different breeds found no overt negative effect from the  allele or  genotype. Additional studies may supplement present and previous results by examining other breeds  genotypes  retrovirus strains  diseases  environmental or management conditions  or production traits. This investigation of a flock with endemic OPPV shows that the frequency of OPPV infection and level of OPPV provirus loads are not affected by the  allele (occurring either in the 171QR heterozygous or 171RR homozygous genotypes) and supports  selection as a component of Scrapie control programs.

Classical  ancestral (.  the inbreeding of an individual's ancestors according to two different formulae) and new inbreeding coefficients (.  part of the classical inbreeding coefficient that is not accounted for by ancestral inbreeding) were computed for all animals. The effect of each coefficient on 305-day milk  fat and protein yield as well as calving interval  age at first calving and survival to second lactation was investigated. Ancestral inbreeding accounting for all common ancestors in the pedigree had a positive effect on 305-day milk and protein yield  increasing yields by 4.85 kg and 0.12 kg  respectively. However  ancestral inbreeding accounting only for those common ancestors  which contribute to the classical inbreeding coefficient had a negative effect on all milk production traits decreasing 305-day milk  fat and protein yields by -8.85 kg  -0.53 kg and -0.33 kg  respectively. Classical  ancestral and new inbreeding generally had a detrimental effect on fertility and survival traits. From this study  it appears that Irish Holstein-Friesians have purged some of their genetic load for milk production through many years of selection based on production alone  while fertility  which has been less intensely selected for in the population demonstrates no evidence of purging. Inbreeding is defined as the probability that two alleles at any locus are 'identical by descent' [] and occurs when related individuals are mated. Inbreeding results in an increase in the number of homozygous loci []  which may lead to an increase in the accumulation of recessive alleles. Mendelian factors unfavourable to fitness are more frequently recessive than dominant for two reasons: firstly  mutations tend to have negative effects on fitness and secondly  because dominant mutations will be quickly selected out of populations. This will lead to an accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles []. The loss in performance and vitality associated with inbreeding is termed \"inbreeding depression\" [] and has generally been shown to be unfavourable []. It has been considered for different traits that dominance []  overdominance []  and epistatic effects [] influences inbreeding depression. Where the genes are governed by dominance  inbreeding depression is caused by an increase in the number of genes with homozygous deleterious recessive genotypes and the decline in performance is expected to be linear with respect to the inbreeding coefficient []. Where traits are governed by overdominance  heterozygotes perform better than either homozygote  thus as inbreeding increases the number of homozygous loci  the proportion of advantageous heterozygous loci decreases. Epistasis occurs when an allele at one locus has an effect on an allele at another locus. Where epistatic interactions exist  a non-linear effect on performance is expected with respect to inbreeding []. The non-linear interactions are explained by the interaction deviation of double or multiple heterozygotes []. Regardless of the mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression  the effects of inbreeding are not consistent across populations or even sub-populations. Thus the level of inbreeding depression experienced is dependent  amongst other factors  on the genetic load of individuals []. Purging of inbreeding depression is a process whereby inbred animals with good performance have been selected from the population as parents  while the poorly performing inbred animals have not been selected. This biases the regression of inbreeding on performance and therefore estimates of inbreeding depression may be regressed towards zero []. Purging has been used as a tool in the breeding programme of the captive Speke's Gazelle to reduce the inbreeding depression expressed []; however it is also thought that purging occurs non-deliberately both in the natural world and in populations subject to selective pressures. Purging has been noted in several captive populations [  ] as well as a feral herd of cattle [] and has also been discussed using simulated populations [–]. Studies  which have investigated the efficacy of artificial selection to purge genetic load  found that after an initial positive response to selection there was a reverse response to selection [  ]. However the authors could find no studies that attempted to quantify if purging existed in natural populations that have been subjected to stringent selective pressures such as in dairy cattle populations. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge. Evidence of purging in a population under performance-related selection such as the Irish population of Holstein-Friesians may help to explain the varying degrees of inbreeding depression observed in different livestock sub-populations globally  in addition to being of a subject of interest from a conservation genetics perspective. Pedigree information on 3 581 380 Holstein-Friesian animals as defined previously [] was extracted from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation database. In addition  all available milk production and fertility performance records for these animals were collated. Lactation information from animals of parities 1 to 5 was retained and milk  fat and protein 305-d yields were predicted using standard lactation curves methodology as outlined by Olori . []. Lactations shorter than 100 d or longer than 400 d were removed. Outliers for milk production were defined as those greater than three standard deviations from the mean and were subsequently removed. Age was centred within parity and outlying ages deviating greater than 24 months from the median age per parity were removed as were animals younger than 20 months at first calving. Age at first calving  calving interval from first to second lactation and survival to second lactation were also calculated. In Ireland  the majority of dairy herds calve cows in the spring  although a small percentage operate a split calving pattern with a proportion of cows calving in the spring and the remainder calving in the autumn. To avoid potential bias on model solutions due to farmers consciously allowing an extended voluntary waiting period post-calving prior to insemination  only herd-years with at least 80% of animals calving between December and June inclusive were retained. Age at first calving was retained where animals calved between 660 and 900 days of age. Only calving intervals to second parity between 300 and 800 days were retained. Survival to second lactation was treated as a binary variable where animals who did not survive to second lactation were assumed to be culled (. survival = 0). For the analysis of milk production  calving interval and survival  contemporary groups of herd-year of calving were generated by concatenating herd and year of calving. For the analysis of age at first calving  contemporary groups of herd-year of birth were generated. Any contemporary group with less than five records was removed. Contemporary groups were generated to reduce the environmental variation caused by different management practises across different herd years. Only animals with at least three complete generations of pedigree information were retained. To investigate the occurrence of purging  a deeper pedigree may be beneficial. However restriction of the data in the present study to animals with at least five complete generations of pedigree resulted in very small datasets and therefore analyses were restricted to animals with at least three complete generations of pedigree. The remaining 88 366 records in the milk production data set had a mean 305-day milk  fat and protein yield of 6 878 kg (SD = 1 445.2 kg)  256 kg (SD = 55.0 kg) and 228 kg (SD = 45.4 kg)  respectively. The fertility data set included 35 013 records on calving interval  33 060 records on age at first calving and 39 741 records on survival to second lactation. These records had a mean calving interval  age at first calving and survival of 411 days (SD = 89.5 days)  763 days (SD = 52.9 days) and 0.78 respectively. Classical inbreeding coefficients were computed and ancestral inbreeding coefficients were computed using the algorithms of Ballou [] and Kalinowski . []  for all animals with production or fertility records available. All inbreeding coefficients were computed using the GRAIN programme from the software package Pedig []  which computes inbreeding coefficients by simulation and gene dropping. In the present study 10 000 simulations were used and correlations between all inbreeding coefficients were tested. Ballou [] defines ancestral inbreeding as follows: where  and are the inbreeding coefficient and ancestral inbreeding coefficient  respectively  and the subscripts  and  represent the individuals sire and dam  respectively. The ancestral inbreeding coefficient as defined by Ballou [] is the cumulative proportion of an individual's genome that has been previously exposed to inbreeding in its ancestors. Thus ancestral inbreeding arising from all common ancestors throughout the individual's pedigree is included in its Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficient regardless of their contribution to the classical inbreeding coefficient. The correlation between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding was relatively weak across both data sets and ranged from 0.36 to 0.40. The algorithm of Kalinowski . [] divides the classical inbreeding coefficient into two components  that where alleles are homozygous as they have met in the past (ancestral inbreeding)  and that where alleles have met for the first time (new inbreeding). The Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding coefficient only includes the ancestral inbreeding of relationships whereby the common ancestor is on both sides of the pedigree (. sire line and dam line). Hence when the classical inbreeding coefficient of an animal is 0  the Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding coefficient is also 0 (Fig. ). The correlation between Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding was strong at 0.99 across both data sets and was to be expected because of the part-whole relationship between them. . The difference between the pedigree of X and Y is the relationship between individual F and I. In Figure 1a  X has a classical inbreeding = 3.90%  new inbreeding = 3.51%  Ballou ancestral inbreeding = 3.13% and Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding = 0.39%. In Figure 1b  Y has a classical inbreeding = 0%  new inbreeding = 0%  Ballou ancestral inbreeding = 3.13% and Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding = 0%. The correlation between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding was weak ranging from 0.28 to 0.38 across both data sets indicating that the two coefficients are measuring different population statistics. Figure  illustrates the difference between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding. \"New\" inbreeding coefficients were also computed for all animals according to Kalinowski . []. New inbreeding refers to that part of the classical inbreeding coefficient  which remains when the portion of the classical inbreeding coefficient explained by ancestral inbreeding has been removed. Therefore new inbreeding is the part of the classical inbreeding coefficient whereby alleles are homozygous and identical by descent but have not met already in the pedigree. Similar to the Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding coefficient  when the classical inbreeding coefficient is zero  the new inbreeding coefficient is also zero and strong correlations between new inbreeding and classical inbreeding of 0.81 and 0.82 were observed across data sets. The ancestral inbreeding coefficient according to Ballou [] will hereafter be referred to as Ballou  the ancestral inbreeding coefficient according to Kalinowski . [] will hereafter be referred to as Kalinowski  and that part of the classical inbreeding coefficient denoting new inbreeding  as defined by Kalinowski . [] will hereafter be referred to as new inbreeding. All analyses were undertaken in ASReml []. The sire models used to estimate inbreeding depression and purging were: Y1 = µ + HY + MTH + PAR + AGE(PAR) + INB + S + e; Y2 = µ + HY + MTH + INB + S + e; where Y1 is lactation milk  fat  and protein yield (kg)  Y2 is calving interval (days)  age at first calving (days) or survival (0/1)  µ is the mean of the population  HY is the fixed effect of herd-year of calving/birth   MTH is the effect of month of calving/birth   PAR is the dam parity ( = 1 to 5)  AGE (PAR) is the age in months  centered within parity   INB is one of either the classical  ancestral  or new inbreeding coefficient of animal   S is the random effect of sire  and e is the random residual effect. A favourable ancestral inbreeding regression coefficient significantly different from zero suggests the occurrence of purging of inbreeding depression for the trait under investigation []  while an unfavourable classical or new inbreeding regression coefficient significantly different from zero indicates inbreeding depression of the trait. In addition to the models described above  two variations were also tested. Firstly  the classical inbreeding coefficient was included in the model together with either the Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficient or the new inbreeding coefficient. Colinearity existed between Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding as estimated using the condition index in PROC REG (SAS Inst. Inc. Cary  NC). Thus Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding was not included as a covariate in the model when classical inbreeding was also included. This model  including the classical inbreeding coefficient and either the Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficient or the new inbreeding coefficient  simultaneously  was solved to detect any changes in the regression coefficient of milk production and fertility on classical inbreeding when ancestral inbreeding or new inbreeding was also included in the model. If classical inbreeding has a greater detrimental effect on performance following the removal of the ancestral inbreeding effect  it may suggest purging of inbreeding depression  as it indicates that ancestral inbreeding has a positive effect on performance and weakens the detrimental effect of classical inbreeding on performance. If classical inbreeding has less of a detrimental effect on performance following the removal of the new inbreeding effect  it may also suggest purging of inbreeding depression as it indicates that new inbreeding enhances the detrimental effect of classical inbreeding. The second model variation tested the interaction between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding. In this model  classical inbreeding was included as a continuous variable in itself  while ancestral inbreeding was only included in a two-way interaction with classical inbreeding. This is similar to the model described by Ballou [] whereby the performance of non-inbred animals is independent of the ancestral inbreeding coefficient  yet ancestral inbreeding can affect the inbreeding effect. Favourable coefficients for the interaction suggest the occurrence of purging of inbreeding depression for that trait []. Comparisons between each of the regression coefficients obtained for the three model variations  together with their respective standard errors were used to determine the differences between the models. The majority of animals used in the analyses were inbred with 97.0% and 97.6% of animals inbred in the milk production and fertility data sets  respectively. The average complete generation equivalent of the animals was 6.29 for the milk production data set and 6.46 for the fertility data set. Mean classical  new and ancestral inbreeding coefficients for all animals in each of the data sets are presented in Table . Average new inbreeding (0.43 to 0.46%) was considerably lower than average classical inbreeding (2.58 to 2.68%) across all data sets indicating that the majority of the average classical inbreeding coefficient is explained by alleles homozygous and identical by descent from a past meeting in an animal's pedigree. As the coefficient of the Ballou measure of ancestral inbreeding [] includes all common ancestors in the pedigree of an individual  regardless of their contribution to the classical inbreeding coefficient  average Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficients (6.50 to 6.89%) were considerably larger than average Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding coefficients (2.15 to 2.22%) across data sets (Table ). Table  summarises the regression coefficients of classical inbreeding  new inbreeding  Kalinowski and Ballou ancestral inbreeding and the interaction between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding on milk production performance. Table  summarises how including either Ballou ancestral or new inbreeding in the model affected the regression coefficient on classical inbreeding. Ballou ancestral inbreeding had a positive effect on milk and protein yield  while the interaction between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding showed similar trends although results were not significantly different from zero (Table ). Classical inbreeding had a numerically greater detrimental effect on milk  fat and protein yield when the Ballou ancestral inbreeding term was also included in the model (Table ). However results were generally not significantly different to when only classical inbreeding was included in the model. Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding had an unfavourable effect on milk production (Table ). Regressions of milk production on Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding were all negative and greater than  although not significantly different from  the regression of milk production performance on classical inbreeding. As new inbreeding increased  there was a strong detrimental effect on milk production and the effect was greater than that observed for the effect of classical inbreeding (Table ). The effect of the different definitions of inbreeding on calving interval  age at first calving and survival are presented in Table . Increases in new inbreeding were associated with a much greater increase in calving interval ( < 0.05) and age at first calving ( < 0.001) than the increases associated with the classical inbreeding coefficient. Both Kalinowski and Ballou ancestral inbreeding had an unfavourable effect on calving interval  age at first calving and survival and were similar in magnitude to the effect of classical inbreeding on the respective traits (Table ). The interaction between Ballou ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding showed a similar trend to the effect of Ballou ancestral inbreeding when included as a separate effect. There was little change in the effect of classical inbreeding on fertility and survival when either the new or ancestral inbreeding term was included in the model (Table ). Classical inbreeding  new inbreeding  and two definitions of ancestral inbreeding as well as the interaction between ancestral inbreeding and classical inbreeding were compared for their effect on milk production  fertility and survival performance in Irish Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. It was postulated that the Irish Holstein-Friesian population would be likely to undergo purging as populations which experience a slow rate of increase in inbreeding over time are more likely to show the effects of purging [] and the rate of increase of inbreeding in the Irish Holstein-Friesian population is relatively low at 0.1% per annum []. Furthermore  the Holstein-Friesian population has undergone intense selection over past decades. Thus the aim of this study was to determine if purging existed within the Irish Holstein-Friesian population. Evidence of purging  as defined by improved performance associated with increased ancestral inbreeding is evident in the Irish population of Holstein-Friesians for milk production. However  results are not consistent across all milk production traits or definition of ancestral inbreeding coefficient. The greater effect of new inbreeding on milk production compared to classical inbreeding (Table ) indicates that the most detrimental portion of the classical inbreeding coefficient is that portion attributable to new inbreeding. This is further substantiated by the positive effect of Ballou ancestral inbreeding on milk and protein yield (Table ) and indicates purging []. The favourable effect of ancestral inbreeding suggests that the increased homozygosity caused by increased inbreeding may be at loci which have a minor or no unfavourable effect on milk production. Results from this study show that inbreeding depression  as defined by classical inbreeding  was greater when Ballou ancestral inbreeding was accounted for in the model (Table )  despite the ancestral inbreeding not always having a positive effect on performance in itself (Table ). In contrast to the regression of milk production on new inbreeding and Ballou ancestral inbreeding  Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding had an unfavourable effect on milk production. As the Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficient details all common ancestors in the pedigree of individuals and not just those common ancestors crossing over between the sire and dam lines as in the Kalinowski ancestral inbreeding coefficient  it is possible that the Ballou ancestral inbreeding coefficient may provide a better representation of the evidence of purging. The evidence of purging within the fertility data sets is less convincing. New inbreeding was associated with a significantly greater increase in calving interval and age at first calving than the increase associated with classical inbreeding (Table ). However  both Kalinowski and Ballou ancestral inbreeding were also associated with unfavourable effects on fertility and survival performance (Table ). This is consistent with the selection history for the ancestors of these animals. Since 2001 in Ireland  genetic merit of dairy animals has been quantified using a total merit index  namely the Economic Breeding Index (EBI)  which comprises of five sub-indices: milk production  fertility  calving performance  health and beef production []. Prior to 2001  selection was primarily based on a production index and a large amount of Holstein-Friesian germplasm was imported into Ireland during this period from countries where the main breeding goal was production []. This contributed to the purging effect in milk production since stochastic simulations undertaken by Hedrick [] showed that purging was most successful when high selection pressure was imposed. As an antagonistic relationship exists between milk production and fertility []  the fertility of these animals may have been genetically compromised. Therefore the ancestral inbreeding coefficient associated with these inbred ancestors is likely to have a detrimental effect on fertility. Additionally any increases in homozygosity from greater inbreeding in selected animals of past generations may have had no effect on production but could have had a deleterious effect on fertility  which went unnoticed. Another possible reason for the lack of a favourable effect of ancestral inbreeding on fertility may be due to inbreeding depression in fertility being predominantly due to overdominance or associative overdominance []. Mc Parland . [] previously investigated the effect of inbreeding on several milk production  calving performance  conformation and fertility traits. They found that the greatest effect of inbreeding was for fertility. The results from this study offer an explanation for that finding. In contrast to milk production  where a positive effect of Ballou ancestral inbreeding on milk production was evident (Table )  beneficial effects of ancestral inbreeding on fertility have not yet become established in the pedigree of the current Irish Holstein-Friesian population due to the lack of selection on fertility. Therefore the entire inbreeding coefficient has a negative effect on fertility performance  not just that part of the inbreeding coefficient explained by new inbreeding. This study demonstrates that purging is likely to have occurred in the Irish Holstein-Friesian population for milk production  but not for fertility. This is consistent with the history of selection in the Irish Holstein-Friesian population  whereby only the more recent generations have been selected for improved fertility. For a thorough analysis of effect of purging on milk production and fertility of cattle  a large population with a deep well-recorded pedigree is an essential requirement.

One measure of these departures is Wright's inbreeding coefficient ()  where observed heterozygosity is compared with expected heterozygosity. Here  I extend population genetics theory to describe post-selection genotype frequencies in terms of post-selection allele frequencies and fitness dominance. The resulting equations correspond to non-equilibrium populations  allowing the following questions to be addressed: When selection is present  how large a sample size is needed to detect significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg? How do selection-induced departures from Hardy-Weinberg vary with allele frequencies and levels of fitness dominance? For realistic selection coefficients  large sample sizes are required and departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions are small. Natural selection modifies the probabilities that alleles are found in either homozygous or heterozygous form. Given that one allele is   what is the probability that the homologous copy of this gene is also  In Hardy-Weinberg populations this is simply equal to   the allele frequency of the  allele. When the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle are violated  such as when viability selection is present  this result cannot be expected to hold. While this has been known for decades  many current studies assume Hardy-Weinberg proportions ( : 2 : ) without explicitly considering the impact of selection. When viability selection results in significant departures from Hardy Weinberg (DHW)  the genetic footprint of natural selection can be observed in sequence data [–]. Tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions have been used to detect genotyping errors [–]. However  it is an open question whether natural selection confounds such tests. Consequently  one can ask: When does natural selection result in significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions? Population genetics theory indicates that when fitnesses are non-multiplicative ( <U+2260> )  genotype frequencies differ from Hardy-Weinberg proportions []. For example  one expects to only find post-selection copies of a recessive lethal in heterozygotes. While equations describing genotypic frequencies in terms of allele frequencies are deducible for overdominance  mutation-selection balance  and other equilibria  existing theory is lacking when it comes to non-equilibrium populations []. There is a need to determine when viability selection leads to significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions []. Classical population genetics contains recursion equations that describe post-selection genotype frequencies in terms of pre-selection allele frequencies. However  DHW calculations require allele and genotype frequencies to be from the same time point (. post-selection). In this paper population genetics theory is extended  and novel equations are derived for non-equilibrium populations at a single time point. These equations allow the magnitude of viability selection-induced DHW to be quantified and statistical significance to be assessed. A number of statistical tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions exist [–]. However  these tests do not distinguish between different causes of DHW (such as genetic drift  population subdivision  genotyping error  and natural selection). By coupling population genetics theory to tests from statistical genetics one can determine whether observed departures from Hardy-Weinberg are due to selection. Sample sizes needed to detect selection are found  and they are substantial. A classical population genetics model is used: Hardy-Weinberg plus selection. Consider a single locus with two segregating alleles. Assume that mutation rates are negligible  and generations are discrete and non-overlapping. The population is assumed to be panmictic and large  yielding a deterministic model. Viability selection acts upon zygotes prior to adulthood  with constant genotypic fitnesses denoted by     and . Genotype frequencies are represented by uppercase letters:     and . Allele frequencies are represented by lower case letters  with pre-selection allele frequencies in boldface ( and ) and post-selection allele frequencies in normal typeface ( and ). After random mating  genotype frequencies are found in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Genotype frequencies are subsequently weighted by fitness  resulting in the following classic equations from population genetics: The above equations can be algebraically manipulated  yielding an equality that contains only post-selection genotype frequencies []. Post-selection genotype frequencies are mathematically related to genotype fitnesses []  and the ratio of genotypic fitnesses in the right hand side of equation () can be replaced by a single parameter that represents the extent of fitness dominance (). Note that  is always positive. Post-selection genotype frequencies differ from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. As per classical population genetics: genotype frequencies sum to one  and allele frequencies are simply weighted genotypic frequencies. These properties  in addition to equation ()  can be combined to obtain post-selection genotype frequencies as a function of post-selection allele frequencies () and the ratio of genotypic fitnesses (). Factoring with respect to produces a second order polynomial equation: (1 - ) + (2)+ 4(1 - ) = 0 (4) For all possible values of  and   the discriminant is positive (. solutions of the quadratic equation are real). However  only one root of the quadratic equation produces valid genotype frequencies. The positive root of the quadratic equation results in heterozygote frequencies between zero and one (see equation 6 below). Conversely  the negative root results in < 0 when  < 1  and > 1 when  > 1. The equations below reduce the description of a post-selection population genetic state to a single allele frequency rather than a collection of genotype frequencies. Using the above equations  the magnitude of viability selection-induced DHW can be quantified. Multiple measures of DHW exist  with one common measure being Wright's inbreeding coefficient [  ]. This is equal to one minus the observed heterozygosity over expected heterozygosity. Note that genotype and allele frequencies in equation () are all post-selection. When  is negative there is an excess of heterozygotes  and when  is positive there is a deficit of heterozygotes relative to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Just as inbreeding can lead to DHW  so too can natural selection. Let be a measure of selection-induced DHW. is derived from equations (6) and (): Genotype frequencies in a sample of size  need not equal the true genotype frequencies of a population. The observed numbers of each genotype are denoted     and (where + + = ). The observed numbers of each genotype in a sample follow a multinomial distribution  and can be used to calculate the magnitude of DHW for a sample (): Given a sample of size   the test statistic  can be calculated. If sample size is large   is conveniently related to  []. When a null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg proportions is true   is approximately distributed as a chi-square with one degree of freedom. When a null hypothesis of Hardy-Weinberg proportions is false   is approximately distributed as a non-central chi-square []. Denoting the non-centrality parameter as :  =  (11) The significance level of a test is equal to a (where a the false positive rate)  and the power of test is equal to 1-ß (where ß is the false negative rate). With one degree of freedom  <U+03BB> equals 3.84 for an a of 0.05 and a ß of 0.5 []. Consequently  equation () can be rearranged to yield the sample size required to detect selection at a significance level of 0.05 and 50% power. The sign and magnitude of selection-induced departures from Hardy-Weinberg are determined by allele frequencies and fitness dominance. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg can be measured by an inbreeding coefficient (). Note that while F-statistics are used  this does not imply that any actual inbreeding is present. Equation () describes the magnitude of selection-induced DHW  and is plotted as a function of  and  in Figure . DHW due to viability selection is maximized at intermediate allele frequencies  and minimized when one allele is rare. This is because inbreeding coefficients are relatively insensitive to DHW when minor allele frequencies are close to zero.  < 1 results in a deficiency of heterozygotes relative to Hardy-Weinberg expectations  while  > 1 results in a surplus of heterozygotes. When  takes on intermediate values (. selection is weak)  is close to zero. . is a function of allele frequency () and fitness dominance (); negative values of indicate an excess of heterozygotes  while positive values of indicate a deficit of heterozygotes  the dashed line corresponds to Hardy-Weinberg proportions. To detect selection  sample sizes ranging from thousands to millions are required. In Table  sample sizes are listed for multiple types of fitness dominance  allele frequencies  and strengths of selection. Statistical significance is set at 0.05  and power is set at 50%. With the sample sizes indicated  statistically significant selection will still only be detected 50% of the time. Equation () indicates that statistical power can be increased above 90% by tripling the sample sizes in Table . Note that small sample sizes are more likely to result in observed allele frequencies that differ from the true allele frequencies of a population. When selection coefficients are large ( = 0.9)  sample sizes on the order of 10 are required to detect selection. When selection coefficients are small  even larger sample sizes are needed. For example   = 0.99 requires sample sizes on the order of 10. Figure  depicts the sample size needed for a range of allele frequencies and selection coefficients. Weak selection and unequal allele frequencies require larger sample sizes  while strong selection and equal allele frequencies require smaller sample sizes. When alleles are found at intermediate frequencies  required sample sizes are largely independent of . The analytic theory used to generate sample sizes was verified by MATLAB simulations. (see Table ). Here  sample genotype frequencies were drawn via multinomial sampling and tested for significant DHW. This was done 10000 times for each set of parameters  and observed power closely matched expected power. . Sample sizes () required to detect selection at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.5 are plotted as a function of allele frequency and fitness dominance; scale on the y-axis is logarithmic; A) Weak selection ( = 0.99); B) Strong selection ( = 0.9); C) Unequal allele frequencies ( = 0.1 and  = 0.9); D) Equal allele frequencies ( = 0.5 and  = 0.5). For moderate levels of fitness dominance ( close to one)  the magnitude of is small. Consequently  Hardy-Weinberg proportions reasonably approximate post-selection genotype frequencies. As a point of comparison  a population containing an uncommon ( = 0.1) completely dominant allele that reduces viability by 1% has the same magnitude of DHW as a population where every mating involves 4 cousins ( ˜ 0.0009). In the context of forensic genetics  the National Research Council set notable levels of DHW at  > 0.01 for cosmopolitan populations []. Given an actual  of this magnitude  a sample size of 38400 would be required to reject a null hypothesis of  = 0 (a = 0.05  ß = 0.5). An interesting property of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium is that one can infer complete single-locus genotypic states from partial data (. one can infer       and  from ). This also holds for post-selection frequencies in a one-locus  two-allele system. An exception involves heterozygote frequency data (which maps to a pair of possible allele frequencies). Given genotypic fitnesses and single genotype frequency   can be found via equation ()  (6)  or (7). Subsequently   and  can be used to obtain the post-selection frequencies of other genotypes. In practice  however  one is much more likely to have complete genotype frequency data than complete knowledge of genotypic fitnesses. Statistically significant DHW requires large departures from neutrality and is maximized at intermediate allele frequencies. For example  a sample size of 1000 is too small to reliably detect significant DHW for a recessive gene that confers a 20% fitness advantage (. power is less than 0.5 for  = 0.5   = 0.83  a = 0.05  and  = 1000). As shown in Figure   sample sizes become prohibitively large when  is close to one. It is known that non-central chi-square tests can over-estimate statistical power when alternative hypotheses differ greatly in their expectations []. However  selection-induced departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions are of small magnitude. As verified by MATLAB simulations  equations () and () accurately determine the sample size needed to detect selection-induced DHW. If only two alleles are segregating  heterozygosity tests of neutrality require large sample sizes [  ]. Many alleles are nearly neutral []  with values of  close to one. However  the scope of undetectable selection extends over a much wider range of parameter space than the range of nearly neutral genes. DHW is a poor indicator of natural selection in the wild. This qualitative conclusion is unlikely to be changed when the assumptions of this paper's model are relaxed. Mutation  assortative mating  and finite population size are all likely to further obscure the signature of selection on genotype frequencies. Also note that genes under directional selection are less likely to be observed at intermediate allele frequencies (. frequencies favourable to the detection of significant DHW). A lack of significant DHW does not imply neutrality. There are large regions of parameter space where viability selection can lead notable changes in allele frequencies over time without producing significant DHW in any single generation. Multiple mechanisms can result in a failure to detect selection even when it is present (. there is a type II error). For example  population structure can modify genotype frequencies  masking the effects of selection. Evolutionary geneticists are more likely to detect the footprint of natural selection via use of multilocus linkage disequilibrium data and Poisson random field models [  ]. Positive selection results in linkage disequilibrium adjacent to the selected locus  the extent of which can be used to estimate the age of alleles. While genotype frequencies at a single locus can be used to detect selection in the most recent generation  linkage disequilibrium data bears the footprint of past selection. Alternatively  natural selection can be measured over multiple generations in the wild [] or via experimental evolution studies. If genotype frequencies are obtained from wild populations  care must be taken to ensure that genotyped individuals share the same age.

Few candidate genes related to soundness traits have been identified in the pig. In this study  2066 commercial females were scored for 17 traits describing body conformation and FL structure  and were used for association analyses. Genotyping of 121 SNPs derived from 95 genes was implemented using Sequenom's MassARRAY system. Based on the association results from single trait and principal components using mixed linear model analyses and false discovery rate testing  it was observed that  and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with body conformation traits. The genes      and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with FL structures  and    and  were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with overall leg action. Strong linkage disequilibrium between  and  on SSC9 was detected  and haplotype -ACGACC- was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with overall leg action and several important FL soundness traits. The present findings provide a comprehensive list of candidate genes for further use in fine mapping and biological functional analyses. The skeleton  defined as the mineralized or mineralizable tissues  forms the essential basis for body framework in higher vertebrates []. The skeletal system  including bone and cartilage  serves as supportive  protective and connective roles for other organs and tissues during the growth and development of individuals  and is involved in determining the body size  shape  physical fitness and leg movement. The developmental processes of skeletons are complicated and are regulated by genetic factors and their interactions with environmental factors [  ]. In humans  abnormal development of the skeleton can lead to or be predisposing to the incidence of a series of bone related disorders  such as dwarfism  osteochondrosis  osteoporosis  osteopetrosis and osteoarthritis  which affect the normal action capability and could result in lameness in severe cases. Feet and leg unsoundness issues are of growing concern in the swine industry. Lameness caused by feet and leg (FL) problems and osteochondrosis are considered to be crucial causes for sow culling [–]. Previous culling rates have been estimated to range from 10 to 40% because of unsoundness issues in young breeding stock [  ]. According to PigCHAMP™ 2007 annual report  the average culling rate of breeding females have been 48.65%  and 20~25% of that was caused primarily by locomotion problems. . The evaluation of FL structure soundness can be implemented using objective and subjective methods. Radiograph  macroscopical joint lesion diagnosis and histological observation  bone length and diameter measurement on specific body locations are expensive and difficult methods for objective evaluation of FL soundness [  –]. The subjective approaches are usually performed by scoring the pastern posture  gait and movement conditions of leg and feet using a scale with numbers ranging between the extreme values [–]. Although objective evaluation measures may be more direct and accurate for FL soundness conditions  the expense and difficulty of collecting measurements on living animals limit their application in the field. The previous studies on genetic parameters demonstrated that the heritability of FL structure traits was low to moderate ranging from 0.01–0.40 [–]. The genetic and phenotypic correlations among most of FL traits are adverse  and some of them have correlation with overall leg locomotion. The studies also indicated that FL unsoundness was unfavorably associated with leanness and some carcass traits [    ]. Due to low to moderate heritability of FL soundness traits  it may be preferable to improve these traits using marker assisted selection (MAS). A limited number of prospective chromosomal regions related to bone strength  locomotion and osteochondrosis-related traits had been identified by previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies in the pig [  ]. However  very few candidate genes related to structural soundness and leg locomotion have been identified in the pig thus far. Most recently  whole genome association studies on human complex diseases have provided a great number of candidate genes pertaining to bone-related disorders [–]. This information makes it possible to conduct candidate gene discoveries in the pig based on the findings in humans. The purpose of this study was to identify the candidate genes associated with body conformation  FL structure soundness and leg action in the pig  focusing a high throughput multiplex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology. The findings will provide genetic factors for structural unsoundness  which can be utilized into MAS schemes to improve these traits in pigs. The study also contributes to the understanding of comparative genetic control on skeletal development between humans and pigs. The present study was conducted on piglets (n = 2 066) entering into the commercial herds from breeding stock originating from the Newsham Choice Genetics company between October 2005 and July 2006. These animals belonged to two genetic lines; 1 000 animals were from a grandparent maternal line and the other 1 066 animals were from a parent maternal line. All of animals in these two lines were Large White × Landrace gilts but actually were derived from different sources and are now both synthetics. The evaluation of 17 traits was carried out as when each animal reached the body weight of ~90 kg. The traits consisted of six body conformation traits including body size (length  depth and width) and body shape (hip structure  rib shape and correctness of top line); five FL structure traits per leg pair  front legs (legs turned  buck knees  pastern posture  foot size and uneven toes) and rear legs (legs turned  weak/upright legs  pastern posture  foot size and uneven toes)  and overall leg action. The scoring formats for traits were modified based on  (Guidelines for uniform swine improvement programs  distributed by National Swine Improvement Federation) and those described by van Steenbergen [] and Serenius et al. []. Scoring trait criterion and the description of scores are shown in Table  and Additional file   respectively. The traits were independently evaluated by two experienced scorers using a 9-point scale  where 1 and 9 indicated the extreme phenotypes of the traits. The intermediate score is the most favorable for four of the scoring traits including correctness of top line  turned front legs  turned rear legs and weak/upright rear legs  and the original scores for these four traits were adjusted by subtracting 5 from the score and taking the absolute value for each animal before performing statistical analyses. Candidate genes were selected for SNP discovery. The genes are involved in skeletal pattern development  bone matrix biosynthesis  osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation  calcium and phosphorus metabolism and bone related signaling pathways. In total  214 genes were initially chosen and among them 95 genes were successfully analyzed in the present study (Additional file ). Corresponding human gene sequences for exons  introns  5'UTR and 3'UTR were retrieved from the Ensembl database   and they were blasted using the default parameters (0.01; low complexity; 100; 100; -G5-E2) against the pig genomic sequence database to obtain homologous pig sequences ; . Primers were designed through Primer 3.0 . Ear tissue was collected from animals using the TypiFix™ ear tag from Agrobiogen (Hilgertshausen  Germany). The DNA was isolated from dry ear tissue using the DNeasy 96 Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen  Valencia  CA  USA). The PCR system consisted of 12.5 ng porcine genomic DNA  1 × GoTaq PCR buffer  0.125 mM of each dNTP  0.25 mM of each primer and 0.25 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega  Madison  WI  USA) in a 10 µl reaction volume. The PCR conditions were 94°C for 4 min  35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec  optimum annealing temperature (54–62°C) for 30 sec and 72°C for 30 sec  with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C using MJ-PTC 200 thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories  South San Francisco  CA  USA). PCR products from the DNA of several animals with extreme phenotypes were pooled and sequenced (DNA Facility of Iowa State University  Ames  IA  USA). Five multiplexed assays for 172 SNPs were designed by means of the MassARRAY Design software and were run through Sequenom's MassARRAY system (Sequenom Inc  San Diego  CA  USA). The normality testing and phenotypic correlations among traits were estimated using UNIVARIATE and CORR (Pearson) procedures of the SAS software package (SAS Institute  release 9.1  Cary  NC  USA)  respectively. Genotype frequency  minor allele frequency (MAF) and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing were calculated with the computer program developed by our lab. Association analyses between SNPs and the traits were carried out using the MIXED procedure of the SAS package. The statistical model used in this study is as follows: =  + Animal+ Sire+ Gilt line+ Evaluation date+ Scorer+ Genotype+ b·(Body weight) +  In this model  gilt line  evaluation date  scorer and marker genotype were fixed effects; sire and animal were random effects; body weight was a covariate and b is the regression coefficient. The animals with unknown sire information were considered to be derived from a different sire in order to ensure the validity of association analyses. The significance of fixed effects was determined using Type 3 tests. The raw P-values were adjusted using multiple testing  which was implemented with resampling-based false discovery rate (FDR) methods with the MULTTEST package of the R program []  and a 20% threshold of FDR was applied to avoid false positives and consider significant SNPs. Haplotype analyses and graphical representation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure as measured by  were performed with the Haploview software (ver. 3.32) []. Haplotypes were obtained for each animal using the PHASE computer program (ver. 2.1) []. The association analyses between different copy numbers of specific haplotypes and traits were executed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as mentioned above. In addition  principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted with the PRINCOMP procedure of the SAS package. The first component of PCA is the mathematical combination of measurements explaining the largest amount of variability in the data  and the association analyses between the SNPs and principal components (PC1 and PC2) in this study were performed using the MIXED model as described above. The basic statistics and phenotypic correlations between the analyzed traits are listed in Table  and Additional file   respectively. Apart from the four traits with intermediate values  population average values of most traits were between 4.1 and 5.3. There was no highly significant phenotypic correlation between most of the analyzed traits. Body conformation traits showed small  generally non-significant correlations with overall leg action. PCA was performed on body conformation and FL structural traits separately because of the low phenotypic correlations between the traits (Additional file ). For body conformation traits  the cumulative proportion of the first three principal components (PC1  PC2 and PC3) reached 72%. The PC1 was mainly comprised of body depth  body width and rib shape  which explained 34% of total variation and mainly described body volume in a biological sense. The PC2 consisted primarily of hip structure and top line traits  and described side profile and the PC3 focused on body length. However  for FL structural traits and overall leg action  PC1  PC2 and PC3 accounted for 42% of total variation. The PC1 mainly included overall leg action  front pastern posture  rear pastern posture and buck knee obtained around 20% of total variation and could be considered as an indicator for leg movement evaluation. The PC2 was mostly composed of foot size per pair  describing feet defects  and the PC3 was mainly comprised of uneven toes per pair  which reflects small inner toe problems. Among the 214 genes chosen in the study  435 SNPs were detected in 146 genes and the SNPs were deposited to dbSNP of NCBI (Accession numbers: ss86352080-ss86352515). Excluding SNPs with no call  monomorphism  mistaken inheritance  MAF less than 5% and a call rate less than 85%  119 SNPs from 95 genes were successfully genotyped by Sequenom's MassARRAY system. Detailed information including the analyzed genes  SNP types  locations and other statistics was summarized in Additional file . Empirical P-values for association analyses between SNPs and a single trait  and labeled SNPs representing ones that were significantly associated with the trait (at level of 1% nominal P-value and under the 20% threshold of FDR) are illustrated in Additional file . A total of 106 trait-marker combinations were considered to be significant according to 20% FDR criterion. The significant SNPs are listed in Additional file . A total of 69 SNPs from 54 genes had at least one significant association at the P < 0.05 level. For overall leg action  which reflects both FL structural soundness and freedom from other defects affecting the gait  20 SNPs from 15 genes were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) associated with this trait.  was very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated and    and  were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated. Multiple SNPs from  and  were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with overall leg action. For body size traits (length  depth and width)   was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with all three traits and  and  were suggestively (P < 0.1) associated with these traits. The body shape traits (top line  hip structure and rib shape) were involved in the development of long back vertebrae  ribs  hipbones and rump muscles.  and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with top line and  and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with hip structure. All of the SNPs detected from  and  were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with front pasterns  and both SNPs within  were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with front uneven toes. All SNPs within  and  were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with rear pasterns. In addition  it was found that  and  were the common genes suggestively (P < 0.1) associated with front and rear legs turn in/out  and  and  were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with front and rear pasterns. In the same manner   and  were suggestively associated (P < 0.1) with front and rear foot size and  and  were suggestively (P < 0.1) associated with uneven toes of all legs. Among principal components of body conformation  the genes  and  were very highly significantly associated (P < 0.001) with the PC1. Similarly   and  had very highly significant (P < 0.001) association with PC2. The PC1 of FL traits exhibited very highly significant (P < 0.001) associations with  and . The genes  and  were highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with PC2 of FL traits. From the results of association analyses for single trait and PCs   and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated candidate genes for body conformation traits.  and  were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with FL structure soundness traits  and    and  were highly significant (P < 0.01) genes associated with overall leg action in the pig. All four SNPs within  and the two SNPs within  displayed a strong association with the analyzed traits  and these two genes are located adjacent to each other on SSC9  which prompted the haplotype analysis for tag SNP identification. Three major haplotypes  which accounted for 98% of alleles (Figure )  were obtained and were shown as follows  haplotype 1  -ACGACC- (60.9%)  haplotype 2  -CTCGTT- (22.3%) and haplotype 3  -CCGACC- (15%). The association results for each of these three haplotypes are shown in Additional file . There was a highly significant (P < 0.01) difference between individuals carrying haplotype 1 and those without haplotype 1 for traits such as overall leg action  rear pasterns  front pasterns and PC1 of FL structure. The counterpart of haplotype 1  haplotype 2  showed significant (P < 0.05) associations with the above traits. Haplotype 3 was not associated with overall leg action.         . The dbSNP no. for  _01   _02   _01   _02   _03 and  _04 are ss86352086  ss86352087  ss86352109  ss86352112  ss86352113 and ss86352114  respectively. Black boxes indicate  values between 0.9 and 1.0  and light boxes indicate  values less than 0.80.) To our knowledge  this study is the first report on large-scale candidate gene associations with body conformation  FL soundness traits and overall leg action in the pig. The present findings provided a reliable and comprehensive list of candidate genes for further use in fine mapping and biological functional analyses. Population structure is one of important components affecting association and linkage disequilibrium analyses. However  the significant interactions between markers and lines were only found for a very few markers in the study (data was not shown). In addition  the separate linkage disequilibrium pattern and haplotype frequencies were similar for these two lines  as well as the combination of both lines (data was not shown). Therefore  the interaction between marker and line were excluded and was not considered further in the study. Comparative genomic approaches offer an efficient tool for candidate gene identification across closely related species. The accumulating candidate gene findings on human bone related disorders are contributing to studies in pigs. A large number of genes being considered as prospective genes for human bone related disorders were found to be associated with the analyzed traits in the pig. The genes involved in skeletal pattern development such as  and  were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with several important traits (Additional file ). The Wnt/ß-catenin pathway is critical during the development of bone and cartilage tissues.  gene family numbers such as  and - and Wnt associated proteins like frizzed related protein  LRP5 and ß-catenin were proposed to function in bone formation [  ]. In this study   and  showed significant (P < 0.05) associations with one or several body conformation and FL traits. In addition   was highly significantly (P < 0.05) associated with a few of the individual traits such as overall leg action  buck knee  leg turned in/out and the principal components describing feet defects. The Wnt receptor  was very highly (P < 0.001) significantly associated with front foot size. These observations suggest that Wnt signaling should be analyzed further for structural traits in pigs. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) interact with their specific receptors and function in the formation of bone and skeletal patterning. The genes  and  have been considered as inducers during the bone development processing [  ]. Significant associations for  with these traits were not found in this study  but  was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with traits such as overall leg action and front leg pastern. This indicated that the biological functions of  on bones may differ in pigs or exerted at different body locations. Conversely  the very highly significant (P < 0.001) association of  with front pastern posture suggested that the roles it plays in the pig may be similar to humans  since the mutations in this gene were associated with brachydactyli type A2 []. Bone strength and geometry depend on bone matrix and bone mineral density (BMD). The genes implicating BMD variation and multiple epiphyseal dysplasias (MED) like  and  were highly suggestive in humans [  ]. In this study   exhibited a significant (P < 0.05) association with overall leg action and other important traits.  was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with body size traits and principal component denoting body volume. These two genes were associated with human hip osteoarthitis [  ].  was reported to be linked to nodal osteoarthritis [] and it was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with front leg pastern and front uneven toes.  was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with top line and rear leg and feet soundness traits in the pig and it was related to degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis [] and inter-vertebral disc disease [] in humans. These results showed that further studies on these candidate genes  including additional SNP discovery and haplotype analyses  are worthwhile. The genes affecting the functions of bone cells such as  and  exhibited significant association with the analyzed traits in this study (Additional file ). Both  and  are important regulators of bone remodeling  and play essential roles during the osteoclastogenesis and activation of osteoclast [  ]. In this study  one of the two SNPs from  and  was associated with certain traits while the other SNP for each gene showed association with different traits. This implied that the SNPs might be derived from different LD blocks or they have pleiotropic effects.  encodes calcitonin receptor  a 7-transmembrane receptor located on the surface of osteoclasts. Calcitonin activates calcitonin receptor which stimulates adenylate cyclase and leads to the inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption. The polymorphisms of  were related to human BMD and played a role during the pathogenesis of osteoporosis [  ]. Strong associations of multiple SNPs located in intron 9 and 3'UTR with overall leg action and several FL soundness traits suggested that  had significant effects on pig structural soundness and locomotion. Oxytocin receptor mediates oxytocin action through G proteins and activates a phosphatidylinositol- calcium second messenger system. A synonymous mutation in exon 3 of  was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with front and rear leg pasterns and two principal components demonstrating body side profile and leg movement. Hittmeier et al. [] found increased  mRNA expression in bone marrow cells in pigs fed with phosphorus (P) deficient diet  and speculated that  might affect bone growth and turnover through controlling P utilization and  synthesis. The genes related to fat metabolism such as  and  were significantly (P < 0.01) associated with body conformation and FL traits (Additional file ). The connections between human osteoporosis and obesity are being explored in humans. It was also reported that animals with increased fatness usually have positive FL soundness and leg action [  ]. Apolipoprotein E is responsible for accumulating excess fat in adipose tissue [] and adequate lipid content triggers the synthesis and secretion of leptin from adipose tissue into circulation. Leptin further acts on the hypothalamus and releases cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) protein that inhibits bone resorption thus promoting bone strength [  ]. Whereas   negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells and positively promotes adipogenesis resulting in bone loss []. Our studies primarily gave clues that a leptin mediated neuroendocrine bone remodeling may play a key role for different levels of FL structure and body conformation traits in pigs. Earlier QTL mapping studies on FL  leg action and osteochondrosis traits in pigs uncovered the most interesting regions and more than five QTLs were mapped on SSC1  5  7  13 and 16 [  ]. From this study  a number of interesting genes were identified on the above chromosomal regions. For instance QTLs related to FL scores for front and rear legs were mapped between microsatellite  and  and a QTL related to front legs from side-view was mapped around  on SSC1  where both  and  are located. On SSC13  eight QTLs related to FL and gait traits were discovered by different researchers. The genes      and  with significant association seen in this study were between  and  on SSC13 where most of the QTL were mapped. The study also revealed that several prospect genes were not located in the putative chromosomal regions. For instance  the very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated genes such as  and  were on SSC9  where only two QTL were detected. Our findings offered more valuable information for candidate genes selection in addition to those revealed by QTL studies. Strong and highly significant ( > 0.8) LD between  and  was detected. Xiong et al. [] detected five LD blocks comprising of 27 SNPs in human  gene  and found one SNP within 3'UTR was significantly associated with BMD and osteoporosis in the hip. It was suggested that 3'UTR of  might be the most important region for SNP identification. The absence of haplotype 1 in pigs and the presence of its counterpart haplotype 2 favored overall leg action  but was not related to FL soundness traits such as front leg pasterns and rear leg pasterns. The contradictory results might result from the negative phenotypic correlation between overall leg action and these FL traits or the SNPs were located in different LD blocks. More SNPs within  and  are needed for further analysis. Worth noting however  is we did not observe very highly significant (P < 0.001) association of  and  with body conformation  FL soundness traits and overall leg action  even though these two had been considered as important candidate genes for human bone disorders [–]. The reasons might be that a causative SNP has yet to be detected in the current study or they have different biological roles on the traits in the pig. In future work  an in depth-scan of SNPs and haplotype analyses are necessary for confirming the significant genes proposed by this study. Studies on interactions between genes and environments are also needed to better understand the genetic regulation mechanisms on skeleton development and the related disorders in pigs. Feet and leg unsoundness issues have become a growing problem in the swine industry  but few candidate genes related to leg soundness traits have been identified to date. Results from our study provided a reliable and comprehensive list of candidate genes associated with body conformation  FL soundness traits and overall leg action in the pig. The genes      and  were very highly significantly associated with FL structures  and    and  were highly significantly associated with overall leg action. Two genes  and  on SSC9 were in strong linkage disequilibrium  and one haplotype -ACGACC- was highly significantly associated with overall leg action and several important FL soundness traits. These findings motivate future studies in fine mapping and biological functional analyses to verify the effects of these genes. bone mineral density false discovery rate feet and leg linkage disequilibrium minor allele frequency marker assisted selection principal component analysis quantitative trait loci single nucleotide polymorphism un-translated region Johnson DR: The genetics of the skeleton. 1986  New York: Oxford University Press Marks SC  Odgren PR: Structure and development of the skeleton.

Genetic parameters for laying traits were estimated in each environment and the ranking of sire breeding values was compared between environments.

A few sire families showed a good ranking in both environments  suggesting that some families may adapt better to environmental change. In poultry selection programmes  birds are generally raised in a uniform environment to record the selected traits and evaluate genetic values. Thus  most commercial populations are obtained from breeding farms with a controlled environment and are delivered to production farms with variable environments across the world. As a consequence  genotype × environment (GxE) interactions may occur. Under subtropical environments  growth rate as well as egg production are generally depressed by high ambient temperature [  ]. Introduction of some major genes  such as the naked neck () gene  in chicken lines can be used to alleviate heat stress  as discussed in several studies carried out at high ambient temperatures [  –]. Heat tolerance of laying hens is an important issue for the impact of G × E on egg production because the productive period is long and the impact of heat stress increases with the hens' age []. At INRA  a selection experiment was undertaken to improve egg production of brown-egg layers by increasing clutch length  in the presence of two major genes known to improve heat tolerance  the naked neck gene [] and the sex-linked dwarf gene []. After 16 generations  significant genetic progress on egg production was observed in two dwarf lines  one carrying the  gene and one not carrying it [–]. The reduction of feather mass due to the  gene is lower in heterozygous birds than in homozygous birds   27% and 22% respectively for heterozygous females and males  and 41% and 33% respectively for homozygous females and males []. Heat tolerance is significantly improved by the presence of the  gene and significant genotype by temperature interactions were observed for egg production  egg mass and feed intake under a 32°C constant temperature environment  which represents a severe temperature stress []. The purpose of this paper was to study the laying performance in real subtropical conditions of the genotypes obtained from the selection experiment on clutch length  in comparison to the performance in the selection environment. In order to investigate adaptation of hens  genetic parameters for laying traits were estimated in each environment and the ranking of sire breeding values was compared between environments. Two lines of dwarf brown-egg layers established from a common base population in 1985 have been selected on average clutch length for 16 generations. The selection procedure has been described by Chen and Tixier-Boichard []. One line (L1) was normally feathered and the other (L2) was homozygous for the  mutation; a control line segregating for the  mutation was also maintained. In 2001  both selected lines were crossed to produce a new line segregating for the  mutation  which was maintained with a mild selection pressure on average clutch length. In 2003  11 males and 44 females from the control line  and 12 males and 48 females from the newly formed selected line  were used to generate individuals with the three possible genotypes at the  locus  normally feathered ()  heterozygous carriers of the naked neck mutation () or homozygous carriers (). Chicks were obtained in two hatches at a three-week interval for rearing in Taiwan and France  respectively. On November 28  2003  one-day-old chicks were imported to Taiwan. After a 10-day quarantine  they were transferred to the experimental farm of the National Chung-Hsing University. All the chicks were debeaked and reared in floor pens up to 16 weeks. Chicks were vaccinated against the following diseases Marek's disease  fowl pox  Newcastle disease  infectious bronchitis  infectious bursal disease  respiratory enteritic orphan  infectious laryngo-tracheitis  infectious coryza  avian encephalomyelitis and egg drop syndrome. At 17 weeks of age  pullets were housed in individual cages in open house  supplied with ground water and reared in natural daylight. The length of daylight increased gradually from 10.5 to 12 h between ages 4 and 16 weeks and then from 17 weeks of age till the end of the test  a fixed light regimen 14L:10D was applied. This lighting regimen had been used throughout the selection experiment in France and was taken as the reference lighting regimen for the laying period. Water and food were supplied   layer mash contained 18.0% CP and 11.5 MJ ME/kg and temperature and relative humidity were monitored continuously. Figure  shows the curve of daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the chicken house. . (average temperature  22 ± 1°C  during the rearing period in France). On September 18  2003  full-sibs were reared in the experimental farm of INRA  Tours. All chicks were reared in floor pens up to 16 weeks. Chicks were vaccinated against the following diseases: Marek's disease  infectious bronchitis  Gumboro  Newcastle disease and avian encephalomyelitis. At 17 weeks of age  pullets were housed in individual cages in a windowless house with light regimens fixed as 10L:14D and 14L:10D in growth and laying periods  respectively. This lighting regimen had been used since several years for experimental lines in France and was taken as the reference lighting regimen for the laying period. Water and food were supplied . Monthly averages of maximal and minimal temperatures were 25 ± 1°C and 21 ± 1°C  respectively (February to July/18 to 44 weeks of age). Relative humidity ranged from 60 to 80%. Layer mash contained 16.4% CP and 11.2 MJ ME/kg. The egg number (EN) was recorded from the age at first egg (AFE) to 44 weeks of age. For each hen  the laying rate (LR) was obtained from the ratio of egg number (whatever the egg status) to the number of days since the first egg. A break of one day at least between ovipositions was taken as the end of a clutch. The average clutch length (CL) was calculated as the arithmetic mean of all clutches recorded  from the first egg until 44 weeks of age. In addition  egg weight (EW) was obtained at 34 weeks of age (36 weeks in France)  by collecting two eggs per hen laid on consecutive days within a week. The body weights were measured at the entry in the poultry house (BW16) and at adult age (ABW)  34 weeks in Taiwan  and 40 weeks in France. In order to satisfy the classical hypothesis for describing traits with polygenic inheritance via a linear model with normal error  Box-Cox power transformation was used to normalize trait distribution [  ]. The parameters (t) were found to be -0.214  and 1.40 for the transformed value of average clutch length (TCL) and for transformed value of total egg number (TEN)  respectively. The linear model used for the ANOVA of those traits was as follows: Y =  + E + L + G + (E × L) + (ExG) + (L × G) + (E × L × G) + e where Y = individual observation   = overall mean  E = fixed effect of environment  i = 1 to 2  L = fixed effect of line  j = 1 to 2  G = fixed effect of the naked neck genotype  k = 1 to 3  (E × L × G) = fixed effect of the third order interaction between all fixed effects  (E × L) = fixed effect of environment-by-line interaction  (E × G) = fixed effect of genotype-by-environment interaction  (L × G) = fixed effect of line-by-genotype interaction  and e = random error. All analyses were carried with the GLM procedure of the SAS program library []. Means were considered significantly different at P < 0.05. Variance and covariance components were estimated using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedure with the VCE package of Groeneveld []. The following animal model was applied to all traits on the whole data set: =  + + +  where = individual observation for traits   = overall mean  = fixed effect of genotype at the  locus  = random animal effect and = random error. Expectation and variance of the vector of performance    were distributed as follows  in matrix notation: where  = observed performance   = individual additive genetic value  e = residual   = vector of genotype fixed effect   = incidence matrix of vector    = numerator relationship matrix; and  = variance-covariance matrix for the additive genetic effect;  = the number of records  and  = residual variance-covariance matrix for animal . The direct product and direct sum of matrices are indicated by  and   respectively. In order to estimate the genetic correlation between performance measured in the two environments  traits measured in France (F) and Taiwan (T) were treated as distinct BW16 and BW16  the subscript indicating the environment. Because a significant environment-by-line interaction was observed for most of the traits  multi-trait analyses were performed separately for each line. It was not possible to analyse all the traits together because of large computing requirements. Therefore eight analyses with four traits each were implemented in the present study. For instance  concerning body weight traits  one four-trait analysis (BW16  BW16  ABW  ABW) was performed in each line. Sire breeding values were evaluated in each environment for each trait by best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) using a mixed linear model with the PEST package []  with the same model described above. A Spearman correlation analysis was used to compare the sire breeding values obtained either in France or in Taiwan. Total mortality in Taiwan was 22.8% and 23.6% for control and selected lines  respectively  whereas it was below 5% in France. There was no occurrence of epidemic infectious disease in either country. In Taiwan  a hot foehn wind caused a rise in temperature up to 40.3°C during 7 h on July 1. On that day  mortalities were 6.2%  13.6% and 5.5% for    and  genotypes  respectively. During that week  cumulative mortalities were 7.8%  14.6% and 9.4% for each of the three genotypes  respectively. Finally  the experiment included 297 hens in France and 216 hens in Taiwan. The proportion of hens carrying the homozygous  genotype was slightly lower in Taiwan (20–22%) as compared to France (25%). The third order interaction between main effects was never significant  although it was at the limit of significance for egg weight (P < 0.10). There were no significant interactions between the naked neck genotype and either the line or the environment (Table ). The line by environment interaction was highly significant for BW16  clutch length and egg number  with or without Box-Cox transformation (Table ). Body weight differed between lines in Taiwan to a larger extent than in France: the decrease in body weight observed in Taiwan as compared to France was stronger for the selected line. Clutch length and egg number were smaller in Taiwan and to a larger extent for the selected line  the decrease in average clutch length  the selected trait  was 26.6% (3.19 vs. 2.34) and 59.4% (13.89 vs. 5.64) in the control and the selected lines  respectively. However  performance of the selected line still remained much higher than that of the control line in both environments. The naked neck genotype had a significant effect on body weight at 16 weeks (BW16)  age at first egg (AFE) and egg weight (EW) (Table ). Homozygous naked neck hens had a lower BW16 and a higher AFE  except in the control line in France. They also exhibited a larger EW  but the difference was significant only for the control line in France  and for the selected line in Taiwan (Tables  and ). Thus  the  gene limited the negative impact of the change in environment on egg weight in the selected line. All traits were significantly influenced by environment and line. For all traits  the performance measured in France was better than the performance obtained in Taiwan. In France  the mean values for CL  EN and LR were respectively 3.19 (untransformed)  120 (untransformed)  and 66.9 in the control line and 13.17 (untransformed)  163 (untransformed)  and 89.4 in the selected line. In Taiwan  the average clutch length was 2.34 and 5.64 (untransformed values) for the control and selected lines  respectively. After normalization by Box-Cox transformation  the relative decrease of average clutch length in Taiwan was similar for both lines and close to -30% except for the normally feathered hens in the control line  but  in absolute values  the decrease was larger in the higher performing line After normalization  the total egg number in Taiwan as compared to France was even more reduced (by about 40%) as a result of the increase in age at first egg observed in Taiwan (by about 15%). Laying rate was reduced by 20% in Taiwan in both lines. Comparison of the laying curves obtained in France and Taiwan (Figures  and ) showed differences due to a delayed onset of lay  a lower peak of egg production with a slightly better persistency of lay until the age of 44 weeks. There was a three-week delay of the onset of lay for both lines in Taiwan and  in the selected line  the homozygous  genotype reached the peak of egg production later  but this was not significant in the control line. . . Feed consumption was measured between 31 and 34 weeks of age in Taiwan only. There were no significant differences between lines (2163 vs 2267 for control line vs selection line)  or among genotypes (2171  2281  2219 for      genotypes). Estimates of heritability and genetic correlations between traits measured in the two environments are shown in Table  for each line. Heritability values estimated for the selected line were generally higher for traits measured in France and the difference was noticeable for body weight  egg number  laying rate and egg weight. Heritability values obtained in Taiwan for the selected line were very low for egg number and laying rate. Since in most cases  the estimated heritability values exhibited larger asymptotic errors for the control line than for the selected line (because of a limited number of animals)  the differences in estimates between the two environments were not as remarkable. However  in some cases high values were obtained  for normalized clutch length  which showed a higher estimated heritability in Taiwan (0.91) than in France (0.57). Genetic correlations between traits measured in the two environments for the selected line were high and not different from 1 for body weight and egg weight (from 0.82 to 0.96); values were lower and much less accurate for egg laying traits  so that it may be suggested that most of these correlations were null; only age at first egg exhibited a reasonably low asymptotic error  supporting the hypothesis that the correlation did not differ from zero. A different picture was observed for the control line: the highest correlation was observed for clutch length in both environments and was very close to 1  whereas correlations obtained for egg number  laying rate and body weight ranged from 0.34 to 0.48. Actually  correlations for body weight  egg weight and age at first egg were rather lower than in the selected line and exhibited the largest standard errors of all estimates for the control line  suggesting that they may not differ from zero. The Spearman rank correlations of sire breeding values estimated between the two environments are listed in Table  together with their probability values. Most of these correlations were not significant but some differences between lines may be pointed out. Correlations for egg production traits (clutch length  egg number) were moderate to high in the control line (0.72 to 0.88) and differed significantly from zero  whereas they did not differ from zero in the selected line. On the opposite  correlations for body weight and egg weight were higher in the selected line (0.48 to 0.70) than in the control line; the correlation was significant for egg weight in the selected line but not in the control line. The correlation for age at first egg was low and non significant in both lines. The effect of environment was quite large. The performances of all traits were lower in Taiwan and mortality was very high for both lines. Since there was no outbreak of infectious disease  this high level of mortality is rather difficult to explain. It may be due to the cumulated effect of several environmental and husbandry factors differing between France and Taiwan  which affected lines to a similar extent. For instance  these lines are never debeaked in France. To our knowledge  it has never been reported that debeaking has an effect on feed intake and behaviour in dwarf brown-egg layers. Since hens were housed in individual cages  debeaking was not expected to influence performance greatly. A significant interaction between environments and lines was found for laying traits  which indicated that the selected line was more sensitive to environmental changes than the control line for production level. Thus  performance level influenced the adaptation of laying hens. However  it should be noted that  in Taiwan  the selected line maintained a higher performance for laying rate than the control line. Among the main differences between the two environments  ambient temperature  lighting regimen and diet composition are discussed in more detail below. Concerning ambient temperature  a favourable effect on hens' adaptation was expected with the naked neck gene. Indeed  at a constant ambient temperature of 32°C  the  gene has been shown to limit the negative effect of long-term heat stress on egg production and feed efficiency traits []  because of its effect on sensible heat loss  which is increased due to lower feather cover [  ]. In the present study  the average daily minimum and maximum temperatures ranged between 24.1°C to 32.4°C during the laying period. However  there was no significant effect of the naked neck genotype on laying traits and no interaction between naked neck genotype and environment. This suggests that the naturally cycling temperature was not so stressful for laying hens. In broilers  chickens exposed to temperature cycling over a wide range of 24°C – 35°C  exhibit a similar growth rate to that recorded in birds exposed to a constant temperature []. Furthermore  the  gene was not expected to influence adaptation to other husbandry factors than temperature  such as lighting or feed composition. Indeed  since all these factors differed between France and Taiwan  the resulting effect of the  gene could not be identical to the effect observed when only the temperature factor was changed. This study suggests that ambient temperature is not the main driving factor of adaptation of layers to subtropical environments in experimental conditions. Concerning lighting regimen  it has been shown to play a very important role in the onset of sexual maturity. A constant or decreasing amount of daily light will delay sexual maturity in growing birds. Indeed  in the present study  the amount of daily light in Taiwan decreased during the rearing period  which probably explains the three-week delay for the onset of lay observed in both lines. The control line exhibited the highest values for onset of lay  as previously reported []. The delay appeared to be longer for the naked neck hens in both lines  which may also be due to the lower body weight observed with this genotype in Taiwan and in France for the selected line only. Chen and Tixier-Boichard [] have already observed this effect of the naked neck gene on sexual maturity for the same dwarf lines. Concerning feed composition  the higher protein percentage used in Taiwan is expected to have a positive effect on egg weight []  but this is not what we observed. Since egg weight is generally strongly correlated to body weight  the negative effect of the subtropical environment on body weight is probably the main explanation for the lower egg weight observed in Taiwan. Changes in environment affected genetic parameters to a larger extent in the selected line than in the control line. In the selected line  the estimated heritabilities exhibited higher values for performance recorded in France than in Taiwan  which could be explained by the large environmental variability in Taiwan. Coefficients of variation for clutch length  egg number and laying rate were much larger in Taiwan than in France for the selected line except for the homozygous naked neck hens; the same trend was observed  with a lower magnitude  in the control line (Table ). Coefficients of variation were generally smaller and remained more stable between environments for body weight  egg weight and sexual maturity in both lines (Table ). The heritability values for AFE (0.49)  TEN (0.32) and LR (0.27) obtained for the selected line in France were close to estimates previously published for the same population []. For the selected trait TCL and traits strongly correlated with it (egg number and laying rate)  heritability values were higher in the control line  whatever the environment  which is consistent with the decrease in genetic variance due to past selection. This suggests that selection to improve laying performance in Taiwan may be difficult in the selected line. Estimating genetic correlations between traits measured in two environments is one approach to reveal within-line genotype × environment (G × E) interactions []. Correlations significantly lower than 1 indicate the occurrence of GxE interactions. Our results indicate that G × E interactions are more important for laying traits than for body weight and egg weight in the selected line but absent for clutch length in the control line. This is consistent with the fact that the highest performing line was more susceptible to environmental change. Concerning age at first egg  very low correlations were observed in both lines  which were similarly affected by the difference in lighting regimen. Rank correlations between sire breeding values  calculated for 9 and 12 sires from control and selected lines respectively show no correlation for egg production traits in the selected line  and positive but moderate correlations for body weight and egg weight. The situation is almost opposite in the control line  with a significantly positive correlation for egg production traits and low to moderate correlations for body weight and egg weight. Similarly  rank correlation results confirm genetic correlations results. This emphasizes the high impact of GxE interaction on the within-line selection process that should not be ignored in a breeding program. Within the selected line  a few sires (sire 19 and 16) showed a good ranking in both environments for the selected trait  clutch length (Table ) suggesting that it may be possible to identify some families with a better adaptation capacity to environmental changes. Breeders regularly mention the importance of GxE interactions within commercial lines  but data obtained for similar families in contrasted environments  as shown here  are generally not published. Use of a control line  derived from the same base population as the selected line  clearly shows that the sensitivity to a new environment  particularly subtropical climate  is increased by past selection. This greater sensitivity is associated with a decrease in heritability of selected traits. Regular testing of a given line across various environments  and integrating such data in the evaluation programme could monitor this impact. Considering the current predictions on future climate changes  this result shows that the components of adaptation to real subtropical conditions need to be better identified in order to anticipate the negative consequences on the climate change. Indeed  the heat tolerance described for naked neck layers in experimental conditions was not found to particularly improve adaptation to the naked neck layers in Taiwan. Identification of a few sire families capable of achieving a good performance in both environments  temperate and subtropical  suggests that selection for improved adaptation capacity may be feasible. However  a large genetic base will be necessary to identify a sufficiently large number of sires to start a selection programme. Other differences between selected lines  not included in the present study  may also have an influence and should be investigated in the future.

This opens great opportunities for genetic improvement of purebreds for performance of their crossbred descendents in the field  without the need to track pedigrees through the system. One of the main limitations of many livestock breeding programs is that selection is in purebred nucleus lines or breeds that are housed in high-health environments but the goal of selection is to improve crossbred performance under field conditions. Due to genetic differences between purebreds and crossbreds and environmental differences between nucleus and field conditions  performance of purebred parents can be a poor predictor of performance of their crossbred descendants []. Furthermore  some important traits such as disease resistance cannot be measured in nucleus lines. In order to avoid these problems  it has been proposed to select purebred relatives based on crossbred performance using combined crossbred and purebred selection or CCPS [–]. This approach can increase response to selection for crossbred performance relative to the classical method of selection on purebred performance []. It has  however  not been extensively implemented in livestock due mainly to the difficulty and cost of routine collection of phenotypic and pedigree data from crossbreds in the field []. In addition  using CCPS increases the rate of inbreeding [] and makes it difficult to accommodate non-additive gene action []. As an alternative to CCPS  Dekkers [] proposed to select purebreds for commercial crossbred performance using genomic selection. In livestock  genomic selection is becoming increasingly feasible because of the availability of massive numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. This approach consists of predicting breeding values on the basis of a larger number of SNPs [–]  utilizing linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and the QTL. Genomic selection of purebreds for crossbred performance involves estimating effects of SNPs on crossbred performance  using phenotypes and SNP genotypes evaluated on crossbreds  and applying the resulting estimates to SNP genotypes obtained on purebreds (Dekkers 2007). Genomic selection for crossbred performance has three main advantages over CCPS: 1) it does not require pedigree information on crossbreds  2) after estimates of SNP effects are obtained using genotype and phenotype data  prediction can continue for several generations without additional phenotypes []  3) it reduces the rate of inbreeding []  and 4) it makes accommodating non-additive gene action easier []. The success of genomic selection depends mainly on the prediction accuracy of the estimated breeding values (GEBVs). Several authors have studied the accuracy of these predictions by computer simulation [    ]. However  these studies have focused on pure breeds. In crossbred populations  effects of SNPs may be breed specific because the extent of LD between SNPs and QTL can differ between breeds. Moreover  the LD may not be restricted to markers that are tightly linked to the QTL. Both these problems could be addressed by using a model with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles. Toosi et al. [] evaluated simulated training populations consisting of crosses or mixtures of breeds and found the accuracy of genomic selection to be lower compared to using purebred data for training  but not by a large degree. They  however  used a genomic selection model in which SNP allele effects were assumed the same in all breeds. Thus  the objective of this study was to compare by computer simulation the accuracy of genomic selection of purebreds for commercial crossbred performance  using either the classical genomic selection model with across-breed effects of SNP genotypes (ASGM) or a model with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM). In all simulations  the genome consisted of one chromosome of 1 Morgan with 6000 SNPs and 30 biallelic QTL. A gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters equal to 0.4 and 1/1.66 was used to sample the absolute value of effects of the QTL. The sign of the QTL effect was sampled to be positive or negative with probability 0.5. Effects were rescaled to result in a genetic variance equal to 1.0. The phenotypic trait was simulated under additive gene action. Dominance and epistatic effects were not simulated but would be captured to the extent that they are incorporated in allele substitution effects (see discussion). In the base population  SNP and QTL alleles were sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with frequency 0.5. A mutation rate of 2.5 × 10 per generation was applied in the following generations for all loci  where mutations switched the allele state from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1. Recombinations on a chromosome were modeled according to a binomial map function []. Three scenarios for breed history were considered in this study. In the first two scenarios  the breeds were assumed to have a common origin either 50 or 550 generations ago. In the third scenario  the breeds did not have a common origin. These scenarios will be referred to as having closely related breeds  distantly related breeds  and unrelated breeds  respectively. In all cases LD was simulated by drift and mutation in two periods. In the first period of 1000 generations  random mating was simulated in an effective population of size 500. In the second period of 50 generations  random mating continued after reducing the effective population size to 100. In generation 1051 the population size was expanded to 1000 or 4000 individuals simulating more matings and seven more generations of random mating with the expanded population size were produced. Also  in generation 1051 three different commercial crossbred lines were generated with 1000 or 4000 individuals. These crossbred lines were an AxB two-breed cross  an ABxC three-breed cross  and an ABxCD four-breed cross. The crossbred lines in generation 1051 were used for \"training\" with phenotype and genotype data  and the purebred lines in generation 1058 for validation with only genotype data. Either 500 or 2000 segregating SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05) from the crossbred population were chosen for analysis. Some of these segregating SNPs in the crossbred populations were fixed in the purebred populations. Heritability of the quantitative trait was set to 0.3 by rescaling QTL effects in the training population. The method to estimate SNP effects was Bayes-B []  which is described further in the following. The criterion to compare models was the accuracy of estimated breeding values for the purebred validation population  calculated as the correlation between true and estimated breeding values. Each simulated data set and analysis was replicated 40 times. The statistical models used for the analyses are described here. The across-breed SNP genotype model (ASGM) is: where is the phenotype of    is the overall mean  (0  1  or 2) is the genotype of  at marker locus   is the across-breed allele substitution effect of locus  in the training population  is a 0/1 indicator variable that specifies if locus  is included in the model or not  and is the residual of . The breed-specific SNP allele model (BSAM) is: where  (0 1) is the SNP allele at locus   of breed origin  that  received from its sire   is the breed-specific substitution effect for allele . If the sire of  is a purebred   takes the same value for all alleles  e.g.  = 1 if the sire is purebred A. On the other hand  if the sire is crossbred  AxB for example   can take values 1 or 2  indicating whether the SNP allele received for the sire originated from breed A or B. The variable    is a 0/1 indicator that specifies if the sire allele is included in the model for locus . Similarly      and  are defined for the SNP allele at locus   of origin  that  received from its dam. Breed origin of alleles was assumed to be known without error in the analyses. The Bayes-B method described by Meuwissen et al. [] was used to estimate the across-breed additive effects in ASGM and the breed-specific additive effects in BSAM. The prior probability for a locus to be included in the model was set to 0.05  i.e.  Pr(= 1) = 0.05. A previous study of prior sensitivity was performed to validate that it did not influence in the model results. For loci in the model  the locus effects were assumed to be normal with null mean and locus specific variance  in ASGM  and locus and breed-origin specific variance  and  for BSAM. Following Meuwissen et al. []  the prior for these variance components was an inverse chi-square with 4.234 degrees of freedom and scale parameter  = 0.0429. The prior for the  was an inverse chi-square distribution with four degrees of freedom and scale parameter  = 0.4  and a flat prior was used for . A difference between the Bayes-B implementation of Meuwissen et al. [] and that used here is that we fitted effects of SNP genotypes and alleles rather than of haplotypes. After some exploratory analyses  a single chain of 100 000 samples was used  with a burn-in period of 1000. Convergence was tested for all dispersion parameters separately using the Raftery and Lewis [] method and a visual check of the chain plots. Accuracy of prediction of breeding values in the purebred lines using ASGM and BSAM are in Tables    and . Results when the AxB two-breed cross was used as training population are in Table . In this table  the accuracy of both models (ASGM and BSAM) increased with marker density and size of the training data. Accuracies of both models also tended to decrease with increasing distance between breeds. The effect of marker density  training data size and distance between breeds  however  differed between the two models  which resulted in the model with the highest accuracy to differ between scenarios. Given the differences in marker-QTL LD  we would have expected the model that fitted breed-specific SNP allele effects (BSAM) to have greater accuracy. However  that was the case only when the number of markers was small (500)  the number of records used for training was large (4000)  and when breeds were distantly related or unrelated. When the number of markers was increased to 2000  ASGM gave better results when breeds were closely related  and the difference in accuracy was significant in the simulation with 1000 records. For distant or unrelated breeds  BSAM had accuracies that were equal to or better than those with ASGM. As a reference  accuracy of predicting breeding value in a purebred line when training was in the same line is given in Table . These results are almost identical to those in Table  for closely related breeds. Accuracies of the best model in the cross are  however  lower for distant and unrelated breeds. Results when the ABxC three-breed cross was used as the training population are in Table . In this scenario  50% of the alleles in the training population are from breed C but only 25% are from either breed A or B. Thus  accuracies are given in this table for predicting breeding values of B and C purebred animals. In all cases and for both models  accuracies were lower for breed B than for breed C  as expected. Also  general trends in accuracies for a given model with changes in marker density  data size  and breed distance were similar as observed for the two-way cross in Table . The relative performance of the two models  however  differed from what was observed for the two-way cross. For the three-way cross (Table )  with closely related breeds  ASGM gave better results when 1000 records were used  and with the exception of predicting purebred B animals using 500 markers  all these differences were significant. For close breeds  when 4000 records were used for training  ASGM was significantly better only for predicting purebred C animals using 2000 markers. For distant or unrelated breeds  ASGM was significantly better than BSAM for predicting purebred C animals using 2000 markers and 1000 records for training. When the number of records for training was increased to 4000  BSAM was significantly better for predicting purebred B animals using 500 markers in scenario 2  but ASGM was better for predicting purebred B animals using 500 markers in scenario 3 and for predicting purebred C animals using 2000 markers in scenarios 2 and 3. Results when the ABxCD four-breed cross was used as the training population are in Table . Because the same accuracy is expected for all breeds  since all contribute 25% to the cross  only accuracy for one breed is shown. Here  BSAM was significantly better when 500 markers were used with 4000 records for training for distant or unrelated breeds. However  ASGM was significantly better when 2000 markers were used with 1000 records for training for close breeds and with 4000 records for training for unrelated breeds. Figure  shows the frequency of SNP alleles for purebreds A and B in generation 1050 for unrelated breeds. This figure shows that a large number of loci that were segregating in one of the purebred lines were fixed in the other purebred line. For these loci that are fixed in one of the purebred lines  ASGM and BSAM are equivalent. This partially explains why differences between ASGM and BSAM were small for unrelated breeds.                                                  To further investigate the impact of the genetic difference between breeds on the accuracy of genomic selection based on crossbred data  Figure  plots the difference in average genotypic values of the two breeds against the accuracy of breeding values predicted based on their crossbred data. Each point represents one replicate for the scenario with distantly related breeds  2000 SNPs  and 1000 records. Although in general high accuracies were obtained for genotype differences smaller than 4 sd  the small number of samples with breed differences greater than 4 sd was not enough to disclose a clear relationship between breed difference and accuracy.  Each point represents one replicate for the scenario with distantly related breeds  2000 SNPs  and 1000 records. The results presented above were based on a simulated genome consisting of only 1 chromosome of 1 M. To compare these results with a more realistic situation  we simulated the scenario for closely related breeds with a genome of 10 chromosomes with a total genome size of 10 M  60 000 SNPs and 1 000 QTL. For the statistical analysis we chose 20 000 segregating SNPs from the crossbred population. The analysis of this data showed a 25% drop in of accuracy relative to the results with 1 chromosome. However  the relationship between training in a purebred line or crossbred line did not change (Table ). The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of genomic selection of purebreds for commercial crossbred performance using either ASGM or BSAM. Alleles in a crossbred line originate from one of the purebred parental lines. If these purebred lines are not closely related  the effect of SNP alleles will depend on their line of origin. Thus  a model with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM) was used to estimate the effects of alleles in purebreds for crossbred performance. These estimated effects and the SNP genotypes of purebred candidates for selection were then used to predict their breeding values for crossbred performance. The accuracy of prediction was quantified by the correlation of the predicted and true breeding values. This accuracy was compared to that obtained using the classical model with across breed effects of SNP genotypes (ASGM). Due to the genetic differences among the pure lines  BSAM with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles was expected to perform better. Contrary to expectation  however  accuracy of prediction with ASGM often was equal to or higher than with BSAM. In addition to the relationship between the purebred parental lines  there are two other factors that contribute to the difference in accuracy of prediction using ASGM and BSAM in our simulations. Marker density is one of these  and the other is the number of records used in training. Marker density affects the difference between ASGM and BSAM in two ways. The first is that as marker density increases the model will include markers that are closer to the QTL. In a finite population  marker alleles that are closer to the QTL will more accurately reflect the state of the QTL alleles. Thus  as the marker density increases the need for BSAM is reduced. The second is that BSAM has  relative to ASGM  twice as many effects that need to be estimated in a two-breed cross  three times as many in a three-breed cross  and four times as many in a four-breed cross. Thus  due to the greater number of effects that need to be estimated  BSAM is at a disadvantage over ASGM  and this disadvantage increases with marker density. On the other hand  as the number of records used for training increases more information becomes available to estimate the effects of markers and  given sufficient records for training  even small differences in breeds will make BSAM advantageous. So  BSAM will give better results only when breed differences are big enough to compensate for the additional breed-specific effects in the model  given the number of records used for training. Note that in the absence of epistasis  there are no breed differences for effects at the QTL. Thus  as the marker density increases  breed differences of markers effects decreases while the number of extra parameters in BSAM increases. In Table   BSAM had greater accuracy when 500 markers were used  but when the number of markers was increased to 2000  this advantage disappeared except when breeds were unrelated and  thus  breed differences were greatest. The effect of increasing the number of records used for training can be seen from Tables       where given the same number of markers  increasing the number of records used tended to favor BSAM. In Table   for example  the difference in accuracy between ASGM and BSAM was not significant with 500 markers for distantly related breeds when 1000 records were used for training  but when the number of records for training was increased to 4000  BSAM was significantly more accurate  with the difference in accuracies between ASGM and BSAM changing from 0.02 to -0.11. Our results include several such examples where increasing the number of records favors BSAM (Tables     )  but none that goes in the opposite direction. This demonstrates that BSAM will have an advantage provided sufficient information is available for estimating the additional breed-specific effects. In livestock  production animals often are either from a three-breed or four-breed cross. When an ABxC three-breed cross was used for training  the accuracy of prediction of purebred C animals was about the same as the accuracy of prediction of purebred B animals with training in an AxB two-breed cross. This is because 50% of the alleles in the ABxC cross are from purebred line C. On the other hand  only 25% of the alleles in ABxC are from purebred line B. Thus  the accuracy of prediction for line B animals was significantly lower. The same was true in a four-breed cross  where only 25% of the alleles in the crossbreds are from any particular parental line. Thus  the accuracy of prediction of purebred B animals with training in an ABxCD cross was similar in accuracy to that for purebred B animals with training in an ABxC cross (Tables  and ). It is interesting that the accuracy of prediction with training in a four-breed cross using 4000 records was about the same as that with training in a purebred line with 1000 records (Tables  and ). The results in Table  show that  given the same number of records used for training  when marker effects from 10 chromosomes were included in the model  the accuracy of prediction dropped. Table  showed that when the model included 2000 markers from one chromosome  ASMG was significantly more accurate than BSAM. When the model includes 20 000 markers from 10 chromosomes  the difference in accuracy became smaller but remained significant (Table ). Dominance and epistatic effects were not considered in the present study. However  the genomic selection methods for crossbred performance do not require absence of non-additive effects. If non-additive effects are present  the marker effects estimated by the genomic selection methods are allele substitution effects  which incorporate the additive components of dominance and epistatic effects []. Thus  by estimating allele substitution effects based on crossbred phenotypes  the effects of purebred alleles will be estimated against the genetic background that they will be expressed in. Thus  genomic selection on SNP effects estimated on crossbred data is equivalent to practicing reciprocal recurrent selection. The simulation model also assumed absence of genotype by environment interactions. Such interactions could  however  be present when comparing performance in nucleus and field environments and contribute to the low genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performance that have been estimated in literature. However  similar to non-additive effects  allele substitution effects estimated based on phenotypes collected in the field would allow the effects of purebred alleles to be estimated under the environment in which they will be expressed. Although genomic selection models accommodate non-additive effects to the extent that they are captured by allele substitution effects  presence of non-additive effects can reduce the accuracy of GEBV compared to those obtained here  and also affect the comparison between the ASGM and BSAM models. The reason is that non-additive effects will increase differences in breed-specific allele substitution effects because breeds are expected to differ in allele frequencies at QTL. Specifically  with dominance  the QTL allele substitution effect for breed A on performance of AxB crossbreds is equal to a+d(1-2pB)  where pB is the QTL allele frequency in breed B and a and d are the additive and dominance effects at the QTL []. Thus  if breeds that are being crossed have different QTL allele frequencies  they will have different allele substitution effects at the QTL and  therefore also at markers that are in LD with the QTL. Epistatic effects also contribute to allele substitution effects  depending on allele frequencies. Thus  if epistatic effects are present  allele substitution effects will further differ between breeds. These additional differences in breed-specific SNP effects compared to what was simulated here will likely increase the accuracy of the BSAM model that includes breed-specific allele effects compared to the ASGM model. The accuracy of the ASGM model will likely decrease slightly  as the average allele effects across breeds will tend to be reduced when differences in breed-specific allele effects are greater. Further work is needed to investigate these scenarios. Presence of genotype by environment interactions for the nucleus versus field environment are not expected to affect the accuracy of either the ASGM or BSAM model because allele effects are evaluated in the target environment for both models. In this study  divergence between breeds was created by drift only. In practice  in addition to drift  breeds will have diverged as a result of different selection pressures imposed upon them through either artificial or natural selection. The potential impact of differential artificial selection on the trait being evaluated is indirectly evaluated in Figure  by considering breed pairs that have drifted apart to differing degrees for average genotypic values for the trait. As shown in the Figure  this did not have a discernible effect on the accuracy of genomic selection. The same is expected to hold for breeds that have been differentially selected for other characteristics. Results from this study show the potential for genomic selection of purebreds for commercial crossbred performance. This would enable genetic improvement of purebreds for performance of their crossbred descendents in the field  without the need to track pedigrees through the system. Further  these results indicate that a model with breed-specific effects of alleles may not be necessary  especially when the marker density is high. It is obvious that ASGM would be better when breeds are not very different. However  in some cases ASGM was significantly better even when the breeds did not have any common origin (Table ). The reason for this can be seen from figure . There are three types of loci in this figure: ) those that are segregating in both lines  2) those that are segregating only in one line  and those that are fixed in both lines. Loci of the first type would favor BSAM  those of the second type would contribute equally to both models  and those of the third type would not contribute to either. Crosses of highly inbred lines that were separated in the distant past will have only a few loci of the first type and thus  would not favor BSAM over ASGM. So  even in this extreme case  ASGM can do well. Using ASGM has the advantage that it does not require tracing alleles from crossbreds in the field to their purebred ancestors in nucleus lines. In this study  we assumed that alleles could be traced from the crossbreds to the purebred parents without error. Given very high density marker information  it may be possible to trace alleles to ancestors very accurately []  but some errors may be inevitable. Thus  in practice  ASGM may even perform relatively better than in this study. Dekkers JCM: Marker-assisted selection for commercial crossbred performance.

Our conclusion is that different optimal window sizes should be used in QTL-mapping versus genome-wide breeding value prediction. The use of genome-wide dense marker maps in animal breeding is becoming more common for both genome-wide breeding value prediction and QTL detection. In genome-wide breeding value prediction  the simplest model assumes that each allele of a marker locus has an effect on the trait of interest  . that a simple regression on single or multiple SNP markers can be used as predictive model for the breeding value. Alternatively  haplotypes can be constructed using marker alleles of two or more loci on the same chromosome. In this type of analysis  haplotypes are associated to the phenotypic values  and the summation of all haplotype effects gives the genomic breeding value of an animal. Using the haplotype approach  different assumptions can be made about relationships between haplotypes. For example  one option is to assume that a specific haplotype has a one to one relation with the same QTL allele independently of the individual that carries the haplotype [. []]. Alternatively  identical-by-descent probabilities (IBD) between marker haplotypes can be used to allow for non zero relationships between haplotypes and relationships less than unity between two identical marker haplotypes carried by different individuals [. []]. For example  a smaller than unity IBD probability between identical haplotypes can be explained by the fact that marker alleles are inherited from different ancestors. Using both haplotypes and IBD probabilities in the analysis has the advantage that not only population-wide linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL  but also within family linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL is taken into account. These different models have proven to be important for the prediction of genomic breeding values. Including multiple markers per haplotype and IBD information  with a moderate marker density generally yields more accurate results than models that include haplotypes based on two marker alleles but not relations between haplotypes  or models that include marker alleles instead of haplotypes []. Also  in applications for QTL fine-mapping  the differences in models have been investigated. It has been shown that using a reduced number of marker alleles in a haplotype based IBD method  yields higher mapping accuracy than using all available marker alleles in haplotypes []. An important question is what is the effect of the number of included markers in haplotypes on the accuracy of predicted breeding values. Furthermore  in contrast to the results obtained by predicting breeding values  it has been shown that for QTL mapping regression on single marker alleles can compete with haplotype based methods using IBD []. One factor that might play an important role in this comparison is the number of effects that needs to be estimated in the model. It has been shown that a model including both haplotypes based on multiple markers and relationships between them  yields ~25 to 500 times as many effects that need to be estimated as a model based on single marker alleles []. Reducing the number of haplotypes reduces the degrees of freedom used in the model  which produces increased power in association studies []. If reducing the number of effects in the model is an important factor for accurately estimating QTL  then reducing the number of haplotypes by clustering haplotypes that are strongly related to each other [  ]  might be another option to improve the accuracy of QTL detection. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of haplotype definition on the accuracy of predicted breeding values for genomic selection and on the precision of QTL mapping  given a moderately dense marker map and using simulated data. Various haplotype definitions were tested in the IBD-based multiple QTL model by changing the number of surrounding marker alleles used per haplotype and the degree of haplotypes clustering together depending on their IBD probability (> 0.55  0.75 and 0.95). For each replicate  an effective population size of 100 animals was simulated for 1 000 generations. Each next generation was formed by generating 100 offspring (50 males and 50 females)  their parents selected at random from the current generation. To reduce calculation time  the simulated genomes comprised three chromosomes of 1 Morgan each. The positions of 7 500 QTL and 50 000 marker loci were simulated randomly across the genome. In the first generation  all QTL and marker loci had an allele coded as 1. The probability of having a recombination between two adjacent loci on the same chromosome was calculated using Haldane's mapping function based on the distance between the loci. In generation 1 through 1000  on average 50 markers and 7.5 QTL mutations per generation were simulated  yielding mutated alleles coded as 2. Each locus had one mutation during the 1000 generations. The initial numbers of marker and QTL loci were determined based on the number of loci that were still polymorphic in generation 1000 in preliminary analyses  targeting respectively ~400 polymorphic SNP and 80 polymorphic QTL on the 3 Morgan genomes. Because 1000 generations of random mating were simulated  linkage disequilibrium (LD) could arise between marker and QTL loci due to random genetic drift  as shown in other studies [        ]. This arisen LD between marker and QTL loci provided associations between QTL loci and marker haplotypes as a result of population history []. All original QTL alleles were assumed to have no influence on the considered trait. All mutated QTL alleles received an effect drawn from a gamma distribution (with a shape parameter of 0.4 and scale parameter of 1.0)  with an equal chance of being positive or negative according to Meuwissen . []. The gamma distribution ensured that a large number of QTL had small effects  while a small number of QTL had large effects and explained much of the genetic variance  as shown for QTL in livestock [  ]. Three additional generations (1001 to 1003) were simulated in which no mutations occurred. The simulated additive genetic variance at each locus  () was calculated using allele frequencies calculated from those three additional generations  using the formula  =  []  where  is the allele frequency of one of both alleles at a QTL locus  and  is the allele substitution effect. The total simulated genetic variance () was obtained by summing up the variance across all QTL loci  assuming no correlation between QTL. To obtain a heritability of 0.50  the residuals were drawn from a random distribution (0  ). All animals in generations 1001 and 1002 received one phenotypic record  obtained by adding a random residual to the true breeding value of the animals. All phenotypic records were scaled such that the phenotypic variance was 1.0. Generation 1001 comprised 100 animals. Generation 1002 comprised 1000 animals  meaning that animals of generation 1001 on average had 20 offspring  whereas parents of previous generations on average had two offspring. The generation 1002 produced one more generation of 1000 offspring. Thus  1100 animals (generations 1001 and 1002) with known phenotypes and genotypes were simulated  as well as 1000 juvenile animals with unknown phenotypes and known genotypes (generation 1003). The general model to estimate the haplotype effects at  putative QTL loci in the simulated dataset was: where is the phenotypic record of animal    is the average phenotypic performance  is the random polygenic effect for animal   is the direction of the haplotype effects at a putative QTL position   () is the size of the QTL effect for the paternal (maternal) haplotype of animal  at locus  (of  putative QTL loci) of animal   and is a random residual for animal . Gibbs sampling was used for the analysis  using a Gauss Seidel iteration on data solving scheme together with simultaneous variance component estimation  as recommended by Legarra and Misztal [] for genome-wide breeding value prediction. The Gibbs sampling process included sampling of the presence of a QTL at each considered putative QTL position. Putative QTL loci were considered at the midpoint of each pair of adjacent markers on the same chromosome  following Meuwissen and Goddard []. Hence  when  markers were simulated across the three chromosomes  -3 putative QTL positions were considered. For each putative QTL locus  haplotypes were defined using different numbers of surrounding markers  as explained in the next section. For simplicity  linkage phases of marker alleles were assumed to be known without error. Between all the haplotypes at the same locus  the probability of being IBD was calculated  combining linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis information. The IBD probabilities between haplotypes of the first generation of genotyped animals  were predicted using a simplified coalescence process  with the assumptions that 100 generations were between the current and base population and that the effective population size during those 100 generations was 100. The calculated IBD matrix for the base haplotypes was inverted. Whenever one of the eigenvalues of the matrix after clustering (which is described in the next section) was smaller than 0.0  . when the matrix was not positive definite  the matrix was bended by adding  + 0.01 to all the diagonal elements  where  is the absolute value of the lowest (negative) eigenvalue. Haplotypes of animals in later generations were added to the inverted IBD matrices using the recursive formulas as described by Fernando and Grossman []. A full description of the method to predict the IBD probabilities is given by Meuwissen and Goddard []. The IBD-matrix was used to model the covariances between haplotypes. The covariance among polygenic effects was estimated as A ×   where A is the additive genetic relationship matrix based on the pedigree of the last four generations of animals and  is the polygenic variance. The estimated haplotype variance at each locus was calculated as H ×   where H is the heterozygosity of clustered haplotypes in the analysed population and  is the estimated posterior haplotype variance for the base population.  was considered to be equal to the estimated variance of × . The (co)variance of haplotypes at locus  () was modelled by the IBD matrix for locus . Since diagonal elements of the IBD matrix have a value of 1.0  the model restricted to have a variance of 1 []  and therefore  was calculated as . The formula H ×  is analogous to the formula  where  is the heterozygosity at a biallelic locus and  is the allele substitution effect []  and also analogous to the calculation of an additive genetic variance as (1-) ×  where  is the inbreeding in the current population. In our situation  we assumed that animals were unrelated in the considered base population (100 generations ago)  meaning that in the base population the IBD probability between paternal and maternal haplotypes at a locus was 0.0. The heterozygosity at a locus in the analysed population was estimated as follows: 1) the probability that an animal was heterozygous at a locus  was equal to the probability that the paternal and maternal alleles were non-IBD 2) the heterozygosity per locus was calculated as the average probability (across animals) that an animal was heterozygous at this locus. The presence of a QTL at a putative QTL locus  was sampled from a Bernoulli distribution:   where P( | ) is the probability of sampling  from N(0  )   is the variance of the direction vector at locus   and Pris the prior probability of the presence of a QTL at putative QTL locus  []. It was assumed that from prior knowledge one QTL was expected per chromosome. Therefore  prior QTL probabilities were calculated as the distance between the two markers surrounding the putative QTL position   divided by the total length of the chromosome. Initially  presence of a QTL was considered at each putative QTL position  . all QTL indicators at the start of the analysis were considered to be 1. The average posterior QTL indicator at each locus  after the burn-in  was calculated to obtain the mean posterior QTL probability at each locus. The Gibbs sampler was run for 30 000 iterations  of which the first 3000 iterations were discarded as burn-in. The Gibbs sampler is described in more detail by Meuwissen and Goddard []. Two types of haplotypes were considered: 1) the haplotypes of the first generation of genotyped animals (referred to as base haplotypes)  and 2) the haplotypes of second and later generations of genotyped animals (referred to as non-base haplotypes). Base haplotypes were formed based on a sliding window of 2  6  12 or 20 markers on the same chromosome  with the putative QTL position whenever possible between respectively the 1st and 2nd  3rd and 4th  6th and 7th  and 10th and 11th marker. When the number of markers was insufficient to the 'left' or the 'right' of a QTL position  more markers from the other side of the putative QTL position were arbitrarily added to ensure that the window contained the required number of markers. An example of a sliding window of six markers across a chromosome with 17 markers is given in Figure . . Each animal has two haplotypes at each locus  which implies that the maximum number of constructed haplotypes is twice the number of animals (). Initially  the IBD-probabilities between all possible pairs of the base haplotypes () were calculated  using the method described by Meuwissen and Goddard []. Those base haplotypes were clustered  using a hierarchical clustering algorithm that involved the following steps: 1) identification of all pairs of base haplotypes with an IBD probability among them of >  2) clustering of all pairs of haplotypes identified in step 1  summing the mutual off-diagonal elements with other haplotypes and counting the number of haplotypes per formed cluster. Whenever one (or both) of the two haplotypes was already assigned to a cluster  the counts and sum of off-diagonal values of the clustered haplotypes were used instead of the values for the haplotype before clustering; 3) for each clustered haplotype  the summed off-diagonals were divided by the number of haplotypes in the cluster. Effectively  when  haplotypes were clustered to haplotype *  the IBD probability between for instance haplotype * and  was calculated as The considered values for  were 0.55  0.75 and 0.95 for pairs of base haplotypes. Pairs of haplotypes  of which at least one haplotype was not a base haplotype  were clustered using the same steps as for base haplotypes  but only considering a value for  of 0.95. Each simulated dataset and model analysis was replicated ten times for  of 0.75 and 0.95 and all four window sizes  while in total 52 replicates were considered for  of 0.55 and all four window sizes. More replicates were considered only for  of 0.55  to enable more precise assessment of the differences in the prediction of the QTL position for different window sizes  since the first ten replicates showed that different values for  for the base haplotypes hardly influenced the predicted QTL position. Accuracies of total breeding values were calculated as the average correlation across replicates between simulated and predicted breeding values of animals without phenotypic information. The bias of the predicted total breeding values of juvenile animals was also evaluated  by plotting the difference between simulated and predicted total breeding values for the juvenile animals minus the estimated phenotypic mean in the model  against the true breeding values corrected for the true mean. To determine the capacity of the applied methods to position QTL precisely using different window sizes and values for   we determined the frequency of situations in which posterior evidence for a QTL was found at or nearby simulated QTL positions. To achieve this  for each analysis  marker intervals with a simulated QTL that explained at least 5% or between 2 and 5% of the phenotypic variance were identified. For those marker intervals and ten surrounding intervals  the posterior probability was averaged across replicates. The 52 simulated replicates had on average 74 polymorphic QTL loci and 383 polymorphic marker loci in generations 1001  1002 and 1003  resulting in an average r value (measure for LD; []) between adjacent markers of 0.14. Average minor allele frequencies were 0.167 for the QTL and 0.176 for the markers. The effect of different degrees of haplotype clustering based on IBD and the used number of surrounding markers (windows size) in haplotypes on the average number of haplotypes in the base population and non-base haplotypes are shown in Table . Increasing window sizes and lowering  for clustering haplotypes decreased the number of base and non-base haplotypes. Increasing the numbers of base haplotypes decreased the number of additional non-base haplotypes. When the window size was increased from two to 20 markers  the reduction in the total number of haplotypes ranged from 36 to 50% depending on . The total number of haplotypes at a clustering limit of IBD < 0.55 was less than half the number of haplotypes at a clustering limit of 0.95. It should be noted that initially 4200 haplotypes were defined per locus  . 2 haplotypes * 2100 animals. Therefore  applying the standard clustering limit of 0.95 already decreased the number of haplotypes to 10% of the initial number. Accuracies of total predicted breeding values of animals with phenotypes were all in the range of 0.88 to 0.89 (results not shown). Accuracies of total predicted breeding values of juvenile animals were quite similar for different clustering limits and window sizes (Table ). However  the accuracies were about 0.02 lower at a value for  of 0.55 compared to a value of 0.95 at window sizes of 6  12 and 20. Accuracies at window sizes of 20 compared to two were 0.01 and 0.02 higher at clustering  0.75 and 0.95  respectively. In the additional 42 replicates at a  of 0.55  the differences in accuracies between different window sizes (results not shown) were similar to those in the first ten replicates. The bias of the predicted breeding values did not show apparent differences at different window sizes and values for  (results not shown). Bias of the predicted breeding value for the juvenile animals  calculated as the differences between simulated and predicted true breeding values  tended to be higher at more extreme true breeding values (Fig. ). The bias showed that predicted breeding values were generally closer to the mean than true breeding values (Fig. )  indicating that the estimated genetic variance was lower than the simulated genetic variance and breeding values were underestimated. . Estimated haplotype  polygenic  total genetic and residual variances are shown in Table . Estimated haplotype variance was hardly affected by differences in window size or . Surprisingly  the estimated polygenic variance increased with decreasing value of  and increased with increasing window size. For all the scenarios  the total genetic variance was underestimated and the estimated residual variance was close to the simulated value. In order to compare the capacity of the different scenarios to map QTL  we identified regions in which QTL were segregating that explained 5% (Fig. ) or between 2 and 5% of the phenotypic variance (Fig. ). For both groups of QTL  the scenario with a window size of 2 often resulted in a higher than average posterior probability in the marker intervals surrounding the QTL position  . the QTL was often mapped in one of the neighbouring intervals (Fig.  and ). Window sizes of 6 and 12 generally yielded the highest posterior probabilities in the marker interval where the QTL was simulated  while for the larger QTL the posterior probabilities in the surrounding intervals tended to be lower than those obtained with window sizes of 2 and 20 (Fig. ).  for the base haplotypes hardly influenced the posterior probabilities (results not shown). . On average  per replicate there were 2.88 such simulated QTL . On average  per replicate there were 3.21 such simulated QTL The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of the number of surrounding marker alleles (window size) included in base haplotypes and the effect of clustering of base haplotypes based on IBD probabilities  on the accuracy of genomic breeding value prediction and QTL mapping. Window size had a strong effect on QTL mapping  where windows of six and 12 markers gave the best results  which was in agreement with the results of Grapes . [] and to some extent with the results of Hayes . []. Hayes . [] have found that including more marker alleles in haplotypes to evaluate a QTL position  leads to a higher proportion of the QTL variance being explained. However  it should be noted that in the study of Hayes .  [] the use of smaller haplotypes means that less marker alleles were used in the evaluation because only one putative QTL position was considered. In our application  smaller haplotypes implies that alleles of a certain marker are used to evaluate fewer putative QTL positions  but alleles of all markers are still used in the analysis. Grapes . [] have reported that the predicted genomic breeding value of an animal is the same for haplotype sizes of four to ten markers  but lower for haplotypes of one marker. In comparison  at values for  of 0.75 and 0.95  we found the same accuracies for genomic breeding values at windows of six to 20 markers  and a slightly lower accuracy for windows of two markers. Overall  the achieved accuracy in this study of 0.79 to 0.81 was comparable to values reported in other studies with similar marker densities [    ]. Different window sizes and  values were only applied for the base haplotypes. Arguably  the approach of clustering base haplotypes based on the IBD-matrix is somewhat comparable to using genetic groups in a polygenic model. In both situations  individuals (haplotypes or animals) with incomplete relationships between them are clustered. IBD probabilities between non-base haplotypes are more 'complete' than those between base haplotypes  since their ancestral haplotypes are known. Analogous to the situation with genetic groups  where the need to group individuals decreases when the relationships become more complete []  the different  values were not considered for the non-base haplotypes. Nevertheless  non-base haplotypes with an IBD probability > 0.95 were clustered in all cases  to reduce the number of (strongly related) effects. Intuitively  the minimum requirement for any pair of haplotypes to be clustered is that the predicted chance that they are IBD is larger than the predicted chance that they are non-IBD. This implies that  should be at least larger than 0.50. Therefore  the lowest applied  value for clustering of haplotypes  0.55  might appear to be rather extreme. However  the results show that such an extreme  value actually give similar results as the other values  while the number of haplotype effects that need to be estimated are reduced by at least 50%. A comparable strategy proposed by Ronnegard . [] reduces the dimensions of the IBD matrix by using a submatrix of the IBD matrix selected based on the eigenvalues of the IBD matrix. This method also substantially reduces the rank of the IBD matrix  while the predicted QTL position is not affected. Estimated total haplotype variance appeared to be more or less independent of  and window size  whereas estimated polygenic variance did appear to depend on these two parameters. When considering only the polygenic variances  it is expected that differences across  and window size are due to differences of explained genetic variance by the haplotype effects. A possible explanation for not finding a relation between the estimated haplotype variances and  or window size may be that the chosen assumptions when calculating the IBD matrix  . that the base generation was 100 generations ago and that the effective population size was 100 across those generations  affected the estimated haplotype variances. To further investigate the relation between estimated haplotype variance and  and window size  we calculated per analysis the variance of the posterior total estimated breeding values (including polygenic effects) of the 2100 animals in the data  assuming no relations between animals. These estimates ranged from 0.36 to 0.38. After subtracting the estimated polygenic variance  to obtain a surrogate for the total haplotype variance  these estimates for the haplotype variance did complement the trends of the polygenic variances across windows sizes and values of . Although this alternative method relies on the violated assumption that the 2100 animals in the analysis are unrelated  these additional results indicate that the applied method to estimate total haplotype variance directly from the estimated haplotype effects needs further verification. When comparing our results based on windows of two or six markers  one could conclude that the best model for genomic breeding value prediction is not necessarily the best model for QTL mapping. For both genomic breeding value prediction and QTL mapping  the aim is to accurately predict the effect of QTL alleles. The main difference is that genomic breeding value prediction aims at predicting total breeding values with high accuracy  while QTL mapping aims at predicting the position of a QTL correctly. Consider a situation as shown in Figures  and   where one QTL is surrounded by a number of markers. For QTL mapping  the aim is to maximize the contrast in explained variance by the marker interval where the QTL is located and the other marker intervals. For genomic breeding value prediction  the aim is to maximize the amount of the QTL variance that is captured by the haplotypes of the marker intervals. This suggests that models which fit the data best  . explain most of the variance  may be the most optimal for genomic selection  while the most optimal models for QTL mapping may actually not have the best fit to the data. The multiple QTL model that we have applied can detect QTL of reasonable size  as demonstrated by Meuwissen and Goddard []. For both the application of genomic selection and multiple QTL mapping  it is important that QTL that are located close together are actually identified as two different QTL to allow for selection of animals with different combinations of QTL alleles. Since the data varied from replicate to replicate in terms of the distance between and the size of QTL  a proper investigation of the ability to separate nearby QTL was not possible based on our results. However  Uleberg and Meuwissen [] have shown that a multiple QTL model comparable to the model used in our study could distinguish two QTL located 15 cM apart. The applied model  which considers all putative QTL positions simultaneously  has proven to be useful both for predicting total breeding values based on genome-wide markers and for QTL mapping. Intermediate window size led to more precise QTL mapping while increasing window size and decreasing clustering limit strongly reduced the number of haplotypes. Thus  we conclude that different optimal window sizes should be used in QTL-mapping versus genome-wide breeding value prediction.

The model assumes that individual variation exists both in the degree of the linear change of performance (slope) beyond a particular threshold of the independent variable scale and in the magnitude of the threshold itself; these individual variations are attributed to genetic and environmental components. During implementation via a Bayesian MCMC approach  threshold levels were sampled using a Metropolis step because their fully conditional posterior distributions do not have a closed form. The model was tested by simulation following designs similar to previous studies on genetics of heat stress. Posterior means of parameters of interest  under all simulation scenarios  were close to their true values with the latter always being included in the uncertain regions  indicating an absence of bias. The proposed models provide flexible tools for studying genotype by environmental interaction as well as for fitting other longitudinal traits subject to abrupt changes in the performance at particular points on the independent variable scale. Reaction norm models have been proposed as an alternative for fitting Genotype by Environment interactions (GxE) in evolutionary biology and animal breeding []. In reaction norm models  the environment is often described by a continuous variable  and the phenotypes are partially explained by the regression of the genotypic values on the environmental values. When an environmental variable is observed on a continuous scale (.  temperature)  it is expected to have a direct one-to-one relationship between the environmental scale and values. Consequently  the reaction norm model can be fitted by regressing the genotypic values on the observed environmental scale [  ]. When the observed environmental scale is not continuous (.  herd classes)  the genotypic values can be regressed on the effect of the categorical variable defining the different environments using  for example  least squared means of the class effects [] or inferring the environmental values jointly with the remaining set of parameters in the model []. In animal breeding applications of reaction norm models  it was assumed that both the mean and the variances are either continuous  monotone functions of the environmental values [  ] or that they are such only when the environmental values exceed a certain threshold [    ]. In past studies involving thresholds  the same threshold was assumed for all animals  and it was estimated based on the quality of the fit of the average performances as a function of environmental values. The objective of this study was to present a Bayesian hierarchical model for fitting a longitudinal trait showing an abrupt linear change at some value of the independent variable. Simulations were inspired by reaction norm models  and the procedure postulates that the effect of the environmental variable is not existent until it exceeds a certain unknown value particular for each individual with data. Furthermore  the model allows for partitioning individual variability on the threshold into genetic and environmental components. A general description of hierarchical Bayesian modelling can be found in []. Here the first stage of the hierarchy describes the data generating process  or the conditional distribution of the observed phenotypes given the model parameters. The following model was assumed: = + + × max{0  - } +   where is the observation measured on animal j in contemporary group k ()  and is the temperature and humidity index [  ] associated with the i observation of animal j. Random variables   and associated with the animal j represent an intercept ()  or individual value in the absence of heat stress  slope ()  or a change in the performance per unit of change in the THI index above the individual threshold (). In this study  the heat load function [] was defined in a way that was similar to previous studies on genetics of instantaneous heat stress on daily milk production []. Finally  is a random homoskedastic error term associated with each particular observation. The data was assumed to be normally distributed as follows: The second stage of the hierarchy consisted of specifying prior distributions for all parameters in the first stage. where U indicates the uniform distribution and K is the number of levels of the contemporary group effect. The underlying variables associated with the j animal    and   were assumed to follow the multivariate normal distribution: where     and    and  are vectors including scalar parameters of individuals (  and ). Parameters of a given individual were considered to be conditionally independent and affected at their mean level by systematic (  and ) and genetic effects (  and ); the residual (co)variance matrix between underlying variables was   which is equivalent to a (co)variance matrix between permanent environmental effects on the observed measures scale. In a third hierarchical stage  prior distributions for systematic and genetic effects and the residual (co)variance matrix between underlying variables were defined. Systematic effects were considered to be uniformly distributed  and genetic effects were assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution according to the genetic infinitesimal model []: where  is the (co)variance matrix between the additive genetic effects for the underlying variables. The residual (co)variance matrix was assumed to follow a uniform distribution. In the fourth and last hierarchical stage  a prior distribution was assigned to the genetic (co)variance matrix for the underlying variables. A uniform distribution was assumed as in the case of the residual (co)variance matrix. The fully conditional posterior distributions must be obtained in order to perform a Bayesian MCMC estimation procedure using the Gibbs sampler algorithm. After defining the joint posterior distribution as the product of the conditional likelihood and all the prior distributions []  the terms involving the parameter of interest in the joint posterior distribution were retained. For the model described  all the fully conditional posterior distributions are exactly the same as those described for a hierarchical model assuming intercept and linear terms []  except those involving the individual thresholds. For all the position parameters  both in the first and second hierarchical stages  the fully conditional posterior densities were proportional to normal distributions; the fully conditional distribution for the residual variance in the first stage followed a scaled inverted chi squared distribution  and the genetic and residual (co)variance matrices in the third and second stages followed inverted Wishard distributions. For the thresholds  the fully conditional posterior distribution had the following form: which can be explicitly expressed as: The first term comes from the likelihood; J refers to the subset of records belonging to animal j. The second term comes from the prior (second hierarchical stage); note that the relationship between the animal j and the other individuals in the population are taken into account throughout the given values of the additive genetic effects. In this second factor  scalars r refer to the relevant elements of the inverse of   which is the residual (co)variance matrix in the second hierarchical stage. This fully conditional posterior distribution does not have a known closed form; thus a Metropolis step [] was used to sample from it. In the model presented  the definitions of the genetic and phenotypic variances in a given environment are slightly more difficult than in the standard reaction norm models because a non-linear function of random correlated variables is involved. Thus  a Monte Carlo approximation of the phenotypic variance was determined for a particular value of THI during the measurement day. For example  in a particular environment (THI value) this quantity was calculated in the r round of the Gibbs sampler: where n is the number of records  and   with expected value   is a vector of size n with typical elements defined as below: In this expression  and  are the sampled values for the additive genetic effects for the animal j during the r iteration;  and  are random deviates sampled from   where  is the value of the residual (co)variance matrix in the second hierarchical stage sampled;  and  are sampled values of the overall mean for the threshold level and slope. They were computed during the r iteration by applying the appropriate vectors of linear contrast to the sampled vector of systematic effects   and . Finally  in the equation of the overall phenotypic variance   is the value of the residual variance in the first hierarchical stage. We used the aggregated phenotypes (.) instead of the sampled values   and  to avoid the variation due to systematic effects in the second hierarchical stage. For the case of the additive variance  its Monte Carlo approximation can be computed by calculating this quantity in each round of the Gibbs Sampler: where N is the number of animals in the pedigree;  is the inverse of the additive relationship matrix;  is a vector of overall additive genetic effects sampled during the iteration r; and  is the expected value of the random variable . The j element of the vector  was computed in each round of the Gibbs sampler using this expression: where  and  have the same meaning as those previously described in the equation for . Note that non-zero expected values are considered in the equations for computing both phenotypic and genetic variances; the derived random variables   and   are non-linear functions of random correlated variables  thus their expected values are non-zero []. Also note that the relationships between records were not considered when computing the phenotypic variance due to complexity. Based on these computed variance components  relevant genetic parameters and other genetic quantities can be easily defined for different environments (THI values). For example  heritability or expected genetic response to a selection index could be defined for different environmental values []. Simulated data sets were used to investigate the performance of the Bayesian implementation of the model described above. Different combinations of heritabilities and correlations for the underlying variables were investigated: low (0.1)  medium (0.2) and high (0.5) heritabilities; and low (0.2  0.3) and high (0.7  0.9) correlations  in absolute value. In addition  two different data set designs were considered  approximately 20 (S20) and 10 (S10) records per animal. Thus  12 different scenarios were investigated  and for each one ten replications were run. For both data size scenarios the same genetic structure was considered but with different sizes. For S20 in the first generation  40 males and 200 females were generated  and in the second generation  each sire was mated to five females  producing four full sibs from each mating. Thus  the entire population consisted of 1 040 animals. For S10 in the first generation  80 males and 400 females were generated  and in the second generation  each sire was again mated to five females  producing four full sibs. In this case the entire population consisted of 2080 animals. This genetic structure resembles prolific species populations like swine or rabbit. For both data structures 21 500 records were generated according to the described model and assigned to the total number of animals in the population. For generating records only an overall mean (with a value of 90) was considered in the first hierarchical stage as the CG effect  and overall means for the threshold (19) and for the slope (-0.5) were the only considered systematic effects in the second hierarchical stage. THI values were generated by sampling from a Normal distribution with mean 18.0 and variance 10.0  resembling the distribution of THI values in a temperate climate. For each replication  a Gibbs Sampler algorithm was run for 100 000 rounds  of which the first 10 000 were discarded as burn-in period; afterwards one tenth of the rounds were retained. The threshold level was sampled via a Metropolis step by using a proposal density that was normally distributed and centered on the previous value of the threshold. The variance of the proposal density was constant across animals. During the burn-in period  the value of the variance of the proposal was tuned for an average acceptance rate of around 0.5 under all the scenarios. In a post-Gibbs analysis  the convergence of the chains were assessed both by visual inspection of the trace plots for the most relevant parameters and through the Geweke test []  in addition the effective sample size (ESS) was computed using the function effective Size () from the coda package in R []. Tables  and  show the results of the simulation averaged over 10 replications for the 12 investigated scenarios. For all the parameters and models  the true values were well within the uncertain regions  which is an empirical indication of the unbiasedness of the inferential method. In addition the means for all the parameters were very close to their respective true values. As expected  inference efficiency  measured through the marginal posterior standard deviation averages across parameters in Tables  and  (except residual variance)  was reduced as the correlations between underlying variables was reduced. On the contrary  algorithm efficiency  measured through the ESS averages across parameters in Tables  and  (except residual variance)  decreased as correlations increased. In both correlation scenarios  increasing heritability increases inference efficiency for genetic correlations but reduces efficiency for the estimation of heritabilities and environmental correlations. In general  the algorithm average efficiency increases with heritability but some exceptions can be found  particularly under data structure S10. Figure  shows the marginal posterior distributions and trace plots for the overall mean of the threshold level obtained in one replication in the scenarios of high correlation and low  medium and high heritabilities when the data structure was S10. The reduction in quality of the chain as heritability decreases can be observed in Tables  and . . a) high correlation and high heritability  b) high correlation and medium heritability  c) high correlation and low heritability. Patterns of heritability with change in the THI during the measure day are shown in Figure ; these plots are estimated from one replication in the scenarios of high correlations and all the cases of heritability with the S10 data structure. Relatively flat patterns were observed  and the 95%HPD region always well covering the true pattern  computed using the approximate formulas as previously described. . high correlation and high heritability  b) high correlation and medium heritability  c) high correlation and low heritability; the line represents the true pattern  points are the estimated value for the particular THI pattern and the segments represent 95% highest density regions. Table  shows averages across replications of Pearson correlations between predicted and true breeding values for the underlying variables for the 12 investigated scenarios. The predictors were assumed to be the average of the marginal posterior distributions. The observed values of these correlations  . accuracies  correspond well with the heritabilities and correlations used during the simulation. Table  shows averages across replications of Pearson correlations between true and predicted values for the underlying random variables defining the model in the first stage of hierarchy  under the 12 investigated scenarios. The model presented in this study provides greater flexibility over traditional reaction norm models when the environmental variable is known  as it allows a semi-parametric form for the reaction norm function. This is a semi-parametric model in the sense that the point in which the linear change is assumed to start is defined by the data themselves. The forms of the functions before and after this point are defined parametrically   .  constant before the change point and a linear function afterwards. To increase flexibility  higher order polynomials or spline functions could be fitted within each one of these two separate periods  with the advantage that within each one of the periods  the functions would remain linear on the parameters. The presented inferential procedure gave unbiased estimates because the uncertain regions always covered the true value of the parameters. Several alternative algorithms have been proposed for non-parametric or semi-parametric curve fitting. One of them is a Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm where the optimal number of change points (parameters in the model) is estimated []. The model presented in this study is a simplified version of this semi-parametric procedure  as the number of parameters is fixed . However  the indicated study focuses on fitting averages along the independent variable trajectory; in our case we fit individual sources of variation throughout this trajectory. For this purpose and from a computational point of view  the proposed hierarchical structure is particularly suitable  since the dimension of the problem became greater than when fitting changes in the mean. By using this hierarchical structure  updating mixed model equations in each round of the Gibbs Sampler can be avoided; only the right hand side needs to be modified. In addition  this hierarchical structure jointly with the Bayesian estimation procedure allows for a more appropriate prior assumption that takes advantage of the family structure in the population. Other general procedures for finding change points in continuous functions are the so-called change point techniques. These approaches were previously used in animal breeding to find points of change when fitting heterogeneous residual variance analysing test day milk records []. These approaches provide greater flexibility than the models presented because they allow for non-linear functions within each one of the defined regions. However these techniques are more complex because of the non-linearity and the values of two successive functions at change points need to be constrained explicitly to be identical. Our parametrization model can be considered a truncated power representation of a linear spline []  and in these cases the aforementioned constraints are implicitly considered []. Like other previously proposed reaction norm models [    ]  the described model could be used for studies and evaluations for genetic tolerance to high heat. The model allows the identification of not only those individuals in the population that are less sensitive to temperature changes after a particular threshold  but also those that became heat stressed at higher values of temperature or THI value. And this individual variation can be partitioned into environmental and genetic components  both for the threshold and the intensity of sensitivity to heat stress. This makes it possible to identify genetically superior individuals for a particular underlying variable of interest: intercept  slope  threshold  or some index involving these variables. The load function used in this study is the same used for fitting the effect of instantaneous THI on milk production []. However it is relatively straight forward to consider more complex functions  for example  those used for studying cumulative effect of THI on carcass weight in pigs [  ]. In the described model  the covariate (THI) is assumed to be known; however  a traditional reaction norm model could be fitted by predicting an unobserved environmental covariate from the contemporary groups. This extension can be implemented either in two steps as in Kolmodin . [] or more complexly as in Su . [] by integrating out all the possible values of the contemporary group effects. In these models with unknown covariates  it could be equally reasonable to assume that no effect is observed on the phenotypic performance until some threshold in the environmental scale is reached  beyond which some kind of change in the performance could be expected. The presented model was applied to study variability on the onset of heat stress tolerance on milk production in dairy cattle. In this study the population size was around 90 000 animals and over 300 000 test-day records were considered. For this data set 250 000 Gibbs iterations took approximately 5.0 CPU days. Although the methodology presented has been illustrated by focusing on the genetics of heat stress tolerance  more applications could be considered. In particular those longitudinal traits showing a threshold response  .  those traits with an abrupt change in the response beyond some point on the explanatory variable scale could be fitted using the model presented. A model for fitting traits in which the response to an environmental variable is subject to an abrupt linear change was presented. The described statistical procedure performed satisfactorily under the simulated scenarios in estimating the model parameters. As an application example  the model could be useful for identifying animals with higher adaptation to environmental changes  to heat in particular. These animals will be characterized by a smaller phenotypic decline in the performance as well as a later onset of environmental stress. In addition  the proposed methodology can attribute the individual variation on these two expressions of tolerance to environmental stress to genetic and systematic components  which would be useful for the detection of genetically superior breeding animals to be used in selection.

Optimal contributions based on pedigrees with missing parent information hampers conservation of genetic diversity; however  missing parent information can be corrected. It is crucial to know which animals are founders. We strongly recommend that pedigree registration include whether missing parents are either true founders or non-founders. Genetic diversity within populations is necessary for adaptive capacity and avoidance of inbreeding depression on the long term. A critical fact is that small populations are at risk of losing their adaptive capacity because genetic drift constantly lowers genetic diversity. An important strategy in conservation genetics is the preservation of genetic diversity by minimizing the average mean kinship  the preferential breeding of genetically important  or distantly related  animals [  ]. In theory  the most efficient method to minimize kinship is to use optimal contribution selection (OCS) [  ]  a strategy that calculates contributions so that the weighted average mean kinship among potential parents (candidates) is minimized. This strategy associates higher contributions to genetically important animals  while animals with over-represented ancestors receive lower or zero contributions. OCS has been implemented using either complete and correct information on pedigrees [] or a sufficient number of molecular markers per candidate [  ]. However  in other cases  pedigree information has been erroneous  either because of missing parent information  resulting in gaps in the pedigree  or because of wrong parent information resulting in misidentified parents. In zoo populations  missing parent information is more often the rule than the exception []  and even for many commercial domestic populations  it is well known that the recorded pedigree does not generally fully represent the true pedigree. Wrong parentage (misidentified parents) is often not detectable without molecular markers and can be due to (1) undetected mating (such as mating by multiple males in litters)  (2) misidentification of the parent  (3) interchange of young animals  (4) data entry typos  etc. Table  shows an overview of the occurrence of wrong parent information in the literature as revealed by genotyping data in livestock populations [–]. Most authors report error rates of approximately 10%. These rates are estimates and the real percentage of undetected wrong parent information might be lower or higher. For example  Bovenhuis and van Arendonk [] have reported an estimation of the rate of wrong parent information based on milk samples around 9 to 12%. These figures do not include only true pedigree errors  but could also result from animal sampling errors and from mixing up samples during analyses. For example  Ron . [] and Weller . []  in studies on the same herd found different values for wrong parent information because of differences in methodology. Little is known on the effects of erroneous pedigree information on the efficiency of conservation decisions. In this article  we analyze the effect of missing parent or wrong sire information on the amount of diversity conserved when OCS is applied as a conservation strategy using a Monte Carlo simulation. We have investigated the amount of diversity saved by comparing three different situations: (1) OCS based on observed pedigree (including wrong and/or missing pedigrees)  (2) OCS based on true pedigrees  and (3) breeding with equal contributions  a method that requires no (pedigree) information. A simulation was conducted to produce 200 replicates of diploid populations with both true and observed pedigree information. True pedigrees were converted to erroneous pedigrees using two methods: (1) changing sire records  resulting in wrong sire information (WSI) and (2) setting parent records to missing  resulting in missing parent information (MPI). To understand the impact of population parameters  a panmictic standard population and deviations were simulated. For each replicate  the true kinship based on true pedigree and the observed kinship based on observed pedigree with WSI and/or MPI were calculated in the 10 generation. Subsequently  effects of pedigree errors in the 10 generation were assessed using statistical criteria for true and observed kinship  and by comparing saved diversity based on true versus observed kinship. Instead of evaluating the effects for only one generation  an additional breeding scheme evaluated effects over multiple generations. In all schemes  the population sizes and sex ratios varied. A panmictic (random mating) population was used as the basic model. Populations were bred for 10 discrete generations from a base generation of (unrelated) founders. For each generation  10 males and 50 females were randomly selected as parents of the next generation. Females produced an average litter of 2.5  which was a Poisson-distributed litter size. Males had a Poisson-distributed number of mates (on average 5) and the average number of progeny was 12.5. For each generation  offspring were produced using random mating and both the true and observed pedigrees were recorded. Parameters derived from observed pedigree information are indicated with '' in this paper. True kinship () between individuals was calculated from the true pedigree  and observed kinship () was calculated from the observed pedigree using the tabular method []. The 10 generation had a fixed number of 100 individuals (candidate parents). For each generation  observed pedigrees were created from true pedigrees by substituting 0% to 25% of the true fathers by another father taken at random from the same generation as the true father. For each generation  observed pedigrees were created from true pedigrees  by setting  sires  or both parents to missing for 0% to 100% random individuals. The combined effect of WSI and MPI was investigated by applying 0% to 100% MPI on the standard population with 10% WSI. Kinship can be corrected for MPI. VanRaden [] have stated that unknown parents should be related to all other parents by twice the mean inbreeding level of the period. Instead of mean inbreeding level  the average mean kinship among parents was used. For each replicate  both true and observed kinships were calculated between all pairs of individuals from the 10 generation using the tabular method []. The effect of WSI and/or MPI was investigated by comparing true and observed kinships using two types of criteria: (1) statistical criteria and (2) a diversity criterion. Three statistical criteria were used for the analysis: (1) the correlation between true and observed kinships ()  which measures the proportion of the variance in true kinship explained by observed kinship; (2) the regression coefficient of observed kinship on true kinship ()  which is a measure for bias in the observed differences in kinship among pairs of individuals; and (3) the regression coefficient of true kinship on observed kinship ()  which indicates whether observed kinship is an \"unbiased\" prediction of true kinship. In practice  the latter is important since conservation decisions are based on observed kinship and not on true values []. Kinship of individuals with themselves was excluded from all three statistical criteria. Though statistical criteria are informative  they do not directly reveal the amount of conserved genetic diversity when using observed pedigrees in practice. In addition  we applied a diversity criterion    which evaluates the Diversity Saved when optimal contributions are based on observed pedigrees.  was calculated from three underlying diversity measures  which are expressed on the scale of founder genome equivalents () [].  s are the number of equally contributing founders with no random loss of founder alleles in descendants that would be expected to produce the same genetic diversity (or kinship) as the population under study [  ]. This scale is a natural number and easier to interpret than probabilities or percentages []. The three underlying diversity measures were (1)   genetic diversity conserved when equal contributions were applied; (2)   genetic diversity conserved when OCS were applied based on true kinship; and (3)   the genetic diversity conserved when OCS were applied based on observed kinship (hence the ''). The three diversity measures     and  were based on a weighted average mean kinship among candidate parents []. The diversity measures () were calculated using the following Equation: where  is a matrix of true kinships among all individuals  including kinship of individuals with themselves  and  is a column vector of proportional contributions of candidate parents to future generation (which were always 100 animals in the 10 generation)  so that sum of elements of  equals one []. By varying the contributions of individuals ()  average mean kinship among candidates  and thus the average mean kinship in the future generations  can be increased or decreased. was calculated by substituting  in Equation  with   which is a vector of equal contributions per candidate parent  so that the sum of elements of equals one. is simply the average mean kinship of the current population  expressed on the scale of FGE. was calculated by substituting  in Equation  with   which is an optimum contribution vector that minimizes   and therefore maximizes diversity. is given by: where  is a column vector of ones. When negative contributions were obtained  the most negative contribution was set to zero and vector was recalculated until all contributions were non-negative. This method does not necessarily find the true optimal solution. True optimum was always found  however  when contributions were not fixed a []. measures the diversity that could be obtained in future generations (assuming overlap) and a practical example is the selection of animals for a gene bank to reconstruct a future population.  was calculated by substituting  in Equation  with the  optimum contribution vector (). was calculated by substituting  in Equation  by the matrix of observed kinship ().  measures the obtained diversity when OCS is applied on observed pedigrees. The diversity criterion represents the fraction Diversity Saved () by applying optimal contributions based on observed pedigree; this was calculated as follows:  evaluates the Diversity Saved when optimal contributions were based on observed pedigrees;   as a fraction of the full amount of diversity that could have been saved with optimal contributions based on true pedigree data; – . Equal contributions were used as a base of comparison  as this would be the logical selection method if no information on kinship is available. Note that in practice not all the individuals can be parent  even when desired  which causes genetic drift. This could cause a setback in the genetic diversity gained for both equal contribution- as well as optimal contribution-schemes. The 'observed ' () was calculated by substituting  and  in Equation  with  and . Breeders only have observed pedigrees. Therefore  the true genetic diversity obtained due to optimal contributions () is not known to breeders. Hence   is the genetic diversity that breeders predict to obtain  based on the observed pedigrees. To analyze the effect of WSI and MPI on genetic diversity over multiple generations  OCS was applied as a breeding scheme. The first five generations were randomly bred like the standard population. The following five generations were bred using OCS based on observed pedigrees. Each sex contributed half the genes to the next generation. OCS were calculated including this constraint using Sonesson and Meuwissen []: where  is a vector of proportional contributions of () selection candidates to the next generation  so that contributions of males within  equals 1/2 and contributions of females within  equals 1/2   is a matrix of kinship based on observed pedigrees   is a column vector of ones  and  is a (2 × n) design matrix indicating sex of the selection candidates. When negative contributions were obtained  the most negative contribution was set to zero and  was recalculated until all contributions were non-negative. Next  these continuous contributions per candidate were converted into a desired number of offspring per candidate. Each generation  mating began with a randomly assigned male and female that produced progeny  until one reached its desired number of offspring. Then  another random male or female candidate was assigned to the remaining male or female in order to produce progeny until one reached its desired number of offspring. This was repeated until all selected candidates reached their desired number of offspring  and the last generation resulted in 100 individuals.   and were obtained by five generations of selection using Equation : with  selection was based on pedigrees containing errors; with selection was based on true pedigrees; and with selection was based on MPI of 100% (a scenario that comes close to equal contributions). Hence   was calculated by equation . Figure  shows diversity expressed in founder genome equivalents (FGE) of the standard population with increasing percentages of WSI in three ways: average kinship ()  optimal kinship () and   which is the true kinship from applying OCS on observed (possible erroneous) pedigrees. In the standard population  the average was 2.68 and average was 2.81  which shows that genetic diversity can be increased by applying OCS. The fluctuation of   and  among scenarios was due to random variation among replicates  and was equal for all three measures. As expected   equalled when the percentage of WSI was zero. With increasing percentage of WSI from 0% to 25%   decreased approximately linearly. . Results are averages of 200 replicates of the standard population. Standard errors of results were 0.02. Trend lines are added for each legend entry. is Founder genome equivalent of the average kinship (achieved by applying equal contributions). is Founder genome equivalent of the average kinship achieved by applying optimal contributions based on true pedigrees.  is Diversity Criterion  the founder genome equivalent of the average kinship achieved by applying optimal contributions based on observed pedigrees. Figure  shows the statistical criteria and  for the same schemes as in Figure . Figure  shows that when the percentage of WSI increase    correlation and regression ( and ) decrease approximately linearly. However   decreases faster than correlation. As shown in Figure    follows the trend line of  and decreases approximately by 0.029 with each 1% increase of WSI. Extrapolation of results for  in the standard population indicates that  on average   would be zero at a WSI of approximately 35%. In other words  from 0 to 35% WSI  when OCS is applied  diversity is on average still higher than would be the case if equal contributions were applied (). . Results are averages of 200 replicates of the standard population.

Simulations with larger population sizes or differences in sex ratio showed the same trend for      and  as the standard population (results not shown). The slope of  was less than when sex ratio was higher. For example  with a 1:1 sex ratio   decreases by about 0.022 with each 1% increase of WSI  and  would be zero at approximately 45% WSI. A real population represents a single replicate  not the average over replicates. Therefore  variance among replicates was illustrated. Figure  gives the  for all 200 replicates of the standard population with 5%  10% or 20% of WSI  arranged in order of their value. The 20 replicates with the poorest results have far lower values than average  and this phenomenon was observed in all simulated scenarios with WSI. Therefore  with an OCS over 10%  populations run the risk of losing much of their diversity  .  is fraction of diversity saved by applying optimal contributions based on observed pedigrees having WSI (wrong sire information). 200 replicates were arranged in order of  result for standard populations having 5%  10% and 20% WSI. Our results indicate a moderately negative influence of wrong parent information on genetic variation saved by means of OCS in panmictic (random-mating) populations. Our findings suggest that in a panmictic population with approximately 10 to 20% WSI  which is common in practice (Table )  OCS would  on average  save more genetic diversity than equal contributions. In some cases  however  selection of parents by OCS might decrease diversity more than the application of equal contributions. Nevertheless  equal contributions do not have that risk. Note that in real populations  dam information may also be wrong. Figure  gives      and  of standard populations with different percentages of MPI. Though both parent records were set to missing  results for 'removal' of only one parent would show a similar pattern  since this single missing parent would miss both parents in the previous generation. True and exhibit the same values as in Figure  and are not shown. While  decreases almost linearly with an increasing percentage of missing parents   immediately and strongly decreases towards 0.5 and then steadily returns to 0.7. This non-linear pattern of  is even clearer. Even with very little MPI   exhibits a strong decrease and drops below zero  which is the value of diversity that would have been maintained if equal contributions were applied. From 3% onwards   gradually increases back to zero. At 100% equals  and consequently  is zero (equation 6). Finally  Figure  shows that correlation () is between  and   due to the relationship among    and . Note that although 1% missing parents already strongly affects diversity  the statistical criteria    and  do not elucidate this clear non-linear decrease of diversity. Thus  statistical criteria do not reveal the significance of the difference between true and observed kinships. A similar trend for      and  is observed in simulations with larger population sizes and differences in sex ratio (results not shown). In conclusion  simulations reveal a strong and non-linear effect on diversity due to missing parent information (MPI). The negative effect of MPI is best illustrated by . Even when as little as 0.5% of related animals without registered parents are treated as unrelated founders  OCS decreases diversity due to high contributions given to these animals or their offspring. . Results are averages of 200 replicates of the standard population. Standard errors of results were 0.01 or less  except for  where values up to 40% had standard errors up to 0.13. is fraction of diversity saved by applying optimal contributions based on observed pedigrees instead of true pedigrees.  is the correlation between observed kinship and true kinship. is the regression coefficient of observed kinship on true kinship. is the regression coefficient of true kinship on observed kinship. To illustrate the overestimation of diversity due to MPI  Figure  shows the average FGE of true kinship ()  observed kinship () and observed optimal kinship () for the standard population with increasing MPI. When MPI is undetected  related animals with missing parents are regarded as unrelated founders. Founders are defined as animals without parents that are unrelated to other founder animals. Therefore  MPI leads to overestimation of diversity. Figure  shows that  and  increase with increasing MPI  while true diversity is much lower. . Overestimation of diversity is also shown by  (Figure ). To avoid overestimation of the conserved genetic diversity  it is important that observed kinship is an \"unbiased\" predictor of true kinship  which requires that  equals one. In the case of WSI   gradually decreases. The strong decrease of  in the case of MPI indicates that the amount of conserved genetic diversity will be overestimated when selecting the least related individuals based on observed kinship. Although  indicates overestimation (Figure )  it does not predict the strong overestimation of  in Figure . A similar trend for  was observed in simulations where only sires were missing  though  behaved slightly differently. Logically  correlation for missing sire information decreased less rapidly than with both parents missing (results not shown). Fraction diversity saved () after five generations of breeding by OCS based on observed pedigrees gradually decreased with increasing percentages of wrong sires (WSI). With WSI of 0%   is 1 by definition; with 10%   was 0.73; and with 25%   was 0.43.  decreased roughly by 0.022 with each 1% increase of WSI. Extrapolation showed that  would be zero at around 46% WSI. Figure  shows  for populations that were bred for five generations as the standard population followed by five generations OCS based on kinship calculated from pedigrees with different percentages of MPI. Once kinship was non-corrected as in Figure   and once kinship was corrected for missing pedigree information by VanRaden []. For non-corrected OCS   decreases strongly at levels as low as 0.5% MPI  and then drops below zero. From 5% missing parents onwards   increases again towards zero. For VanRaden-corrected OCS   starts at 1 and gradually drops to zero until 50% MPI. From 50% MPI and upward  on average no apparent difference is observed between equal contributions and OCS based on non- or VanRaden corrected kinship. Figure  shows again that OCS based non-corrected kinship calculated from pedigrees with MSI can only decrease diversity. Comparing Figure  with Figure   which shows results for a single generation  the decrease is not as strong as expected if all five generations were affected by MPI as strongly as a single generation. The reason for this is that the error did not accumulate each generation after it is 'incorporated' by OCS. Therefore relative loss due to pedigree errors mainly occurred in the first generation that started OCS. .  (fraction diversity saved due to application of Optimal Contribution Selection  OCS) are averages of 200 replicates obtained after five generations of random breeding followed by five generations of OCS based on  corrected or -corrected kinship  calculated from pedigrees with different percentages of wrong sire information. Standard errors of results were 0.1 or lower. This research investigated a panmictic population  assuming control over a population. In practice  species or populations differ in population structure due to aspects like unequal sex ratio and/or limited number of progeny per female  etc. Conservationists have to consider these constraints. With unequal sex-ratio for example  equal contributions cannot be applied and instead optimal management of mate selection across multiple generations yields lowest rates of increase of kinship [  ]. The results imply that using only pedigree information in conservation warrants caution. On average  the genetic diversity saved by optimal contributions is less with low percentages of WSI. If WSI is over 35%  on average  optimal contributions preserve less genetic diversity than equal contributions. The impact of WSI on genetic diversity for a single population  however  might deviate from this average (Figure ). In addition  when pedigrees are known to contain more than approximately 15% wrong parent information (misidentified fathers plus mothers) in a panmictic population  conservationist should consider alternative breeding methods  because expected gain is relatively low compared to alternatives like optimal management of mate selection across multiple generations. Populations in need of conservation  however  often deviate from a panmictic population. Furthermore  the type of error expected should also be taken into consideration. This research investigated the worst type of WSI. In practice  misidentified sires are sometimes related to the true sire  for example with natural mating occurs within herds. We also found that  decreased slower due to VanRaden-corrected MPI (Figure ) than due to WSI (Figure ). In conclusion  wrong parent information above 15% might be acceptable in practice  depending on the type of error and the population structure. Traditionally  MPI is bypassed in pedigree analysis by the assumption that animals with unknown parents are founders []  resulting in an overestimation of the available genetic diversity. Optimal contributions are extremely sensitive to differences in kinship between candidates. Small differences in pedigree can make the difference between significant or zero contribution for an individual animal. Animals with gaps in their pedigree will be considered unrelated and therefore be given high contributions. In this situation  equal contributions to each candidate parent would maintain diversity. Therefore  optimal contributions based on pedigrees with MPI can perform less well than equal contributions. Overall this indicates that low percentage of MPI should always be corrected prior to the application of OCS. Even a simple correction of MPI by randomly assigned parents would increase diversity  which would leave breeders with wrong parent information. However  to correct for gaps in pedigrees  more sophisticated solutions have been presented. Ballou and Lacy [] have proposed the calculation of kinship based only on the portion of the genome that descends from true founder animals  excluding the proportion due to animals with unknown parents. VanRaden [] corrected gaps in pedigrees by assuming that unknown parents are related to all other parents by twice the average inbreeding level of that period. VanRaden is occasionally applied to calculate kinship []. Compared to VanRaden  the Ballou and Lacy-correction creates more variance among kinship values  which has a possible negative impact on OCS. Therefore  the VanRaden was applied to correct for MPI in this research. We recommend two policies for conservation. First  measures that avoid errors in pedigree are encouraged. One obvious measure is to sample animal tissue  since DNA can be used both for parentage analysis and kinship estimation []. Second  pedigree-registration  like herd-books  should include information on the status of animals without parent records: whether they are (1) founders (wild-caught or otherwise known to be unrelated) or (2) related and descending from founders. Within kinship calculation  the latter should always be corrected  for example by using the VanRaden or a similar algorithm.

Thus  genetic selection for broiler traits has markedly altered cation regulation in muscle cells and may be associated with changes in muscle cell function and the development of pathology and meat quality problems. It is increasingly recognized that genetic selection for improved feed conversion efficiency  growth and muscle yields has resulted in alterations in ante- and post-mortem muscle status [–]. Low post-mortem muscle pH and associated pale meat and poor water holding capacity are particularly important because they affect the processing quality of meat []. These changes can be further influenced by factors such as heat  transport and handling stress [–]. Ante-mortem muscle problems have been identified by the measurement of plasma activities of intracellular enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK). Large increases of CK in the circulation indicate alterations in muscle membrane (sarcolemmal) permeability and therefore reflect muscle tissue damage [    ]. Plasma CK activities increase with age and body size in lines of broiler chickens and turkeys selected for growth rate [  ] and are consistent with histopathological evidence for muscle damage in both species [  ]. Increased intracellular calcium concentrations are a central feature of irreversible cell damage [  ]. Elevated intracellular calcium concentrations induced by calcium ionophores result in corresponding increases in plasma enzymes []. Proposed mechanisms of damage include calcium activation of phospholipase A activity and cellular proteases leading to membrane dysfunction []. Mitochondrial over-loading with calcium has also been proposed as a mechanism for muscle damage [  ]. Further studies have demonstrated that the sodium ionophore monensin increases calcium entry into cells via sodium-calcium exchangers and increased CK efflux []. Increased muscle sodium and calcium concentrations and decreased muscle potassium and magnesium concentrations have been measured in needle muscle biopsies taken from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients when compared with normal muscle []. Taken together  these experimental results suggest that disturbances in the regulation of cations other than calcium may also contribute to the aetiology of skeletal muscle damage  myopathy and ion channel dysfunction  and that the consequent disturbances in cation transport and distribution are the causative basis of many recognized disease states []. Muscle calcium  sodium  magnesium and potassium concentrations have never been reported in domestic fowl. Thus  the first objective of this study was to measure the muscle content of these cations in commercial broiler lines  which are highly selected for muscle growth and are susceptible to muscle damage  and in commercial layers and traditional breeds  which are unselected for muscle growth. The second objective of the study was to determine the extent of genetic variation for meat quality traits in chickens that are potentially associated with changes in muscle cell function. We used a multi-strain experimental design to estimate the degree of genetic variation for a trait by determining the proportion of the total variation that is associated with different breeds or lines. Taylor [  ] and Taylor and Hnizdo [] have shown that a minimum of 25 lines with four unrelated individuals is close to the optimum for a range of objectives. Multi-strain experiments are therefore very efficient (provided that a large number of genetically distinct breeds or lines are available) and are useful to estimate the extent of genetic variation for traits that are difficult or expensive to measure. Over 900 one-day old male chicks were obtained from 37 different pure lines consisting of 12 broiler (B)  12 layer (L) and 10 traditional breeds (T). The lines and breeds are listed in Table  with information on the source and mean body weight at eight weeks of age. The broiler and layer lines and traditional Brown Leghorn J line were sired by four males/line and the remaining traditional lines were the progeny of two males. The birds were randomly assigned to four large pens from three weeks of age where each pen contained at least one offspring from each sire. The birds were provided with  access to a commercial broiler starter diet from 0 to 35 days and a finisher diet from 36 to 64 days of age in six tubular feeders in each pen. The birds had unlimited access to water in suspended bell drinkers. A constant photoperiod of 16 h light and 8 h dark was maintained throughout the experiment. The experiment was conducted after ethical review and approval under relevant project and personal licences. At eight weeks of age  one offspring of every sire was randomly removed from each pen  transferred to a holding pen and subjected to an overnight fast. The total number of birds available for the experiment was 136 from 12 B  12 L and 10 T lines (Table ). On the morning of the following day  a blood sample was obtained from each bird using a pre-heparinized needle and syringe and the birds were killed by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbitone. Blood samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 × g and the plasma supernatant was frozen and stored at -20°C for later analysis. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) (EC 2.7.3.2) activity was determined using a commercially available kit (Alpha Laboratories) and total plasma Ca and Mg concentrations were measured using commercial diagnostic kits (Wako Chemicals GmbH) adapted for the use of a multi-well plate spectrophotometer (MR 5000  Dynatech laboratories  West Sussex  UK) as previously described by [  ]. Plasma Na and K concentrations were measured using a 614 Na/K auto-analyser (CIBA-Corning Diagnostics Ltd). Free plasma Ca concentrations were measured using a 634 pH/Ca auto-analyzer (CIBA-Corning Diagnostics Ltd.) Muscle samples (approximately 10 g) were removed from the left breast muscle for pH determination within 15 min of the bird's death (pH) and 24 h post-killing and chilling (pH). Samples were placed in self-sealed plastic bags  immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and held at -80°C pending analysis to prevent post-mortem glycolysis []. Semi-frozen diced muscle samples were homogenised (1:10 wt/vol) in ice-chilled buffer (4°C) containing 5 mM sodium iodoacetate and 150 mMpotassium chloride (KCl) adjusted to pH 7.0 []. The pH was determined in the muscle homogenates using a combination pH electrode (Model FC200 Hanna Instruments  Leighton Buzzard  UK). The carcasses were chilled for 24 h at 4°C and then both breast muscles () and both whole thighs (bone and muscles) were cut from the carcass and evaluated for muscle colour  lightness (  redness () and yellowness () using reflectance colorimetry (Minolta CR-300  CIELab  Minolta (UK) Limited  Milton Keynes  UK). Triplicate colour measurements were made on the ventral (anterior) aspects of both the breast () and thigh muscles (). After colour evaluation  blocks of muscle (approximately 50 g) were cut from the left pectoral muscle for shear force evaluation. Samples were placed in self-sealed plastic bags and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and held at -80°C pending analysis. The blocks of muscle were partly thawed on ice prior to cooking in plastic bags suspended in a water bath at 70°C for 35 min. From each cooked block  two sub-samples were obtained (3 × 1 × 1 cm; l × h × w) that were cut parallel to the muscle fibre axis. Peak force measurements (in triplicate) were taken along the length of each sub-sample using a materials force transducer (Model LRX  Lloyd Instruments  Hampshire  UK) fitted with a Warner-Bratzler shear blade. The muscle samples were defrosted and cut into 2 g pieces and weighed to 0.0001 g (Sartorius Analytical AC1 210P). The muscle samples were placed in small polystyrene cartons and frozen at -20°C before being freeze-dried at -50°C (Super Modulyo  Edwards) to a constant weight (2–3 days). Freeze drying of samples is the recommended methodology for tissue cation determination as compared to \"wet\" methods  which exhibit lower accuracy and greater variability []. The freeze-dried samples were re-weighed for calculation of the tissue water content. The samples were transferred into pre-weighed 50 mL Pyrex beakers  placed in a cold muffle furnace and heated to 550 ± 5°C for 16 h (overnight). After this time  the beakers and their contents were removed from the furnace  placed in a desiccator and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The beakers and contents were weighed to determine the ashed sample weight. Cations were extracted from the ashed samples with 10 mL of 6 N HCl. HCl was evaporated to dryness on a hot plate and then the residue was dissolved further in 10 mL of 6 N HCl. This solution was filtered through ashless filter paper (Whatman No. 1) into 100 mL volumetric flasks. The beaker was washed with no less than 50 mL of deionised water to ensure maximum cation extraction. The volume in the flask was made up to 100 mL with deionised water to provide the stock solution for the determination of magnesium  calcium  sodium and potassium. The stock solution was further diluted with deionised water  1:50 and 1:150 respectively for sodium  magnesium and potassium. The stock solution for calcium determination was diluted 1:1 with LaCl (25 ). Dilutions were carried out in 30 mL sterile sample tubes and stored in the freezer (-20°C) until all the batches were available for cation determination by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. All samples were analysed in an air-acetylene flame using appropriate wavelength  slit length and lamp currents. Each determination was obtained in duplicate and the mean of the two second readings for each sample was taken for analysis. The experiment was a randomised block design. Residuals were evaluated for normality and all analyses were conducted using the Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedure of GENSTAT . Parameters of the statistical model were estimated by the marginal method of Breslow []. Variance components from a model with random effects for line  pen and residual were obtained. Between-breed genetic variation was defined as the intraclass correlation  = s/(s + s) where s is the between and s the residual (within line) component of variation. The analysis for each trait was repeated with a fixed effect for category (B  T and L) included in the model (). Fixed effects were tested for significance by the method of Welham and Thompson []. Interactions between the fixed effects of category and tissue (. breast  thigh muscle) or at different times (. pHi and pHu) were evaluated by comparing the deviance difference from omitting the interaction divided by the degrees of freedom against a <U+03C7> distribution. The GENSTAT output provides an estimate of the standard error of s and the statistical significance of the intraclass correlation was assessed as the ratio of the variance component to its standard error evaluated against a -distribution. An approximate  average standard error of 0.1 was estimated from the formula for the variance of the intraclass correlation with breeds considered as a random effect from Taylor [[]  equation 4.4]. The magnitude of the intraclass correlations usefully standardizes the results for different traits but we have presented the importance of these results in terms of the significance of the between-breed variance component because this reflects more accurately the significance of genetic differences on trait variation. Between-category comparisons of broiler  layer and traditional lines are reported to dissect these variances into the relative contribution of genetic selection for broiler and egg traits on muscle quality. There was no detectable between-breed genetic variation in the gross composition of breast muscle. Breast muscle from B lines contained a similar amount of water as L and T lines but more organic ( < 0.05) and less inorganic ( < 0.001) matter (Table ). Intraclass correlations for the concentrations of Na  K  Mg and Ca in muscle ash and muscle dry matter were generally not statistically significant based on a test of the significance of the between-breed component of variance (Table ). The concentrations of these elements expressed as a proportion of inorganic matter (ash) were all greater in B lines compared with L and T lines ( < 0.01) whereas only Na was higher ( < 0.001) when the results were expressed as a proportion of dry matter. Intra-class correlations for plasma ion concentrations were high for Na and Ca and were of marginal significance for K  Mg  free Ca and the ratio of free:total Ca (Table ). The magnitude of the intraclass correlations for Na  K and Mg were low when determined within categories  which contrasted with those for Ca that were similar. Plasma from B lines contained more Na  K  total Ca ( < 0.001) and free Ca( < 0.05) whereas the ratio of free:total Ca was lower in B than L or T lines ( < 0.01). Plasma Mg was similar in B and L lines and lower in T lines ( < 0.001). Mean body weights at eight weeks for traditional  layer and broiler genotypes ranged respectively from 0.63 to 1.56  0.81 to 1.25 and 2.71 to 4.46 (Table ). The intra-class correlations for body weight and CK were very high and were substantially lower when calculated within categories (Table ). The mean body weight of B lines was more than three times greater ( < 0.001) than that of T and L lines  which were similar. CK activity was approximately four times greater in B than in L and T lines ( < 0.001). The intra-class correlations for muscle pH immediately after killing (pHi) were similar overall and within categories and slightly lower in B lines compared with L and T lines ( < 0001). The intraclass correlations for muscle pH 24 h post-killing (pHu) and <U+0394>pH were higher than pHi whereas only pHu was greater when calculated within categories (Table ). A significant interaction ( < 0.001) occurred between categories and initial and ultimate pH caused by a larger decline in B than L and T lines. Initial and final pH were lower ( < 0.01) in B compared with L and T lines (sed within time = 0.023)  which were similar. The intraclass correlation for muscle toughness (Warner-Bratzler shear) was moderately high (0.58) and was decreased by one-third when calculated within categories (Table ). The means for breast muscle from L and T lines were similar and indicated greater toughness than that from B lines ( < 0.001). Intra-class correlations for muscle colour traits (Table ) were similar overall and within categories for lightness (). Values of the intraclass correlation for redness () were low and not significant for thigh muscle whereas those for breast muscle were high overall and low within categories. These results are consistent with a significantly lower  value for breast but not thigh muscle in B lines compared with T and L lines. The results for yellowness () in both muscles were similar and showed a large reduction in the intraclass correlation within categories compared with the overall value and significantly lower mean values in B lines compared with T and L lines ( < 0001). Significant interactions ( < 0.01) occurred between category and breast or thigh for    and .  was lower in thigh than in breast and the difference was much larger in B lines (sed between breast and thigh within category = 0.484). Redness values () were similar in breast and thigh muscle for  and lower in breast compared with thigh muscle in T ( < 0.001; sed = 0.346);  in breast muscle was lower in B lines compared with L and T lines and was similar in all three categories in thigh muscle (sed within site = 0.446). In thigh muscle   was lower in B lines compared with L and T lines  which were similar (sed within site = 0.349). However  in breast muscle   was lower in B than L lines and the T lines were intermediate (sed within category = 0.244). Between-breed correlations are presented in Additional file . Correlations based on all 34 genetic lines are below and correlations for the combined L and T lines only are above the diagonal. The most noticeable feature of the results is the presence of strong correlations between many traits and body weight and CK in the full data set that are weak and non-significant in the traditional and layer lines. There are also several strong correlations between thigh and breast colour  pHi  pHu  <U+0394>pH and shear force that are not present among L and T lines. These data suggest that there is no relationship between pH and toughness in the lines that have not been selected for broiler traits compared with moderately strong positive correlations between pHi or pHu and toughness and a negative correlation with <U+0394>pH in the full data set. There were weak  non-significant correlations between shear force and plasma ion concentrations in L and T lines whereas the relationships were negative and significant for Na  total and free Ca. High plasma ion concentrations were negatively and positively related respectively to breast muscle inorganic and organic matter concentrations in the full data set and were very weak and non-significant in the T and L lines. High plasma ion concentrations were positively related to element concentration in breast muscle ash (0.46 to 0.75) in the full data set but correlations were negative (-0.23 to -0.47) in the T and L lines. Correlations for total Ca were similarly positive in the full data set (0.41 to 0.73) and were weak and not significant in the T and L lines (-0.16 to 0.14). Furthermore  positive correlations were found between Na and K  Mg and Ca in breast ash and DM (0.41 to 0.50) but not in the T and L lines (-0.19 to 0.13). Previous studies in our laboratories have demonstrated that genetic selection for increased muscle mass in poultry is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneously occurring skeletal muscle abnormalities (idiopathic myopathy). The condition is characterised by degenerative histological changes such as hyaline (hypercontracted) fibres  fatty infiltration  fragmentation of the sarcoplasm  mononucleocyte infiltration and focal necrosis [  ]. In addition  intensively selected poultry lines exhibit increases in plasma activity of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CK)  which is released into the circulation as a consequence of muscle damage []. Previous investigations of the effect of genetic selection on idiopathic myopathy in poultry concern a small number of studies comparing small numbers of genetically divergent lines [    ]. The prevalence and the extent of genetic variation for these genetic pathologies and their generality have not been determined. Differences in muscle composition between the B lines and the L and T lines complicate the analysis of muscle cation contents. Historically  tissue cation contents have been expressed as a concentration per gram dry weight. However  our results show that the relative inorganic contents of tissues from the B lines were significantly lower than in the L and T lines. As a consequence  results expressed as an amount per unit of dry weight will differ from those expressed as a proportion of ash weight. It is clear from the results of this experiment that B lines appear to exhibit consistently higher plasma cation concentrations than L and T lines and muscle cation concentrations are also higher in the B lines. The caveat is that this result is markedly affected by the unit weight calculation employed because B lines had significantly greater muscle organic than inorganic content. It could be argued that as broilers have a greater plasma sodium concentration than other categories  then the extra-cellular fluid (ECF) contribution to tissue sodium content [] may account for the differences in this parameter between the broiler and layer or traditional genotypes. The contribution of plasma and interstitial fluid compartments to total tissue sodium content was estimated from the relative volumes of these tissue spaces for skeletal muscle taken from the literature [–] and multiplied by the plasma concentrations of sodium for each category (plasma and interstitial sodium concentrations being very similar). Based on the knowledge of total tissue water content and the calculated sodium concentrations in the extra-cellular compartments  it was possible to estimate the effect of sodium content in these tissue spaces on that in the intracellular compartment. The differences in the ECF contribution between the broiler genotypes and the other two categories were estimated as 3.6% and the corresponding difference for tissue sodium content was 21.0%. Therefore  it was concluded that the observed higher sodium concentration in tissue from broiler type birds was attributable to genuine differences in the relative intracellular sodium content. These results suggest that differences in cation regulation exist between B lines and other chicken lines. The higher concentration of Na in broiler muscle compared with that in unselected lines is potentially important as alterations in muscle cation homeostasis may underlie the initiation of muscle degeneration [] and subsequent reductions in meat quality. Furthermore in man  raised skeletal muscle sodium content is associated with injury and disease states []. The results in Table  show that there is significant genetic variation for commercially important muscle and meat quality traits and that genetic selection could be used to improve muscle pH and meat toughness (Table ). This is consistent with recent estimates of genetic parameters and detection of quantitative trait loci for meat quality traits in a number of genetic lines [–]. Low muscle pH and higher pH decline post-slaughter are associated with decreased water holding capacity and increased keeping quality (resistance to microbial development). It is interesting that muscles from broilers were more tender than from layer lines and traditional breeds  a result that was confirmed by taste panel assessments (unpublished results). Category comparisons show that breast muscle from broilers is lighter in colour and less red and yellow in its composition than tissue from L and T lines as expected but the intraclass correlations are moderate in size even within categories. Variation in the colour of breast muscle filets is commercially important and significant differences among lines of broilers suggest that genetic selection could be effective in decreasing this variability. The greater yellow colour in the breast muscle in L and T lines may be a result of greater fatness in these groups compared with B lines or there may be differences in the colour of fat due to genetic differences in carotene deposition []. Some caution is warranted in interpreting the between-breed genetic and phenotypic correlations in Additional file  as the data set is not large . it consists of 34 and 22 data points respectively for the full and reduced data sets and there are nearly 400 correlations for each. Furthermore  the range of body weights in B lines was high compared with that in T and L lines (Table ). However  there are over 200 nominally significant between-breed genetic correlations but less than 50 phenotypic correlations compared with an expected error of 20 at  < 0.05. Nevertheless  taking a cautious approach  the data suggest that the quality of the breast muscle of heavy broiler genotypes has been changed in relation to unselected birds and is consistent with conclusions based on comparisons of two to four stocks that the cell membranes of muscle tissues in broiler lines are functionally different compared with those in unselected lines []. Correlations for muscle Na content and plasma CK activity are consistent with the  studies on muscle damage in chicken muscle by Sandercock and Mitchell []. The results are useful for developing hypotheses that carry more weight because of the multi-strain experimental design than single line comparisons. The data suggest that raised Na and Ca in muscle of broilers  even after allowing for the high plasma concentrations  may underlie the link between ante-mortem muscle pH (glycolysis)  rate of pH decline after death and muscle proteolysis  fibre fragmentation and reduced water holding capacity. These changes are probably the result of the high metabolic demand and mass of breast muscle tissue and contribute to muscle damage and changes in meat quality [  ]. These results also suggest molecular mechanisms that may provide opportunities in studies aimed at improving muscle quality by genetic means. Genetic selection for broiler traits has markedly altered inter-compartmental cation regulation in muscle cells of current meat type birds  which reflects adaptive responses to high tissue metabolic demands. Altered intracellular cation distributions may contribute to changes in muscle cell function in rapidly growing meat birds and in turn mediate the development of muscle pathologies and meat quality problems. The imposition of stress upon broiler birds further exacerbates these problems and underlies additional product quality decrements and the development of muscle pathologies. Changes in calcium and other intracellular cation homeostasis may therefore represent the mechanisms of both growth and stress induced alterations in muscle and meat quality attributes in chickens. In contrast to genetic selection for meat characteristics  selection for high rates of egg laying has not affected muscle function at eight weeks of age compared with traditional breeds of chickens.

This can result in effective contributions of breeding animals departing substantially from contributions optimised for saving future genetic variability. In this work  we propose a mating method that considers not only inbreeding but also the detailed EBV of progeny or the EBV of sires in reference to acceptance thresholds. Penalties were defined for inbreeding and for inadequate EBV profiles. Relative reductions of penalties yielded by any mating design were expressed on a scale ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 represented the average performance of random matings and a value of 1 represented the maximal reduction allowed by a specialized  single-penalty  mating design. The core of the method was an adaptative simulated annealing  where the maximized function was the average of both ratios  under the constraints that both relative penalty reductions should be equal and that the within-herd concentration criterion should be equal to a predefined reasonable value. The method was tested on two French dairy cattle populations originating from the same AI organization. The optimised mating design allowed substantial reductions of penalty: 70% and 64% for the Holstein and the Normandy populations  respectively. Thus  this mating method decreased inbreeding and met various demands from breeders. Over time  management of genetic variability and avoidance of inbreeding have become major issues in dairy cattle selection. Currently  yearly inbreeding rates in French dairy cattle breeds range between 0.09–0.22% [] and consequently  it can be assumed that in the next two to three decades inbreeding coefficients will become very substantial and very likely  harmful to the fitness of these populations. Extensive quantitative genetic studies have been carried out on how to manage genetic variability and contain inbreeding while selecting for economically important traits. In most cases  it has been proposed to constrain inbreeding rates to desired values (typically 1% per generation) and then to maximize genetic gain through optimised contributions of breeding animals [  ]. Given that genetic gain has been modelled for one trait  this theory is relevant to selection on a single trait or on a fixed linear combination of traits  an overall selection objective. However  as reported worldwide  selection strategies in dairy cattle have chosen breeding animals not only with high overall Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) but also without major faults for the detailed traits. In the past  breeders have worked mainly on production traits  milk content traits and type traits. However  today  functional traits are more and more taken into consideration  especially mastitis traits (cell counts and cases of clinical mastitis)  fertility and longevity traits because of unfavourable consequences of selection during the last decades []. In this context  breeding animals with rare profiles have become popular and used extensively  which has definitely contributed to inflate inbreeding rates. In addition  it is anticipated that breeders may exclude some breeding animals on account of faults although these animals should be saved for genetic conservation. To avoid this situation  an optimised mating plan can be proposed where mating some sires to females with excellent corresponding traits would minimize these sire's faults. Mate selection [–] has been used to optimise the expected value of progeny  mixing the different issues of selection and mating design. Sonesson and Meuwissen [] have proposed an optimised mating plan considering only known sire contributions (maximizing the expected genetic gain under the constraint of a desired inbreeding rate) but not detailed EBV (single-trait context). The objective of the present paper was to examine the potential of a two-step approach in a multi-trait context in order to contain inbreeding development while producing a progeny with a profile likely to be accepted. First  we describe the analytical method in detail and second  we present the results of a test on two French dairy cattle populations for which requests of breeders for individual cows were often known from routine surveys. A two-step approach was used. Contributions of sires and then those of matings were optimised through the same stochastic method   an adaptative simulated annealing (ASA) that maximizes a leading function penalized for constraints (see Appendices 1 and 2). In the first step  alternative solutions for the ASA process were obtained by exchanging the fate of a randomly chosen pair of used-unused available semen doses (see Appendix 3). In the second step  sires attributed to a pair of randomly chosen dams were permuted []. The problem is similar to that addressed analytically by []  except that in our case  constraints on available semen doses had to be accounted for. Given a desired average overall EBV    for selected sires  contributions were calculated so as to minimize the average coancestry coefficient  in the existing female population and augmented by that of the future females resulting from the proposed matings. Thus  the leading function was  and the penalizing function was  for configuration  of sire contributions. The details of the ASA for finding the optimal contributions given the constraints on doses and on the average overall EBV of selected sires are shown in Appendix 3. When optimising matings  the leading function and constraints accounted for several penalty components. The first component  ()  is simply the average inbreeding coefficient of matings for the current configuration being tested  denoted . The second component  ()  is the average penalty of current matings for traits. The T-penalty for an individual mating considers the EBV for some traits  in comparison with desirable values where the desirability function might be cow-dependent. Basically  two major cases should be considered. In case 1  the owner of the cow does not express specific requests for this cow and in case 2  he explicitly requests that the sire chosen for this cow has a high EBV for some traits elected within a very wide list (production  type and functional traits  and even an overall objective). To address case 1  the breeding organization chose a list of traits for which thresholds were defined and the value of a mating was assessed by the number of faults D  .  the number of traits for which the expected EBV of progeny was below these thresholds. In other words  the breeding organization made the assumption that breeders would exclude matings with EBV too unfavourable for progeny. To define the T-penalty  the obvious heterogeneity of requests (between cases and within case 2) must be circumvented by using a homogeneous penalty system  otherwise  during the ASA process  more attention will be paid to matings involving cows with more variable T-penalties  inducing an involuntary preferential treatment of these cows. Thus  the penalty system was standardized for variances. For case 1  the T-penalty for mating  (cow  mated to sire ) is defined by  where the minimum and the standard deviation were obtained by considering the whole mating set (number of matings = number of sires * number of females). For case 2  we considered the cow-dependent request function B (B for breeder) of the sire's EBV for traits  defined by its owner  based on a single trait or a linear combination of traits. After standardization  the penalty is defined by  where the maximum and the standard deviation were obtained by considering the whole set of sires ( = 1 to the number of sires). Thus  the T-penalties were adjusted so that the best mating considered was not penalized at all. Consequently  these penalties were standardized for variances only and not for expectations that depended on the cows. However  it can be easily shown that differences of expectations have strictly no effect on the SA process. The last component of the penalty function was ()  the within-herd concentration of recommended sires  because recommending too few sires in the same herd might motivate breeders to partly use other sires. Let  be the herd index   the sire index  the number of cows in herd   the number of cows to be served by sire  in herd  . The concentration penalty used during the optimisation procedure is . Minimizing this criterion would minimize the within-herd variance of the numbers of sire recommendations (including 0's)  because for each herd  the sum of recommendations is equal to the number of cows. C was constrained to be equal to a desired value   according to the tolerance of breeders. Of course  breeders might be more or less tolerant according to country  area  breed and so on. In the test example  practitioners required that for very large herds  the fraction of cows to be inseminated by the same bull did not exceed 10%. This breeder-defined criterion of concentration should be adjusted according to herd size  especially when considering small herds  where this criterion would be automatically in excess even when each cow was mated to different bulls. Thus  the maximal number of cows mated to the same bull in the same herd was defined by = (0.1)  the closest integer larger than or equal to 0.1  i.e.  1 for sizes 1–10  2 for sizes 11–20  ...  10 for sizes 91–100 and so on. Finally  the analytical C-penalty was translated into a simple field concentration indicator  the fraction of cows located in herds where one or several sires were recommended too frequently. Choosing this fraction also depended on the tolerance of breeders. In the test examples  practitioners considered that this fraction should not exceed 0.10. The SA procedure for reducing C-penalty alone was run until the field indicator  calculated at the end of each temperature step  met this requirement. Then  the desired value  was the last  obtained. Let us define the efficiency ratios  lying between 0 and 1   and  where configuration 0 corresponds to the expectation of configurations under random matings and where the minima are obtained after specific minimizations for  and  separately. These ratios correspond to the relative penalty reductions yielded by the optimised mating design after starting from random matings. Obviously  the goal of the optimisation was to increase these ratios. In addition  the full balance between these increases was requested because usually breeders have demands on many aspects at the same time. Then  the leading function is  subject to the constraint function (() - ()) and also to the constraint function (() - )  as stated earlier. The values obtained for  were observed every tenth temperature and ASA was stopped when both relative increases (compared with the averages obtained during the ten previous temperatures) were lower than 0.05%. Some matings were forbidden for reasons not addressed in the penalty function    expected calving difficulties given the corresponding EBV of the sire and the heifer status of the females or a substantial risk for transmitting a genetic defect. Matings with high penalties for F or T were also forbidden  because likely to be strongly rejected by breeders. Using dummy deterring penalty values for these matings might disturb the adaptative simulated annealing. Thus  the following two-step procedure was implemented. First  a SA decreasing the number of forbidden matings retained in the current solution was run to obtain a completely allowed mating design (about 30 runs of N permutations). Second  starting from this mating design  the ASA was implemented on allowed permutations. Finally  the full method led to five optimisations (four SA and one ASA). The first one provided an initial mating plan free from forbidden matings. The second and the third ones provided the minimal penalties  or   respectively. The fourth one provided the value of the concentration penalty to be considered as a constraint. The fifth one was the adaptative simulated annealing  constrained according to the results of previous procedures. Data originated from the AI cooperative of L'Aigle (Normandy  France) and included 151179 heifers and cows (89483 Holstein and 60696 Normandy) likely to be inseminated by selected AI sires (excluding young sires) between August 1  2007 and July 30  2008. Mating recommendations obtained from these data were sent to breeders in July 2007 (more recent data  not exploited in the present paper  were used for recommendations sent in July 2008). Animals were located in 2094 herds (average size 72  standard deviation 32). About half of the herds (1114) exploited both breeds  a situation frequently met in the area of the Cooperative. After splitting the data according to breeds  the numbers of herds considered were 1725 and 1483 for the Holstein and the Normandy breeds  respectively. The number of candidates for service was 24 in Holstein and 28 in Normandy. The available semen corresponded to 117% and 129% of the needs (1.8 and 1.6 dose per gestation in Holstein and Normandy). The major requirement for calculating the numbers of females served by the selected candidates was that their weighted average overall EBV (ISU) (2007 evaluation rolling basis) should be the same as the average observed on the inseminations carried out in 2006–2007 (2006 evaluation rolling basis)    147 for the Holstein breed and 130 for the Normandy breed. Then  selection pressure after progeny-testing was maintained constant over the period 2006–2008. As a result  24 Holstein sires and 26 Normandy sires were retained. The Cooperative has been proposing mating plans to its breeders for many years  with the possibility to indicate the desired EBV profiles for the sires to be mated to their individual cows. The answers obtained at the beginning of the year 2007 for the females previously mentioned were included in the data set analysed. The breeders were allowed to choose up to three traits according to the cow  from a list of 33 (Holstein) or 30 (Normandy) traits and to give their priority in case of multiple requests. The majority of the traits proposed were type traits (21 and 19  respectively) followed by functional traits (seven and six) and production traits (five and five). Details are indicated in Appendix 4. In order to calculate the number of faults  simplified EBV of the progeny (0.5 sire EBV +0.25 maternal grand-sire EBV) were considered for 12 traits in both breeds in reference to thresholds also indicated in Appendix 4 (six for type  three for functionality  three for production in the Holstein breed  and seven for type  three for functionality and two for production in the Normandy breed). The breeder function mentioned previously was a linear function of standardized sire EBV (after dividing by the corresponding genetic standard deviation). When requesting two traits  weights of traits 1 and 2 were 1 and 0.67 respectively  and when requesting three traits  the coefficients were 1  0.6 and 0.4. Herds could be split into herd group 1 (non-returning requests) and herd group 2 (returning requests). The proportions of herds 2 were 32% and 47% in Holstein and Normandy  respectively    corresponding to strong minorities. The average size of Holstein herds 2 was substantially smaller than that of herds 1 (43.4  57.7)  a phenomenon not observed in the Normandy breed (42.1  39.9). The lists of proposed traits were used extensively because each trait was mentioned at least once. This resulted in an extremely heterogeneous demand: as many as 3656 and 3485 distinct profiles were mentioned  in Holstein and Normandy  respectively. Fifty percent of the cows were concentrated on 75 and 87 profiles according to the breed whereas 10% of the cows were dispersed over 2225 and 2107 profiles. Analysing the demand in the Holstein breed  after weighting for the number of involved cows  requests for one  two and three traits were 24%  32% and 44%  respectively. The most mentioned trait was a production trait (43%)  followed by a type trait (40%) and a functional trait (17%). In the Normandy breed  requests for one  two and three traits were 20%  28% and 52%  a situation similar to that in the Holstein breed (breeders were prone to mention trait triplets). The first trait mentioned concerned type (55%) followed by production (34%) and functionality (11%). Finally  in both breeds  breeders paid much attention to type and production traits and included functionality mainly in combination with other traits. Sires with an EBV for ease of birth  lower or equal to 87 in Holstein and 86 in Normandy  were forbidden for heifers  which led to forbidding respectively 12.9% and 7.5% of all the matings. In the Holstein breed  sire carriers of the CVM (complex vertebral malformation) abnormality were forbidden for the daughters of carriers  which increased to 15.6% of the proportion of forbidden matings. Extreme inbreeding coefficients (higher than 8.5% and 8%  respectively) were also forbidden  resulting in overall forbidding rates of 17.2% and 14.2%. These rates increased to 26.4% and 21% after forbidding matings that exhibited more than four faults  even in herds 2. Final forbidding rates amounted to 37.1% and 37.5% after excluding in herds 2  the matings being more penalized than the average within-cow penalty. As a result  the forbidding rates were much stronger in herds 2 (60.1% and 56% according to the breed) than in herds 1 (26.4% and 21%). Constraints found for the concentration penalty in both breeds were about halfway between the concentration penalty obtained with random mating and the minimum penalty (= 0.5). Table  shows that specific optimisations could produce substantial responses. The average T-penalty could be reduced by about 50–60% in both breeds  in comparison to the average T-penalty of the allowed (already highly selected) matings  a fact likely to interest breeders. Relative responses on the average inbreeding coefficient were also substantial (minus 25–30%). The next step was to examine whether the optimisation method proposed could recover a significant part of this potential. Optimisation was conducted over 230 temperatures for the Holstein breed and 270 temperatures for the Normandy breed  constraining the relative reductions for the F-penalty and the T-penalty to be the same. Table  shows that this requirement was fulfilled. For these penalties  relative penalty reductions were about 70% in Holstein and 64% in Normandy. Therefore  optimisation could be considered as fairly efficient and an acceptable trade-off between the three conflicting penalties was found. Table  presents the detailed results obtained for the Holstein breed. In herds 1  optimisation made it possible to decrease the inbreeding coefficient by about 1% (25% of the value with random matings) and the numbers of faults by about 1 (30% of the value with random matings). Optimisation also reduced the standard deviations and the maxima. Only 39 herds (mostly with a size smaller than 30) out of 1069 could be considered as presenting an excessive use of some bulls. In herds 2  the initial inbreeding coefficient was higher than in herds 1 (+0.3%)  which was apparently due to longer pedigrees of dams (7.0  s. 6.4 generations) and may be the consequence of older herd involvement in recording and breeding schemes. This fact indicated that the higher average inbreeding of the optimised matings in herds 2 was not the direct consequence of breeders' requests. Optimisation was almost ineffective in herds 2 on the number of faults but succeeded in reducing by half the average T-penalty as expected. Unsurprisingly  a significant proportion of herds 2 (205/606)  mostly with a size smaller than 50  exhibited concentration problems. Hopefully  this kind of problem might be more accepted by breeders of herds 2 because they have strong requirements for bulls. Table  presents the Normandy version of Table . In herds 1  optimisation made it possible to decrease the inbreeding coefficient by about 1.4% (30% of the value with random mating) and the numbers of faults by about 0.9 (40% of the value with random matings). Only 32 herds (mostly with a size smaller than 30) out of 805 could be considered as presenting an excessive use of some bulls  a result analogous to that obtained in Holstein. In herds 2  the initial inbreeding coefficient was higher than in herds 1 (+0.4%)  exactly like in the Holstein breed  due to longer pedigrees of dams (7.8  7.1 generations) and likewise  this fact mostly explained why the average inbreeding of the optimised matings was higher in herds 2 than in herds 1. Like in Holstein  optimisation was almost ineffective for the number of faults but succeeded in reducing by half the average T-penalty. A significant proportion of herds 2 (193/678) presented concentration problems  as in Holstein. The results are shown in Table  and its comparison with Table  obviously shows that forbidding some matings  especially based on T penalties  prevented us from finding better solutions for the average inbreeding coefficients (by about 0.1% in terms of probability) and conversely  generated lower values for T-penalties (by 0.04). Thus  the forbidding system was not neutral towards penalties  it clearly favoured the reduction of T-penalties  although by a reasonable amount. Table  shows that  without any request on traits  a lower inbreeding coefficient could have been obtained as expected. Conversely  if requests had been expressed by all the breeders and had even focused on the most frequently demanded profiles  inbreeding would have been higher  but by a moderate amount. Consequently  it was concluded that the method was rather robust to multiple demands for detailed traits. The stochastic optimisation method was chosen due to its simplicity: finding alternative solutions was straightforward for the issues under study  with a number of parameters (three) smaller than when using evolutionary algorithms []. However  except for the initial temperature where a fine-tuning method was proposed  the other parameters were held constant  possibly at suboptimal values. Furthermore  stopping rules were used to avoid excessive computation time  although a few better solutions were still found. The introduction of constraints into the SA process  (which we called the ASA process) worked correctly but certainly slowed down the convergence rate. Consequently  it cannot be claimed that the approach towards the global maximum in a given computation time is better than the evolutionary approach (this would need specific studies). It can only be noted that many local maxima of the Lagrange function were avoided and that the ultimate solution was fairly accurate for practical use. This statement was supported by the fact that running the ASA process for the Holstein breed during twice as many temperatures would have only increased the efficiency of the mating design (parameter   see 2.4) by a very small amount: from 69.8% to 71.0%. The two-step approach has been also used by Berg  []  Sonesson and Meuwissen [] and Sorensen  []. In our work  the main reasons for its implementation were its simplicity and the certainty that  in the first step  the general interest could be accounted for  before paying attention to private interests in the second step. However  Kinghorn and Shepherd [] and Kinghorn  [] have been able to implement mate selection   the complex combined optimisation  using evolutionary algorithms  even in the context of multi-trait selection ( considering multiple EBV per future progeny). Here  simplicity was the primary goal  even leading us to give up the deterministic approach of []  which also optimises mate selection. For a given computation time  we did not know whether it would be more valuable to implement the single step procedure. The main simultaneous constraints in the mating method were that the relative penalty reductions should be the same for inbreeding and for trait defects. This might seem arbitrary. The only rationale behind this idea was that both average penalties should lie as low as possible  so as to decrease the risk of exclusion by breeders. We observed that penalties for traits could be reduced more easily than penalties for inbreeding. Thus  the effect of the design tested was assessed as a proportion of the maximal penalty reductions observed during specific optimisations. The proposed optimisation scheme required neither the population to be closed nor breeders' requests to be explicitly indicated on survey forms. The only assumption was that a given AI organization (or even breed association) willing to control inseminations in a cow population declared semen stores available for a list of chosen sires (candidates) and hopefully exceeding the insemination needs. Availability meant true availability of stores for home sires or potential availability after purchase from another AI (artificial insemination) organization if needed. Here  declared stores came from home sires and other French sires. For the Holstein breed  international sires could have been included but accessibility to their complete pedigrees could have been a limiting factor. Anyway  it was agreed that breeders were free to implement any mating of their own choice. The only ambition of the authors was to propose a high-quality and acceptable service that would be beneficial to the AI organization and increase genetic variability in the population. Conversely  if breeders were left to themselves  often with only very partial information on pedigrees  clearly they would have understandable difficulties in paying enough attention to this problem. In the proposed optimisation scheme  some degree of disassortative mating was introduced  which normally would lead to an additional decrease of genetic variances []. However  it is reasonable to think that this effect would be small due to its dilution over a large number of traits (herds 1) or over a large number of combinations of traits (herds 2). For the same reasons  its effect on genetic covariances between traits may be small compared with the leading effects induced by the major selection of sires on the overall EBV  already carried out when choosing the list of candidates. The tested optimisation method turned out to be efficient for managing both inbreeding and various requests of breeders about numerous traits. Here  optimisation concerned only one step of the dairy breeding schemes: the use of progeny-tested bulls on the commercial cow population. Other major steps  such as producing young bulls from bull sires and bull dams might be optimised along the same general principles. This should be tested in the future. In the forthcoming years  major changes will probably occur in dairy cattle breeding schemes  as a consequence of genomic selection. In this context  very young bulls might be evaluated with high accuracy  without progeny testing []. Very likely  breeders will maintain and even reinforce their requests for individuals not only with high overall EBV but also with well-balanced profiles. Thus  optimising mating both for inbreeding and a multi-trait selection design will still be required. The funds saved by giving up progeny-testing should probably be partly re-invested into the marker-typing of much younger candidates than that done today  leading to what we call 'the first step' (optimising contributions before optimising matings). Accounting for balanced profiles would still be needed and the corresponding optimisation would still hold. The only major change  compared with what was carried out in the present paper  would be that higher genetic gains could be targeted in order to profit from the new potential brought by genomic selection  instead of constraining yearly genetic gains to the observed past values  more ambitious values could be chosen. Research data not presented here for length reasons  have already shown that an efficient way to address the issue would be to introduce an extra penalty for the overall EBV and to try to reduce this penalty  along with reductions of penalties for genetic diversity and trait faults. The general principles of the canonical simulated annealing are described in [  ]. The term 'adaptative' first concerned the optimisation of a constant function  accelerated by managing the evolution of temperature and number of tested alternative solutions across steps []. Here  'adaptation' should be rather compared to what is called 'Darwinian adaptative simulated annealing' []. Let () be the function to be maximized  depending on configuration . This function is penalized for  positive constraint functions ()...() that should be strictly equal to 0. When optimising sire contributions  () =  and . When optimising matings    () = (() - ()) and () = (1 - ()/). For the meaning of symbols  see the main text. The corresponding Lagrange function is   where the are Lagrange multipliers. These coefficients were calculated adaptatively at the end of each step  when all the permutations pertaining to a given temperature were finished. For each permutation  accepted or not  variations of functions    ... were observed  with standard deviations    ...  . The standardized variations are /  / ...  /. For these variations  the vector of Lagrange multipliers is =  (/.../)' and the weights for *() on the standardized scales are . Let  be the vector of correlations between  and the other . Let  be the correlation matrix of size  between the penalizing . The vector  is such that the covariances between * and the penalized . have the same negative value: . Then  = ( -  ) = and . Consequently  the correlation between  and  is  and the correlations between  and the other . are all equal to  = / (*). Finally   was chosen so that the difference  -  would be maximal ('adaptation' to increase the main function and to decrease the penalizing functions) and obtaining the value of the optimal   to be used in the next step  was straightforward. This could be carried out by the Newton-Raphson method. Although we never observed that this optimisation would return an undesirable negative value for   we preferred to use a grid search and to check for desirability. The general effect of the method was that constraints were very tightly fast fulfilled and that the main function increased steadily over time. The only fine-tuning concerned the initial temperature . Let  be the variation of the function of interest after one permutation (practically  we considered the leading function without constraints). The overall distribution of  is considered to be (  ). The running rule of the simulated annealing for maximizing the function is to accept the permutations when  is positive or 0 and otherwise with a probability exp[/] where is temperature at step . Then  the initial overall acceptance rate is  where   F are respectively the probability density and the distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution. The integral is equal to . In a burn-in run   is very close to 0 and the expression of the acceptance rate becomes quite simple: .  corresponding to a desired  can be easily calculated by a Newton-Raphson procedure. It turned out that  is of the same magnitude order as . For instance   = 0.5 for  = 2/3 and  = 1.25 for  = 0.8. The initial temperature was calculated so that the acceptance rate would be equal to 0.80  a trade-off value for avoiding two major risks: either losing time with a very slow progress of solutions or a very fast progress towards a local minimum. Thus  initially  60% of 'bad' permutations were accepted. Otherwise  simple rules were used. First  the rate of temperature decrease was constant and very slow (= 0.99) in order to avoid being trapped in local maxima and second  the number of alternatives at a given temperature was constant (equal to either the number of available doses or the number of cows  according to the case). Let column vector  of size  be the vector of the numbers of cows allocated to each of the  sires  given that   the overall number of cows. Their relationship matrix is  and the column vector of their average relationships with the cow population is . It has already been shown [] that the average coancestry coefficient  in the existing female population augmented by the future females to be born from matings (resulting in ) is equal to a constant (not depending on ) + a quadratic form depending on  and proportional to function 0.5 + . Then  the leading function  for the adaptative simulated annealing is -0.5 - . Let column vector  be the vector of the overall EBV of sires. Then  the penalizing function is  where  and  is the desired value. Constraints for available doses were not introduced as additional functions because they were met by any alternative solution during the annealing process. First  the numbers of available doses were transformed into integer numbers of cows after considering the average number of doses needed per gestation. The corresponding column vector is  of sum D  the overall number of transformed doses. Vector  of size D indicates (1 or 0) which doses were used. This vector was set to 0 before starting the ASA process. Vector  of size D gives the identification of the corresponding sires. To provide an initial solution  M 1's were randomly allocated to M addresses in vector  and the corresponding vector  was calculated. To provide an alternative solution  2 integers  and  were drawn randomly in the interval [1 D] until = 1 and = 0 (or the reverse) and then  the alternative solution was obtained from swapping (= 0 and = 1)  which modified vector   after considering sire identifications and (() was decreased by 1 and () was increased by 1). Computing the variations of functions  and  induced by swapping was straightforward. Thresholds or pairs of threshold values considered for the EBV of progeny are indicated in brackets.

Data were available for bodyweight and conformation score measured at 40 days from a two-generation commercial broiler dam line. One hundred dams were nested in 46 sires with phenotypes and genotypes on 2708 offspring. Linear models were constructed to simultaneously estimate fixed  polygenic and QTL effects. Different genetic models were compared using likelihood ratio test statistics derived from the comparison of full with reduced or null models. Empirical thresholds were derived by permutation analysis. Dominant QTL were found for bodyweight on chicken chromosome 4 and for bodyweight and conformation score on chicken chromosome 5. Suggestive evidence for a maternally expressed QTL for bodyweight and conformation score was found on chromosome 1 in a region corresponding to orthologous imprinted regions in the human and mouse. Initial results suggest that variance component analysis can be applied within commercial populations for the direct detection of segregating dominant and parent of origin effects. Despite intense selection there is evidence to suggest that there is still much variation that might be exploited within commercial populations [  ]. The effectiveness of selection procedures utilising genomic information can be increased by correctly identifying the mode of inheritance of desired variants. For example  Hayes and Miller [] show that including dominance effects in mate selection can be a powerful tool for exploiting previously untapped genetic variation while Dekkers and Chakraborty [] discuss maximization of crossbred performance by incorporating information from overdominant QTL. Historically  much of the success in commercial poultry breeding and many other agricultural species has relied on utilizing heterosis and reciprocal effects [–]  yet the underlying genetic architecture is still not clear. It appears that both maternal effects and dominant or over-dominant genes play a role []. Tuiskula-Haavisto and Vilkki [] suggest that there is also recent evidence for the role of parentally imprinted mechanisms in poultry to explain the underlying mechanism for reciprocal effects. Despite increasing evidence for parent of origin effects in crosses between divergent lines of poultry  imprinting in poultry remains a contentious issue. Genomic imprinting affects many mammalian genes [] and is brought about by epigenetic instructions or imprints that are laid down in the parental germ cells []. Imprinting is most prevalent in foetal development and until recently was considered best described by the parental conflict hypothesis []. In viviparous animals this occurs where the male exerts selection pressure for offspring to maximise use of maternal resources whereas the female limits this allocation of resources to preserve herself and future offspring. As there is no apparent parental conflict  the presence of imprinting was not thought to occur in oviparous species. Furthermore  IGF2 has been shown to be imprinted and expressed from paternal allele in man rabbit  mice  pig  and sheep [  ]  but not in the chicken []. There is  however  recent evidence for imprinted genes in birds and lower vertebrates and for shared orthologues with mammalian imprinted genes [  ]. Different species may also have species specific imprinted genes []. Current theory suggests that the evolution of imprinted genes is a dynamic step-wise process with orthologues present on separate chromosomes before imprinting arose. These conserved orthologues were selected during vertebrate evolution becoming imprinted only as the need arose [  ]. Lawton .  [] show that transcriptional silencing at imprinted loci has evolved along independent trajectories in mammals and marsupials. Imprinted genes are characteristically found in a clustered organization with 80% physically linked with other imprinted genes. These clusters are conserved in mammals  marsupials and flowering plants. []. Studies reporting QTL with parent of origin effects in chicken show a similar pattern tending to cluster on a few macrochromosomes with 78% of imprinted gene orthologues residing on chicken chromosomes 1  3  and 5 [  ]. Both dominant and imprinted QTL effects have been identified in poultry for economically important production and disease resistance traits. Ikeobi .  [] found that 1/3 of QTL found for fat related traits in a broiler-layer cross showed dominance effects; Yonash .  [] found both partial and overdominance QTL effects for resistance to Marek's disease  while Kerje .  [] and Tuiskula-Haavisto .  [] report dominant effects for egg production traits. Parent of origin effects in poultry are reviewed by Tuiskula-Haavisto .  [] and have been found for bodyweight  carcass and egg production traits [–]. All of these studies have involved crosses between lines or divergent populations  reviewed by Hocking [] and Abasht . []. Detection of QTL effects  however  within model organisms or experimental populations is costly and potentially of limited relevance to populations under selection. It is of much greater benefit to directly explore QTL segregating within commercial populations. A variance component or pedigree based approach can be applied to map QTL directly within the population under selection and by simple extension of genetic models can potentially also be used to dissect the mode of inheritance at the QTL. Here we use a variance component approach to look for dominant and imprinted QTL associated with bodyweight and conformation score measured at 40 days in a two-generation commercial broiler population. Phenotypes on conformation score and bodyweight  both measured at 40 days  were available for a commercial broiler dam line from Cobb Breeding Company Ltd. Conformation score is a subjective measure of fleshiness scored from 1–5 and was treated as normally distributed. A two-generation pedigree was available with a total of 2708 offspring with phenotypes and genotypes for markers in candidate QTL regions on chicken chromosomes 1  4 and 5. Candidate regions were based on a previous three generation study of the Cobb population []. Forty-six sires were mated to 100 dams with an average of two dams per sire  59 half sibs per sire and 27 full sibs per dam. The number of progeny per sires and dam ranged from 9 to 149 and 14 to 44  respectively. Birds were genotyped for markers spaced approximately every 16  14 and 8 cM on chromosomes 1  4  and 5  respectively. Markers were selected from the consensus linkage map []. Linkage maps were estimated using CriMap [] and linkage groups corresponded to the consensus map at approximately 128–205 cM  75 – 182 cM  and 57–104 cM for chicken chromosomes 1  4 and 5 respectively. Marker distances and consensus map positions are given in additional file . Progeny were from two flocks across 17 hatch weeks. Fixed effects of sex  age of dam  and hatch within flock were fitted. Summary statistics and heritabilities can be found in Table . The correlation between the two traits was 0.34 (0.03). Further details can be found in Rowe . []. Following a two-step approach similar to that described by George . []  identical by descent (IBD) coefficients were estimated for all relationships in the pedigree to calculate the covariance matrices for the QTL effects  which were subsequently used in a linear mixed model. The   and  are the appropriate relationship matrices used to model the additive  maternal  paternal and dominant QTL effects at each position tested. They are conditional on flanking marker information and therefore unique for each position evaluated for a QTL. Here the matrices were calculated every 5 cM. It can be shown that these relationship matrices are easily estimated from the gametic IBD matrix  a 2n × 2n matrix containing the probability of identity of descent between any of the two gametes of an individual with the gametes of the remaining individuals in the pedigree []. Where  is the paternally derived allele at a locus and  is the maternally derived allele elements of the gametic IBD matrix for individuals i and j at a single locus are . From this the additive covariance between i and j is = 1/2( +  +  + ) and the covariance due to dominance i.e. the inheritance of two alleles identical by descent is =  +  []. The probability of individuals i and j sharing paternal or maternal QTL alleles IBD is simply  or  respectively. In contrast to George . [] who used a Monte-Carlo method  the gametic IBD matrix was estimated with the recursive method of Pong-Wong .  [] (software available on request from the author)  which uses the closest fully informative or phase-known flanking marker to estimate the IBD at the putative QTL. Variance components for each model were estimated using REML [] implemented in the ASReml package []. The statistical models used were: (1)  =  +  +  +  (null or polygenic) (2)  =  +  +  +  (additive QTL) (3)  =  +  +  +  +  + (additive QTL + dominant QTL) (4)  =  +  +  +  +  + (maternal QTL + paternal QTL) (5)  =  +  +  +  + (paternal QTL) (6)  =  +  +  +  + (maternal QTL) where  is a vector of phenotypic observations   is a vector of fixed effects       and  are vectors of random additive polygenic effects  additive and dominance QTL effects  maternal and paternal QTL effects  maternal effects and residuals  respectively.     and are incidence matrices relating to fixed and random genetic  direct maternal  maternally expressed  and paternally expressed QTL effects  respectively. Variances for polygenic and QTL effects are distributed as follows: var() = s  Var() =  s  Var() =  s  Var() = s  Var() = s  var() =  s. For the non-genetic maternal effect Var() =  s.  is the standard additive relationship matrix based on pedigree data only and the relationship matrices   and  for a given QTL position are calculated from the gametic  matrix as outlined by Liu . []. A test statistic for a given location was obtained by comparing the likelihood of the full versus the reduced model. Twice the difference between the log likelihood of the full versus the reduced model was used as a log likelihood ratio test (LRT). Permutation was used to set significant thresholds. For linkage group-wise test statistics  genotypes were permuted within dam families to remove associations with IBD status and phenotype. Because permutation was done within dam families  i.e. sibs swap genotypes but retain phenotypes  the  matrix and therefore the estimated polygenic variance remained the same. After each permutation  analyses for all models were repeated for every test position along the chromosome and the highest test statistic was recorded. After 1000 permutations the test statistics were ranked and the 95th percentile used for a linkage group-wise 5% type 1 error rate. Separate permutation analyses were carried out for each trait. Permutation analysis for all three chromosomes was similar so thresholds were set using the results from chromosome 4 as this is the linkage group with the most tests. In each case the highest test statistic for each model was recorded regardless of position. Empirical thresholds for each test are given in Table . For plotting purposes test statistics for each position were converted to rank by comparison to the results of the permutation analysis  and the rank subsequently divided by 10. For example  a test statistic corresponding to the 950 ranked value from the permutation analysis was plotted with a value of 95  corresponding to a 5% type 1 error. To detect dominant QTL effects  three tests were carried out: (i)   comparing the additive QTL model (2) versus the null model (1) to test significance of the QTL variance component under a purely additive model; (ii)   comparing the additive QTL + dominance QTL model (3) versus the null model (1) to test significance of QTL variance components under a model including additive and dominance effects; (iii)   comparing the additive QTL + dominance QTL model (3) vs. the additive QTL model (2) to test the significance of the dominance variance component. Tests (i) and (ii) are used in the initial search for the QTL whereas test (iii) is applied subsequently to test specifically for the dominance component. The  test was applied at all positions regardless of significance of other tests. Initially QTL can be searched for using additive ()   or single parental models ( or ). To test for imprinting four tests were carried out at each position: (i)   comparing the paternal QTL + maternal QTL model (4) vs. the null model (1) to test the significance of an additive QTL whilst allowing the maternal and paternal components to vary; (ii)   comparing the  model (4) vs. the  model (2) to test whether the additive effect was better explained by allowing different parental contributions; (iii)   comparing the paternal QTL model  (5) vs. the  model to test for contribution of a paternally inherited QTL to the QTL variance; (iv)   comparing the paternal QTL model  (6) vs. the  model to test for contribution of a maternally inherited QTL to the QTL variance. Again  all tests were carried out at all positions regardless of significance of other tests. Following Hanson .  [] under an additive model both parents contribute equally whereas for an imprinted QTL only one parent is expected to show expression. For example  for a maternally expressed QTL the expectation is that the  test is significant and the  test is not significant. For non-imprinted QTL the expectation is that both tests are significant because there is expression from both parents. Common environment effects are often  at least partially  confounded with dominance and imprinting as shown by Rowe .  [] thus common family environment or 'dam' effects were included in all models. Table  gives heritabilities for the two traits. These are low  probably due to selection of the parents []. Because heritability estimates are based on the contrast of between and within family variance and QTL variance is based mainly on within family variance low trait heritability is not expected to affect QTL detection. Figure  shows QTL effects under additive and dominant QTL models for bodyweight and conformation score. There were chromosome-wide significant dominant QTL effects for conformation score on chromosomes 4 and 5. These effects were considerable  explaining 6.2 and 4.5% of the phenotypic variance  respectively. Table  shows that the dominant QTL explains all of the QTL variance (i.e. the estimated additive effect of the QTL is zero when a model with both an additive and dominant QTL effect is fitted). . The Y-axis shows the scaled rank of the test statistic obtained when compared to 1000 permutations of genotype within dam for 18 positions on chromosome 4 for weight and conformation-score.

Dam effect was fitted. Solid line at top is 5% empirical linkage group-wise significance Figure  shows rank of test statistics when compared to permutation analysis for bodyweight on chromosomes 1  4 and 5. Figure  shows that there was not significant evidence for a purely additive QTL at the beginning of the chromosome 1. Figure   however  shows that the  model is significantly better than the  model and there is evidence for a maternally expressed QTL on chromosome 1. Table  also shows that the  test is significant whereas the  test is not indicating maternal expression. Furthermore  all of the QTL variance is explained by the maternal QTL (Table ). .

Dashed line at top is 5% empirical linkage group-wise significance Figure  shows test statistics for conformation score on chromosomes 1  4 and 5. For chromosomes 1 and 5 there is some evidence for a maternally expressed QTL affecting conformation score although the  test is only significant for chromosome 1. Chromosome 4 has two linkage peaks  however neither reaches significance. . The Y-axis shows the scaled rank of the test statistic obtained when compared to 1000 permutations of genotype within dam for 18 positions on chromosome 4 for conformation score.  and  are testing for maternally or paternally expressed QTL respectively.  +  is fitting both maternal and paternal expression and imp is testing difference between  model versus  model. Dashed line at top is 5% empirical linkage group-wise significance Dominant and parentally expressed QTL effects were distinct from one another and do not appear to be confounded therefore they are discussed separately. There is suggestive evidence for a maternally expressed QTL on chromosome 1 for both weight and conformation score associated with marker interval ADL0307-LEI0068  a region orthologous with imprinted regions in the mouse and human associated with Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome []. This region of chromosome 1  corresponding to approximately 128 to 151 cM on the consensus map  is within a marker interval associated with many fat and carcass traits in chickens [        ]. Furthermore  McElroy .  [] and Tuiskula-Haavisto .  [] both find maternally expressed QTL within the same marker bracket associated with egg production. Sharman  [] find imprinted effects for skeletal traits at 135 cM on chromosome 1. Tuiskula-Haavisto .  [] also find a paternally expressed QTL associated with age at first egg in the same marker interval as the putative paternally expressed effect seen here for conformation score. When a common environment or dam effect was omitted from the model (results not shown) evidence  in particular  for the maternally expressed QTL on chromosome 1 increased. The  and  tests also reached significance if a dam effect was not accounted for. This is possibly due to confounding of effects i.e. common environment can give spurious variance at the QTL and further highlights the importance of fitting maternal effects to avoid spurious detection of QTL. De Koning  [] found significant additive effects for bodyweight and conformation and a strong dam effect associated with this region using a three generation design from the same population. This could indicate that a strong component of the effect on chromosome 1 associated with bodyweight and conformation score comes from maternally influenced egg traits. Maternal influence on fresh egg weight and subsequent bodyweight  particularly early growth is well documented [–]. Kerje  [] report a strong correlation between egg weight and adult bodyweight (r = 0.62  0.0001) and a QTL for growth at the beginning of chromosome 1 explaining half the phenotypic variation seen in egg weight. There appear to be two separate QTL segregating for bodyweight and conformation score on chromosome 4. For bodyweight there is an additive QTL in the region of ADL0266 - LEI0076 as found by Kerje .  [] and Jacobsson .  []. There is greater evidence for this from the paternal analysis. Although the paternal QTL appears to explain most of the additive variance there is insufficient evidence for imprinting i.e. the test of the  model versus an additive model is not significant. For conformation  a dominant and potentially over-dominant QTL explaining all of the QTL variance maps to around 80–118 cM on the consensus map. Yonash .  [] find partial and overdominance for QTL affecting resistance to Marek's disease in this marker bracket. Although Ikeobi  [] find many dominant effects for carcass trait QTL  they find the QTL on chromosome 4 tends to behave additively as a single locus affecting many traits. Sharman  [] report QTL for many traits associated with skeletal traits on chromosome 4 including a dominant QTL associated with tibial marrow diameter at ADL0266-ROS0024. On chromosome 5 there appear to be dominant effects for bodyweight and conformation traits. Although the test for dominance () is significant for bodyweight the actual QTL does not reach linkage group-wise significance. Ikeobi .  [] also found modest dominance effects for growth traits in this region. For conformation score  there is evidence for most of chromosome 5 for a significant dominant QTL and maternal expression at the end of the linkage group. Abasht .  [] also find a maternal sex interaction with fat traits in this marker bracket. Chromosome 5 has been associated with many paternally expressed traits [  ] and although the linkage group does not span the region  the first marker interval is close to a conserved gene cluster of twelve imprinted gene orthologues shown to replicate asynchronously. Despite this  here we see no evidence for paternal imprinting on chromosome 5. Ikeobi .  find many QTL for traits associated with weight and carcass composition in this region although little dominance and no imprinting. Given that we are only using a two-generation pedigree we have insufficient evidence to confirm that these are truly imprinted effects  only that statistically there is evidence for uniparental expression. Heuven .  [] show that spurious imprinted effects can be detected due to differences between the number of QTL alleles or haplotypes segregating in sires and dams. This can occur for a number of reasons  for example; too few sires or dams included in the analysis  different genetic backgrounds leading to different QTL allele frequencies in sires and dams and or differing amounts of LD generated between QTL alleles and markers. To ensure information on a putative QTL is available from both parents there is a requirement for enough sires and dams to ensure segregation together with enough offspring to detect QTL. Furthermore the QTL allele frequency should be roughly equal in sires and dams. Here  these requirements are satisfied by using a large number of sires and dams. Furthermore  because the analysis took place within a broiler dam line  i.e. sires and dams have the same genetic background  neither differing allele frequencies due to parental origins or sampling issues are likely causes of spurious imprinting. Marker allele frequencies are not significantly different between sires and dams and an average of 24 sires and 25 dams are informative at any given marker (results not shown). It is possible that differences in LD between the marker and QTL alleles might occur if parents originate from different populations  however again this is not the case here and furthermore  marker spacing makes it unlikely that strong LD in one sex could have caused differences in variation as it has been shown that linkage disequilibrium in commercial poultry populations rarely exceeds 1 or 2 cM []. Using simulation  Tuiskula-Haavisto .  [] also concluded that segregation differences are an unlikely source of spurious parent-of-origin effects. A further source of error might be spurious detection of maternally expressed QTL due to common maternal environment  here common environment is fitted within the linear model. Finally  it is feasible that there are many QTL causing a complex inheritance pattern although again due to sires and dams coming from the same lines it is unlikely that different QTL would be segregating. It would be difficult to test this using the current structure due to the complexity of the analysis as it is unlikely that the extra number of variance components added could be successfully estimated. It is also unlikely that enough information could be derived from the marker spacing to estimate multiple QTL within discrete confidence intervals. Further evidence for the results found here is that imprinted effects on chromosome 1 were found in regions previously identified as parentally expressed in poultry and orthologous with genome-imprinted regions in humans and mice. Testing many models at each position raises its own multiple testing issues  one strategy might be to only carry out subsequent testing after identifying a significant additive QTL. This  however  can lead to QTL being missed due to the use of an inappropriate model. When testing for dominance the dominant QTL on chromosome 4 would not have been detected under an additive model. Similarly for parentally expressed QTL  it follows that the contrast may not be greatest at the highest test statistic for the  or  models but at the highest test statistic for the individual parental QTL i.e.  or . For example  on chromosome 5 the greatest evidence for a maternal QTL and for the  test is not at the same position as the highest test statistic for a search under the  model versus null. On chromosome 1  there is a maternal QTL and the  test is significant  however the  model is not. The  model versus null is perhaps diluted by the non expression from the imprinted parent as it is explaining the same amount of variation with an extra degree of freedom. Here we also find that a bodyweight QTL on chromosome 4 could be declared as paternally expressed based upon separate parental QTL models but there is insufficient evidence when comparing a Mendelian versus a  or imprinted model. It is difficult to know whether this is due to information source  or perhaps too stringent a threshold on the  test or too lenient on the  test. A large dominant and potentially over-dominant QTL for conformation score is segregating on chicken chromosome 4. This QTL is also detected under an additive model. However  the additive variance becomes zero in a model that also fits a dominance component. There is also evidence for dominant QTL affecting bodyweight and conformation on chromosome 5. There is suggestive evidence for a paternally imprinted or maternally expressed QTL affecting bodyweight and conformation score on chromosome 1 in a region orthologous with human and mouse imprinted regions and close to previously reported imprinted QTL affecting bodyweight and maternal traits in poultry. Initial results suggest that variance component analysis can be applied within commercial populations for the direct detection of segregating dominant and parent of origin effects.

Between-breed differences explained about ten per cent of the total genetic diversity (Fst = 0.099). Values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.43 to 0.79 depending on the breed.

Between-breed differences explained about ten per cent of the total genetic diversity (Fst = 0.099). Values of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.43 to 0.79 depending on the breed. According to genetic relationships  multivariate and structure analyses  breeds could be classified into four genetic differentiated groups: warm-blooded  draught  Nordic and pony breeds. Using complementary maximisation of diversity and aggregate diversity approaches  we conclude that particular efforts should be made to conserve five local breeds  namely the Boulonnais  Landais  Merens  Poitevin and Pottok breeds. During the twentieth century  horse breeding has undergone large changes in Europe. Previously considered as an agricultural  industrial and war tool  horse is now essentially bred for hobby riding. Draught horses  in particular  have been less and less used as utility horses  and many draught breeds have undergone a dramatic decrease in population size: according to the Haras Nationaux  out of the nine French draught breeds  six have annual births below 1000. Measures for  conservation have been applied in France for several years but such measures are in general expensive. Therefore  it would be useful to identify priorities among conservation purposes and this requires characterising diversity and genetic relations between breeds []. During the last fifteen years  microsatellite markers have frequently been used to evaluate genetic distances and to characterise local breeds  [–]. Some methods have recently been developed to evaluate the genetic contribution of populations to within-breed and between-breed diversities [  ]. With about 800 000 animals belonging to 50 different breeds (source: Haras Nationaux)  France shows a large diversity of horse populations. Among these breeds  21 have a French origin or have been bred in France for at least a century. According to the FAO  at least 15 populations have disappeared during the last 50 years  and eight indigenous breeds are still considered as endangered or endangered-maintained. Among those breeds  the majority are draught breeds  namely the Ardennais  Auxois  Boulonnais  Poitevin and Trait du Nord breeds  the other ones being the Merens warm-blooded breed and the Landais and Pottock pony breeds. Information on the genetic diversity of French endangered breeds could help breeders and providers  decide where they should place more emphasis. In the present study  we first analysed the genetic diversity of 39 horse populations reared in France: within-breed diversity  breed relationship and population structure were investigated  using microsatellite data. Then  we focussed on 19 breeds of French origin or having been raised in France for at least a century  and evaluated the conservation priorities between these populations  using different approaches to evaluate within  between and total diversity. French nomenclature divides horse breeds into three groups: warm-blooded  draught horses and ponies. In this study  39 populations were considered (Table ). These 39 populations comprised 31 recognised breeds (including 13 warm-blooded breeds  nine draught breeds  and nine pony breeds)  the primitive Przewalski horse (used as an outgroup)  and seven populations originating from the splitting of two recognised breeds  namely the Anglo-Arab (AA) and Selle Français (SF) breeds (divided into four and three groups  respectively). The 2005 studbook rules define those groups according to the proportion of foreign genes that can be found from genealogical analysis: AA6 and AA9 are considered as pure AA  whereas AA5 and AA10 can have ancestors from another origin  the proportion of Arab origin being higher for AA5 and AA6 than the others. SF8 has a large proportion of PS origin and can therefore be used to produce AA  SFA97 constitutes a group closed to direct foreign influences  whereas SFB98 individuals can have a parent from another breed (under some conditions). For each of the 39 populations  23 to 50 animals born between 1996 and 2005  were sampled amounting to 1679 animals. Except for the Przewalski horse  where no pedigree data was available  the sampled animals were known to have no common parents. For the conservation approach  the study focussed on 19 populations  either of French origin  or having been bred in France for at least 100 years (PS  AA and AR breeds). In this approach  50 animals were randomly sampled among the four and three AA and SF subpopulations  respectively  to constitute two populations. Eleven microsatellite markers were used to perform the analysis ()  with all but two ( and ) being recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics for parentage testing and used in similar studies (except ) [    ]. For the entire sample  amplifications and analyses were performed by the same laboratory  using a capillary sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer  Applied Biosystems). Allele frequencies  mean number of alleles   observed () and non-biased expected heterozygosity ()  were calculated using GENETIX []. Wright Fis  Fit and Fst coefficients were also computed using the same software. GENEPOP [] was used to evaluate pairwise genetic differentiation between breeds [] and departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  using exact tests and sequential Bonferonni correction [] on loci. Global tests on Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were also performed using GENEPOP. Allelic richness was computed using FSTAT []. The matrix of Reynolds unweighted distances [] was computed using POPULATION (Olivier Langella; ). Regarding the D distance  a NeighborNet tree was drawn using SPLITSTREE 4.8 []. A factorial correspondence analysis (without the Przewalsky horse) was also performed using GENETIX. Finally  the genetic structure of the populations was assessed using Bayesian clustering methods developed by Pritchard (STRUCTURE  []): using a model with admixture and correlated allele frequencies  we made 20 independent runs for each value of the putative number of sub-populations () between 1 and 22  with a burn-in period of 20 000 followed by 100 000 MCMC repetitions. Pairwise similarities () between runs were computed using CLUMPP []. To evaluate the conservation priorities in a set of populations  taking into account contributions to within-population and between-population genetic diversity  Ollivier and Foulley [] have proposed the following method. First  the between-breed contribution () is evaluated  based on the Weitzman [] loss  of diversity when the population  is removed from the whole set of breeds (in this study we used distance). Then  the within-breed contribution () is defined as:  = 1 - / (1) where  is the average internal heterozygosity of the whole set  and  the average internal heterozygosity of the set when  is removed. Finally  the aggregate diversity  of a population is defined as:  =  + (1 - ). (2) The cryopreservation potential () could be computed as the product between the breed contribution () and the probability of extinction () of the breed  assumed to be directly proportional to the inbreeding rate (). Following Simianer . []  can be approximated as =  = /(2) = c ( + )/8  (3) where  is the effective population size   and  are the numbers of breeding males and females  respectively  used inside the breed in 2005  and  is a constant  to be chosen. Considering that the effective population size of a breed should not be lower than 50 to avoid extinction in the short term []  we considered that = 1 for  = 50. Therefore   was set to 100 (see equation 3). Caballero and Toro [] have developed a parallel approach. The total diversity can be considered as the exact sum of the gene diversity within population and the gene diversity between populations considering the following equations: = 1 - SS/ (4) = 1 - S/ (5) = SS/ (6) where  is the number of populations  is the average coancestry between populations  and is the Nei minimum distance between populations  and . The contribution of a population to the diversity is evaluated by computing the loss or gain of diversity  when the population is removed. The authors have also proposed to evaluate the contributions () of each population  which can maximise the total diversity at the next generation  using the following equation: = 1 - S[- S]. (7) The contributions can be computed by maximising in equation (7)  with the following restrictions: for each population   = 0 and S= 1. One hundred and nine alleles were found over all populations and all markers. The average number of alleles per locus was 9.8 ranging from seven (locus  and ) to 15 (locus ). Some rare alleles in the whole data set were found with a high frequency in the PRW population: for instance  with the  loci  the two most frequent alleles in the PRW population (70%) were seldom found in other breeds (less than 1%). Heterozygosities  mean number of alleles () and allelic richness () are presented in Table .  and  were highly correlated  ( = 0.98   < 0.0001).  ranged from 0.43 in the FRI breed to 0.79 in the PFS breed  while Fis per breed ranged from -0.08 (TDN breed) to 0.11 (PRE breed). Some significant heterozygote deficits after corrections were found  for different loci and populations (see Table ). Only one test exhibited significant excess (AA5 with ). Using global tests  five populations (AB  AR  AUX  CAM  PRE) and two markers ( and ) showed significant deficit in heterozygotes ( < 0.01). Other studies have shown similar results for these two markers []. Testing population differentiation  11 pairs of populations were found non significantly differentiated out of the 741 tests performed: AA5 with AA6  AA9 with AA10  SF8 and PS  PS and SF8  AA10 with SF8 and PS  AB with BA  APPAL with QH  AUX with TDN  SFA97 with SFB98. The     and  values were 0.019  0.116 and 0.099  respectively. We found a gene differentiation coefficient [] of 0.0989. The NeighborNet network (Figure ) clearly separated draught horses (also including MER  HAF breeds) and warm-blooded horses  whereas most pony breeds were placed between these two groups. Nordic (IS  SHE  FJ) breeds formed a separate group. FRI and PRW populations were isolated from the other breeds  the closest groups being draught horses and Nordic breeds  for the FRI breed and PRW population  respectively. . In Figure   the 38 populations (PRW being excluded) were placed according to the two main axes of the correspondence analysis (accounting for 27.4% and 11.5% of the inertia  respectively). Axis 1 clearly differentiates warm-blooded horses  ponies and draught horses  whereas axis 2 separates Nordic horses (IS  SHE  FJ) from the other ones. The FRI breed seems to be isolated from the other populations  the closest populations being the draught breeds. . The projection is shown on the first two axes. Neighbornet and FCA approaches were also used on 34 and 33 breeds  respectively (the four samples of AA breed and three samples of the SF breeds being aggregated into two samples of 50 animals each)  showing similar results to previous figures (see Additional files  and ). Breed assignment to clusters provides complementary information on genetic relationships between populations. As  increases from 2 to 7  mean similarity coefficients among runs are respectively equal to 0.997  0.993  0.993  0.773  0.562  and 0.658  respectively. Likelihood increased until  reached 15–18 values (see additional file )  indicating that the most significant subdivisions were obtained for such values. Since mean similarity coefficients were slightly lower for  = 16 (0.78) or 17 (0.81) than for  = 15 (0.83)  the results are shown for this last value. Figure  shows the assignment of populations to clusters for each   using runs having the highest pair-wise similarity coefficients. . Among 20 runs  solutions having the most similar pair-wise similarity coefficients are presented here. Breeds not classified in their group according to French nomenclature are in italic. For  = 2  there was a clear separation between draught and warm-blooded horses  with other populations showing intermediate results. When  reached 3  Nordic/primitive breeds  ponies  and some warm-blooded horses segregated more or less clearly from the two other clusters. As  increases to 4 and 5  the five clusters were constituted of Nordic/primitive breeds  draught horses  ponies  warm-blooded populations close to the AR breed and warm-blooded populations close to the PS breed. Some breeds were shared among the last three clusters  such as LAND between ponies and AR groups  and APPAL among the three clusters. When  reached 6  depending on the runs  FRI or PRW populations were alternately isolated  which led to a decrease of similarity across runs and explains the low similarity coefficient (0.562) in comparison with other . When  = 7  these two populations were isolated. The different runs highlight some differences among sub-populations of AA and SF breeds  underlining a more important proportion of AR genes in AA6  AA5 and respectively SFA97 and SF98 groups. Some warm-blooded (FRI until  = 6  MER) and pony breeds (HAF) were classified with draught horses  while the CAM warm-blooded breed was clustered with ponies. As  reached 15  most breeds were shared among different clusters. The ARD  AUX and TDN breed constituted a single cluster while FJ/IS and LUS/PRE constituted two others. In a few cases  a single cluster was essentially associated to a single breed (BOUL  FRI  SHE  PRW). In the set of the 19 French breeds  we found a gene diversity within population of 0.685  a gene diversity between populations of 0.073  and a total gene diversity of 0.758. Table  shows between-breed  within-breed  and total contribution/variation of diversity according to Ollivier and Foulley [] and Caballero and Toro [] approaches. For within-breed diversity   and <U+0394>ranged from -0.48 to 0.50 and from -0.0055 to 0.0069 respectively. In both cases  the POIT breed showed a particularly low within-breed diversity.  and <U+0394>were negatively correlated ( = -0.715   = 0.001). For between-breed diversity   and <U+0394>ranged from 0.85 to 12.60 and from -0.0041 to 0.0024  respectively. Here  the POIT breed showed a particularly high contribution to the between-breed diversity. The correlation between  and <U+0394>was not significant.  and <U+0394>  accounting for total diversity  were negatively correlated ( = -0.53   < 0.019). They ranged from -0.32 to 1.25 and from -0.0042 to 0.0039  respectively. In both cases  the ARD and PS breeds showed a particularly low and high diversity  respectively. Considering contributions to the between-breed diversity and probabilities of extinction  the BOUL  LAND and POIT breeds showed the highest cryopreservation potentials (2.95  2.95 and 4.83  respectively). Contributions of each population for an optimal are given in Table : the composite PFS breed should contribute to 70% of the pool  for a total of 0.79. Besides  to maximise the total gene diversity  seven of the 19 breeds should be maintained  namely the BOUL  COBND  LAND  PFS  POT  PS and SF breeds. Differences between breeds explained 10% of the total genetic variation  which is quite similar to other analyses  where values ranged from 8% to 15% [–  ]. According to previous studies using microsatellites  expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.47 for the FRI breed [] to 0.80 for the Sicilian Indigenous breed []. In our study  only one result was found outside this range of values: 0.43 for the FRI breed  . close to the value found by Luis . []. Plante . [] recently analysed 22 Canadian and Spanish populations. Our estimated values of  were slightly lower (0.71 on average vs. 0.75   = 0.048) for the eight breeds shared between their study and the present one. Differences on the within-breed diversity among studies using microsatellites can be explained  on the one hand  by the loci used and  on the other hand  by the populations analysed  incidentally belonging to similar breeds but having different recent histories. In the AR breed  we found a  value of (0.72) with a significant deficit of heterozygotes  which can be explained by the fact that this is an international breed in which mating between close relatives is common []. Plante . [] and Luis . [] have found similar results for the same breed  but not Aberle . [] who observed a lower heterozygosity (0.57) without a heterozygote deficit. The PER population seemed to have a particularly high genetic diversity in the Plante study ( = 0.78)  in comparison with the French PER population ( = 0.68). Because PER populations have been bred in America since the end of the 19 century  such results should be interpreted bearing in mind that the French PER population has probably suffered from recent bottlenecks due to several modifications of the selection aims. The three approaches based on genetic relationships (genetic distances  FCA and clustering methods) gave similar results. The populations considered in the present study can be classified into four more or less differentiated clusters: warm-blooded  draught  Nordic and pony breeds. Similar patterns of clustering have been found in other studies [      ]. The draught horses constitute a quite homogenous group  including the nine French draught horse breeds and three breeds presently classified as pony (HAF) or warm-blooded (MER and FRI in a lesser extent) breeds. These three breeds were historically used as draught horse breeds and could therefore have been subject to crossbreeding with other draught horse populations in their past history. Pony breeds formed a group in an intermediate position in comparison to the other clusters. It also included the CAM breed  today recognised as a warm-blooded breed  but morphologically considered as a pony []. According to our analysis  FRI and PRW populations were found to be genetically isolated  which can be  to some extent  linked to a low genetic variability [] due to historical bottlenecks within these breeds [  ]. Moreover  another parameter explaining isolation of the PRW breed is the presence of rare alleles  which was in agreement with other studies [] and expected for a population considered as a primitive wild horse. Population differentiation tests and Bayesian approaches indicate clear differences between sub-populations of AA and SF. Such results may be largely explained by differences in the proportion of thoroughbred (PS) origins in the gene pool of these sub-populations. Within the AA breed  AA5 and AA6 populations appeared distinct from AA9 and AA10 populations and close to the PS breed. This was in agreement with the studbook rules: on the basis of pedigree data  AA5  AA6  AA9 and AA10 populations were indeed found to have respectively 94%  89%  44% and 59% of genes from PS origin (Sophie Danvy  personal communication). Within the SF breed  the SF8 (not differentiated from the PS breed) was distinct from SFA97 and SFB98 populations. This result was in agreement with previous results from pedigree data []: the SF8 was found to have 98% of genes from PS origin. The three draught breeds ARD  AUX and TDN  were found to be quite similar  which is linked to a common historical and geographical origin (north of France) []. Iberic breeds (LUS and PRE) were also found to be genetically quite close. These results and the fact that according to Bayesian approaches  the likelihood became stable before  reached the number of breeds  indicate that the most relevant division is situated at a level superior to that of the breeds []. Such a subdivision of the whole set can be explained by the existing crossbreeding management system in several horse populations. In the present study  an almost comprehensive sampling of French breeds was achieved. The different approaches used gave an estimation of the contribution of each breed to the whole French horse stock. Petit [] has proposed allelic richness as a good parameter to evaluate the genetic diversity of a population  useful as an indicator of past bottlenecks []. In our study  the POIT breed was found to have the lowest allelic richness and also one of the lowest within-breed contributions to diversity according to the two other methods used in the study. Because of the strong correlation with the mean number of alleles  the concept of allelic richness interest seemed to be of limited value in our study. The results given by the aggregate diversity and gene diversity approaches were slightly correlated. By definition  breeds with low contributions to aggregate and total diversities should have related breeds in the data set. Thus  ARD  TDN  and AUX breeds  which were genetically highly related  illustrate quite well such a hypothesis. According to the approaches of Ollivier and Foulley [] and Cabalero and Toro []  populations that contributed a lot to the total diversity were mostly non-endangered breeds (AR  PS  SF  TF). There were  however  some differences between the two methods when considering the eight breeds classified as endangered or endangered/maintained by the FAO (ARD  AUX  BOUL  LAND  MER  POIT  POT  TDN). Using the approach of Ollivier and Foulley []  contributions to aggregate diversity  of BOUL  MER and POIT breeds were quite high  and taking into account population size   was the highest for BOUL  LAND and POIT breeds. Using the approach of Caballero and Toro []  decreased only when LAND and POT breeds were removed  and those two breeds plus the BOUL breed should have been kept to optimise . The differences can be explained by the methods used in the two approaches  particularly considering the evaluation of the contributions to between-diversity. Using the approach of Caballero and Toro []  some Weitzman criteria  such as the twin property []  were not applied: for instance  assuming that two populations are genetically identical but very different from the whole set  removing one of them will largely decrease   which will not be the case when using the Weitzman approach. However  one advantage of the approach of Caballero and Toro [] is the fact that there is no need to give weight to within- and between-diversities to compute total diversity  since by definition is the sum of and . In fact  our results outline that both approaches should be considered as complementary to identify which breeds have to be taken into account in a context of genetic resource management. Therefore  conservation priorities should concern particularly BOUL  LAND  MER  POIT and POT breeds. Another advantage of the method of Caballero and Toro [] is the possibility of computing the contribution of each population to optimise total diversity. Such an approach was designed to conserve a large diversity of alleles. Therefore  it is not surprising to notice that the three breeds (PFS  SF  BOUL) that should have the highest contribution to optimise genetic diversity represent the three identified genetic differentiated groups. The importance of the PFS breed is due to the fact that this synthetic pony breed has the largest number of alleles. SF  another composite breed  has a smaller variability but carries alleles representative of the warm-blooded breed group  while the BOUL breed carries alleles seldom present in the two other breeds but frequent in draught horses. Finally  several considerations have to be taken into account before taking final conservation decisions []  such as the special range of performances for given traits  current production systems associated to the breed  socio-cultural value  or dynamics of the group of breeders. Between 1998 and 2003  births remained more or less stable for BOUL  LAND  POIT and POT breeds  but decreased for the MER breed []. In the endangered breeds  specific uses should be supported to maintain a demand for such horses (production of mules for the POIT breed  ecotourism for local breeds  draught activities  meat production). Genetic variability should also be managed  especially since some of these breeds constitute a pool of original genes (BOUL  MER and POIT) (see Figure ). For instance  sires with different origins should be used []. When populations of the same breed are raised in other countries (such as the POT breed in Spain [])  regular exchanges should be organised between both countries to maintain a relatively large variety of reproducers. Based on this study  horse breeds raised in France can be clustered into four groups. These groups were found to be meaningful according to the use of breeds  morphological characteristics and/or geographical origins. The combined use of different methods allowed us to identify breeds for which conservation efforts should be a priority  in order to preserve the maximum genetic variability. Since several horse studies have used similar panels of markers [    ]  it would be interesting to merge the corresponding data.

Pig breeding programs aim at improving pigs for economically important traits. Carcass quality has been successfully improved in most selection programs because phenotypes are easy to obtain on live animals via ultrasonically measurements of backfat and because these traits show a relatively high heritability. However  although breeding for meat quality has received much attention over the past two decades  it has not been the priority in most selection programs [–] because meat quality traits can only be measured on the relatives of selection candidates and late in life. Successful improvement of meat quality may be possible by combining molecular information and traditional measurements because marker data can be obtained on all animals at an early age []. Molecular information  . genes and QTL  has rapidly become available via genome scans of experimental crossbred populations (see review by Bidanel and Rothschild [] and PigQTLdb []). In many cases  favourable QTL cannot be exploited due to the poor performance of these exotic breeds with respect to commercially relevant traits. However  the number of QTL studies using commercial populations is increasing [–]. Identification of QTL using commercial lines requires a large number of families because fewer heterozygous founders are expected especially for traits under selection such as carcass quality traits. Most of the studies mentioned above use 'paternal half sib regression' as the statistical method to associate genotypes with phenotypes  which models the segregation of paternal QTL []. Variance component methods  based on the theory developed by Fernando and Grossman []  are currently becoming the method of choice in association studies because they allow for much greater flexibility in the modelling of QTL in arbitrary pedigrees while adjusting simultaneously for systematic environmental effects [  ]. A preliminary analysis using eight half-sib families  detected putative QTL on SSC2 []. Based on these results  nine additional families were genotyped and analysed to increase the marker density in regions of interest. The goal of this paper is to map QTL affecting meat and carcass quality of commercial finishers and located on SSC2 using variance component methods. The 1855 commercial finishers were a cross product of 17 boars of a synthetic sire line (Large White/Pietrain  TOPIGS  The Netherlands) and 239 unregistered hybrid sows. The piglets were born during a two-month period in 2002. Piglets were individually tagged at birth and males were castrated three to five days after farrowing. Pigs were weaned on average at 17 days of age and raised till an average weight of 22.7 kg before being moved to the finishing barns. Diets comprised commercial available feeds and free access to water. Pigs were loaded in three batches per compartment at an average weight of 118 kg live weight and kept overnight in a lairage at the slaughterhouse. The average age () of each batch was 164  172 and 185 days  respectively. During a 70-day period  pigs were slaughtered on 17 different days. Measurements on the carcass were recorded on one half of the carcass. Backfat () and loin depth () were measured at the 10 rib using the Hennessy grading probe HGP Systems Ltd  Auckland NZ). Lean percentage () was calculated as: PLEAN = 58.86 - (0.61 × BF) + (0.12 × LD). Cold carcass weight () was recorded after temperature equalization. Primal cuts of ham () and loin () were weighed and further dissected into boneless subprimals and individual muscles. Skin and fat were removed from hams removed and four subprimals were weighted: inside ham ()  outer ham ()  knuckle ham () and the lite butt ham ( . part of the  muscle). Together they summed to boneless ham muscle weight (). Loins were processed to a boneless loin without the fat cover (). Meat quality measurements were taken both on the loin and the ham. Ultimate pH () was measured in the boneless loin 24–28 h post mortem. Loin Minolta L*  a* and b* (   and ) were taken on the fresh cut surface of a 2.5-cm chop removed from the sirloin end using a Minolta CR 300 (Minolta  Osaka  Japan). The same chop was used for a subjective colour score (score 1 to 6  with 1 = pale and 6 = very dark) using the Japanese colour scale (). The side view of the loin was also scored using this scale (). A subjective marbling score (; 1 to 5  with 1 = devoid and 5 = overly abundant) was given to the chop based on marbling standards of the National Pork Producers Council []. Cores were taken from a second 2.5-cm chop using a 25-mm coring device to determine drip loss percentage (). Samples were weighed and put in pre-weighed tubes and stored in a cooler. After 24 h samples were reweighed and drip loss was calculated []. Purge loss (  %) was determined by weighing a 7.5- to 10-cm piece of the remainder of the boneless loin  cooling it for 5 days in plastic bags and reweighing. Subjective firmness scores (; 1 to 3  1 = soft and exudative and 3 = firm) were evaluated using NPPC standards []. Meat quality measurements taken on the ham included Minolta L*  a* and b* values on the fresh cut surface of the inside ham muscle (   and ). A subjective marbling score (; 1 to 4; 1 = devoid and 4 = abundant) was assigned to the outside ham muscle. General statistics regarding the data is given in van Wijk . []. DNA was extracted from ear or loin tissue samples using the Puregene DNA Isolation kit (D-70KA  Gentra Systems  Minneapolis  USA). Isolated DNA was tested on 1.2% agarose gel for quality and adjusted in NaCl-Tris-EDTA (STE) buffer to a final concentration of 15 ng/µL. Genotyping was performed in two batches. First eight half-sib families were typed for 10 microsatellite markers on SSC2 []. Next  nine additional families were genotyped for eight markers (out of the 10 markers previously used). Subsequently 16 microsatellite markers were added to fine-map regions on SSC2 based on preliminary analyses. All boars were genotyped for  and they were homozygous (A/A). The markers included in the statistical analysis are shown in Table . Genotypes were scored in duplicate and checked against pedigree information. Crimap 2.4 [] was used to construct a sex-average linkage map. Resulting recombination fractions/cM distances were used in Simwalk version 2.89 [] to reconstruct haplotypes  which were used in QTL analyses. Distances calculated with the Haldane linkage function were used in QTL analyses while distances calculated with the Kosambi linkage function are reported for comparison with QTL locations given in the literature []. QTL were mapped based on a combined linkage disequilibrium and segregation analysis using the variance component method because this method uses both the segregation from the sires and the dams  uses linkage disequilibrium among haplotypes in the founders  allows for simultaneously estimation of polygenic-  QTL-  litter- and fixed-effects and allows for complex pedigrees (half- and full-sib structure). Identity by descent (IBD) probabilities of haplotypes  using reconstructed haplotypes  were calculated using the LDLA package []  which is based on the theory developed by Meuwissen and Goddard []. IBD probability matrices were calculated at the midpoint of each bracket of flanking markers. The likelihood at each evaluation point was determined using ASREML []. For comparison reasons  models were also fitted ignoring the linkage disequilibrium (LA-only). Phenotypes were analysed according to the following model. Since the pedigree of the sows was not available a sire-dam model was used (one component model):  =  +  +  +  +   (1) where  is a vector containing phenotypic values   is a vector containing non-genetic effects   is a vector containing polygenic sire effects   is a vector containing common litter and dam effects   is a vector containing haplotype effects due to a putative QTL and  contains the residual effects. Non-genetic effects considered were a barn-group-batch  and sex as class variables and 'cold carcass weight' and 'days in the finishing barn' as linear covariables. The random effects of      and  were assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and variances      and   respectively where  is the genetic relationship matrix among the sires including five generations of known pedigree  is the IBD matrix among the haplotypes at evaluation point  and  is an identity matrix.      and  are incidence matrices relating effects to phenotypes. To relax the assumption of equal variance among the paternal and maternal haplotypes in model 1 the following model (2) was applied:  =  +  +  + ++ . (2) In model 2  a separate variance component is fitted for the paternal () and maternal () haplotypes (two-component model). Since the sires and the anonymous hybrid dams originated from different populations different QTL-alleles may be segregating at the QTL. To test the hypothesis of the presence of a QTL (H) versus no QTL (H) the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was applied. The LRT statistic at each midpoint between adjacent markers was calculated as twice the difference between the log likelihood of model 1 (or 2) minus the log likelihood of a model without a QTL effect. The test statistic plotted along the chromosome gave a LRT-profile. Given this profile  thresholds were calculated which take multiple testing across the chromosome into account using the method described by Piepho []. Since different likelihood profiles were obtained for each model and trait specific threshold values were obtained for each combination  significance was tested using this specific threshold. Genetic linkage maps are presented in Table . The order of the markers and the distance among markers is in close agreement with the USDA-MARC.2 genetic linkage map [] except for marker pair SWR1910-SWR783  which is reversed and separated by 14 cM instead of 1 cM. The average distance among the markers is 6 cM. The LRT statistics for traits that exceeded a Piepho-corrected threshold value of 0.05 and the position of their maximum value are given in Table . Depending on the trait analysed  the 0.05 threshold obtained corresponded with a nominal p-value of around 0.005. Few false positive QTL will be found at the expense of false negatives using these strict thresholds. Use of a commercial population that has been under selection for several decades might be another reason for the number of QTL observed in this study. Results are shown for the model applying a single variance component as well as for the two-component model  . allowing for different variances among paternal and among maternal haplotypes. The LRT statistics and position of the QTL were very similar for both models. LRT-profiles for meat quality traits with significant QTL are shown in Figure  using LRT-values from the two-component model. In Figure  similar profiles are shown for carcass quality traits. Applying an analysis using linkage information only (LA-only) showed fewer and less significant QTL (Table ). Especially for ham-related traits linkage disequilibrium information seems to be of added value. . Thresholds are corrected for multiple testing and averaged over traits; triangles on the X-axes indicate the location of the markers . Thresholds are corrected for multiple testing and averaged over traits; triangles on the X-axes indicate the location of the markers A significant QTL was observed for HAML. The estimated location differed slightly for the two models: 17 cM for the one-component model and 26 cM for the two-component model. Malek . [] also found a QTL for this trait on SSC2 but they were located at 72 and 116 cM. (The locations of QTL from other studies are taken from the pigQTLdb [] where all the map distances are converted to the USDA-MARC map). For HAMB no QTL have previously been reported on SSC2. The JCSrib QTL is in accordance with the QTL for a similar subjective colour score observed by Malek . [] although their score was on the cut surface of the loin instead of the side-rib-view. The QTL for HAMB and JCSrib were found at almost the same position  which might indicate that it is the same QTL affecting both traits. The QTL for pHu on SSC2 was observed between markers Sw1686 and Sw2167 (65 cM). Lee . [] observed two QTL for pHu on SCC2 at 42 and 64 cM in a F2-cross between Meishan and Pietrain. Su . [] observed a QTL for pHu at 67 cM. The ultimate pH is usually a good predictor of water holding capacity. Malek . [] showed that two QTL are segregating for this trait on SSC2 (around 75 and 114 cM). However  in this study no significant QTL were found for drip or purge. Figure  suggests that more than one QTL on SSC2 affect the amount of loin muscle (DLOIN). The most significant QTL for DLOIN at 73 cM on SSC2 has never been reported. Several studies have reported a QTL involving amount of loin at the beginning of SSC2  which is most likely associated with the -gene [        ]. However  Varona . [] and also Lee . [] have reported a QTL for loin depth and percentage lean cuts around 65 cM. Total kg of ham (HAM) as well as part of this ham (OHAM) showed a significant QTL at 103 cM  but the significant QTL for knuckle ham (KHAM) was situated at the end of SSC2. Duthie . [] have detected a QTL for ham weight on SCC2 at 15 cM like Vidal . [] but this latter study does not give the position. In Table   the proportion of total variance due to polygenic (h)  litter (c) and QTL (v) as well as the residual and total variance are given for traits mentioned in Table  at the evaluation point where the LRT for the QTL was at its maximum. Given the hybrid origin of the population used in this study  . a single strain sire line was crossed with a 3-way cross sow  the two-component model is probably more appropriate than the one-component model because in the two-component model the segregation of the paternal and maternal haplotypes are modelled as independent effects. This is illustrated in Table  where contribution of paternal and maternal components is given  . v and v. In general  proportions of variance due to polygenic and litter effects are in close agreement with van Wijk . [] in which data was analysed before marker data was available  . they applied a model without QTL effects. The biggest disagreement was observed when comparing the h estimates for pHu. The h for pHu dropped from 0.11 to 0.02. In both models  the QTL variance (v) is relatively high indicating that the genetic variance has shifted from polygenic to QTL variance. This might be the result of the specific data analysed. Since it is unlikely that a single QTL explains most of the genetic variance  the QTL variance is most likely overestimated. Different variance components for sire and dam haplotypes for HAMB and HAM indicate that the underlying QTL are not segregating in dam and sires  respectively. Preferably a two-component model should be applied for crossbred data where different QTL alleles could be segregating in different populations involved in the hybrid offspring. In this study  linkage disequilibrium (LD) information was included when calculating the IBD matrices. However  it is not clear how IBD due to LD should be calculated for crossbred populations. The theory developed by Meuwissen and Goddard [] assumes a single population 100 generations ago  which is not very likely for very different pig breeds. Uleberg . [] have applied an IBD-value of zero due to LD between base-haplotypes of different breeds. Given that all pigs originate from a domesticated wild boar population this seems to be too extreme because haplotypes could be identical by descent due to the single origin. Biodiversity studies  . Eding and Meuwissen []  which provide estimates of genetic distance among breeds  could be used to determine IBD within and between breeds simultaneously. Compared to Meuwissen . [] and Olsen . [] the LRT-profiles (Figures  and ) are less peaked. This might due to the lower marker density used in this study or to the use of cross bred data instead of single population data in the other studies  which have a positive effect on linkage disequilibrium information because IBD among founder haplotypes can be better estimated. In particular  the linkage disequilibrium information decreases the width of the peaks because it takes historic recombination into account []. QTL affecting meat and carcass quality were found on SSC2 in this large  commercially produced population. QTL-effects were significant even after correction for multiple testing. The variance component method to detect QTL made it possible to detect QTL segregating in the paternal line (. HAMB)  the maternal lines (. Ham) or in both (. pHu). Combining association and linkage information among haplotypes slightly improved the significance of the QTL compared to an analysis using linkage information only.

Genome-wide association studies of diseases and complex traits [] have permeated into animal breeding  and genome-assisted selection has become a major focus of research [  ]. However  genome-based artificial selection poses several challenges. For instance  methods for prediction of genetic merit or phenotype using a large number of markers must be contrasted and improved. Also  biological and economical advantages of genome-assisted selection in a breeding program must be quantified (this second problem is not addressed herein). A very important issue is how to deal with a much larger number of markers () than of individuals that are genotyped (). Some proposals include treating marker effects as random  with shrinkage of estimates of non-informative markers to zero. This is done naturally in a Bayesian context  where all unknowns are treated as random variables (.  Gianola and Fernando  []). On the one hand  Bayesian regression methods  such as Bayes A and Bayes B []  or the special case of Bayes A described by Xu [] have recently gained attention. However  all of these procedures involve strong assumptions a priori. On the other hand  non-parametric methods have been suggested as an alternative for predicting genomic breeding values  because these methods may require weaker assumptions when modeling complex quantitative traits []. These non-parametric approaches have been applied to simulated [] and field [] data  and results seem promising. The simulations from Gianola . [] involved 100 biallelic markers and additive × additive interactions between five pairs of loci. Gonzalez-Recio . [] used 24 pre-selected SNPs from a filter and wrapper feature subset selection algorithm [] in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression model. However  these non-parametric methods have not been tested yet using a large number of SNPs and field data. Inclusion of a large number of SNPs in these non-parametric models must be studied. Further  evaluating the accuracy of such methods in predicting phenotypes in future generations is a crucial issue in artificial selection programs. Genomic information became available in animal breeding recently  and most research involving either the large  small  problem [  ] or the prediction of future generations [  ] has resorted to simulations. Arguably  assumptions built in simulations may fail to represent the true complexity of biological systems and  typically  simulations tend to favor some of the models under evaluation. Therefore  the extent to which simulation results hold with real data can be questioned. The present paper uses field data from the Genomics Initiative Project at Aviagen Ltd. (Newbridge  UK). Food conversion rate () is one of the most economically important traits in the broiler industry  because it affects feeding and housing costs markedly. Genome-assisted selection programs may provide greater reliability of predictions of future performance  thus increasing profitability. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of Bayes A regression and of semi-parametric (RKHS) regression to predict yet-to-be observed phenotypes  using field data on FCR in a two-generation setting. Animal Care and Use Committee approval was not obtained for this study because the data were obtained from an existing database supplied by Aviagen Ltd. (Newbridge  UK). In a nutshell  a one-fold cross-validation with a training set and a testing set was carried out  as the testing set included only sons of sires that were in the training test. Several statistical methods were used to predict the average phenotypes of offspring of animals in the testing set  .  first-generation performance. These included a standard genetic evaluation  which ignored SNP genotypes  and two methods that included all available SNPs (after editing) as predictors in the model. The latter methods  which included genomic information  were Bayesian regression and RKHS regression. In addition  the RKHS regression approach was fitted with 400 pre-selected SNPs  where pre-selection was based on information gain using alternative criteria. In this section  the data set employed  the pre-selection of SNPs  and the statistical methods that were applied are described. Data consisted of average FCR records for progeny of each of 394 sires from a commercial broiler line in the breeding program of Aviagen Ltd. Prior to the analyses  the individual bird FCR records were adjusted for environmental and mate effects  as described in Ye . []. In order to assess the reliability of genome-assisted evaluation  two data sets (training and testing) were constructed. The testing set included offspring from sires with records in the training set. Sires included in the testing set were required to have sires in the training set with progeny records  and needed to have more than 20 progenies with FCR records  to have a reliable mean phenotype. Sires in the training and testing sets had an average of 33 and 44 progeny  respectively. Family size (half sibs) in the training set ranged between 1 and 284  with the mean and median being 32 and 17  respectively. Sixty-one sires (15.5% of the total) were included in the testing set  whereas the remaining 333 sires were in the training set. Predictions were calculated from the training set  and the accuracy of predicting the mean progeny phenotype was assessed using sons in the testing set. Genotypes consisted of 4505 SNPs chosen from the 2.8 million SNPs identified in the sequencing project of the chicken genome []. A data file titled \"Database of SNPs used in the Illumina Corp. chicken genotyping project\" (downloadable from ) describes partially the panel used  and further details on the 6 K panel can be found in Andreescu . []. All SNPs with monomorphic genotypes or with minor allele frequencies less than 5% were excluded. After editing  genotypes consisted of 3481 of the initial 4505 SNPs. Pre-selection of SNPs to be included in the analyses was performed using the information gain or entropy reduction criterion [  ]. Information gain is the difference in entropy of a probability distribution before and after observing genotypes  .  it measures how much uncertainty is reduced by observation of SNP genotypes. The entropy of the probability distribution of a discrete random variable Y is defined as: where A is the set of all states that Y can take  and the logarithm is on base 2 to mimic bits of information. The above pertains to a discrete distribution since entropy is not well defined in the continuous case []. Here  Y refers to FCR phenotypes that were discretized by considering different number of classes of FCR and different cutpoints  as follows. First  two extreme FCR classes (\"low\" and \"high\") were set up using cutpoints corresponding to the a and (1-a) quantiles (a = 0.15  0.20  0.25  0.35 and 0.40) of the FCR phenotypes for sires in the training set. Further  an additional \"middle\" class (FCR between percentiles 0.40 and 0.60) was included to enrich the discretized data. In total  information gain was calculated in ten subsets  corresponding to combinations of the five 'extreme' tail a-values  with or without the intermediate class. For each SNP  the training set was divided into three subsets corresponding to the three possible genotypes (aa  Aa or AA). For each genotype  there are  sires with genotype  in the high class   sires with genotype  in the low class  and possibly  sires with genotype  in the middle class  if included. The information gain for each SNP  ( = 1 2  ...  3481) was the change in entropy after observing the genotypes  calculated as: where . Note that  = 0 if a middle class was not included. The 400 SNPs with largest information gain in each of the ten partitions were pre-selected to build up a 400-SNP genotype for each sire. Note that the choice of the 400 SNPs was arbitrary  but it roughly represents 10% of the initial SNPs. Let  (333 × 1) be the vector of mean adjusted FCR records for progeny of sires in the training set. Three different methods for prediction of genomic breeding values for FCR were used  as described next. A Bayesian equivalent of empirical best linear unbiased prediction of sires' transmitting abilities  as described by Henderson []  was used. This method uses pedigree data as the only source of genetic information. The linear model was:  =   +  +  where   is an unknown mean;  is a vector of ones;  = {} is a vector of sire effects; is the effect of sire  in the pedigree ( = 1  2  ...  624) and  is an incidence matrix of order 333 × 624 linking  to the observed data. A priori  the sire effects were assumed to be distributed as  ~(  )  where  is the additive relationship matrix between sires  and  is the variance between sires. The residuals    were assumed to be distributed as (   = )  where  = {} is a diagonal matrix with elements representing the number of progeny of sire  and  is the residual variance. This dispersion structure for  weights the residuals according to the number of progeny each sire has [  ]. Independent scaled inverted chi-square prior distributions were assigned to the sire and residual variances as  and   respectively  where = 5 and = 3 correspond to the degrees of freedom  and  = 0.1 and  = 8.67 were the corresponding scale parameters. Sire merit (transmitting ability) was inferred using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Meuwissen . [] have proposed a Bayesian model in which the additive effects of chromosome segments marked by SNPs follow a normal distribution with a segment-specific variance. These variances are assigned a common scaled inverted chi-square prior distribution. The model fitted in this study had the form:  =   +  + . Here   is a 333 × 1 vector of progeny means for adjusted FCR   is their mean value  and  is a column vector of ones;  = {} is a vector of 3481 × 1 SNP effects  and is the regression coefficient on the additive effect of SNP  ( = 1  2  ...  3481). Elements of the incidence matrix   of order  ×  ( = 333;  = 3481)  were set up as for an additive model  with values -1  0 or 1 for    and   respectively. The effects were assumed normally and independently distributed a priori as N(0  )  where  is an unknown variance specific to marker . The prior distribution of each  was assumed to be (  ) with  = 4 and  = 0.01. The residuals () were assumed to be distributed as (  )  with  constructed as in the previous model. A RKHS regression [–] is a semi-parametric approach that allows inference regarding functions  e.g.  genomic breeding values  without making strong prior assumptions. As described in Gianola and van Kaam [] and González-Recio . [] in the context of genome-assisted selection  this model can be formulated as:  =  +  +   where the first term () is a parametric term with ß as a vector of systematic effects or nuisance parameters (only  was fitted in this case  since the data were pre-corrected)  and  is an incidence matrix (here a vector of ones  ). The non-parametric term is given by   where is a positive definite matrix of kernels  possibly dependent on a bandwidth parameter ()  and a is vector of non-parametric coefficients that are assumed to be distributed as   with  representing the reciprocal of a smoothing parameter ( = ). The residuals  were assumed to be distributed as  ~(0  )  with  as for the previous models. It can be shown that  given  and   the RKHS regression solutions satisfy the linear system: There are two key issues in the RKHS regression pertaining to the non-parametric term: choosing the matrix of kernels  and tuning the  and  parameters. The matrix of kernels aims to measure \"distances\" between genotypes. This matrix had dimension 333 × 333  with rows in the form    = 1  2  ...  333  where (- ) is the kernel involving the genotypes of sires  and . The kernel refers to any smooth function for distances between objects  such that (- ) = 0. Different types of kernels may be used []. A Gaussian kernel was chosen in this research  with form:   where (- ) is a measurement of distance between genotypes of sires  and   and  is a bandwidth parameter. The choice of  and of the measurement of distance between genotypes must be done cautiously. A generalized (direct) cross validation procedure was used to tune   as described in Wahba . []. However  measuring distances between genotypes is less straightforward  because a large variety of criteria might be used for this purpose (e.g. Gianola . []; Gianola and van Kaam  []; Gonzalez-Recio .  []). The algorithm used to measure distances between genotypes is given next. Let and be string sequences of SNP genotypes for sires  and   respectively. These strings can be separated into  substrings in which all SNPs differ between the two sequences. For example  suppose = (AABbCCDDEeFFGg)  and = (AabbCcDDEeffgg). Here  there are two substrings that differ from each other completely  corresponding to SNPs from loci 1–3  and 6–7 (table ). Then  compute the sum of the logarithms in base 2 (interpreted as bits of information) of the dissimilarity between substrings. Dissimilarity was defined as the number of alleles differing at each SNP. Hence  distance between two genotypes can be expressed as: where is the number of different alleles in substring . In the example  sires  and  differ in one allele at each SNP (AA  Aa  Bb  bb  and CC  Cc) in substring 1. In substring 2  sires  and  differ in 2 alleles for the first SNP (FF  ff) and in 1 allele for the second SNP (Gg  gg). Here  the two substrings had distances  =  = 3. A modification of this system was used for models in which SNPs were pre-selected using the information gain score. Here  the number of different alleles at each SNP was weighted by the information gain score at that locus. Therefore  the distance between two genotypes was calculated as:   where and are column vectors with typical elements equal to the information gain score and the number of different alleles  respectively  for each SNP in substring . This kernel weights dissimilarity between SNPs by the reduction in entropy. With this approach  the kernel matrix  is symmetric and positive definite  so it fulfills the requirements of a RKHS  and it can be viewed as a correlation matrix between genomic combinations. In total  11 RKHS regression analyses were performed: one including all 3481 SNPs; five (a = 0.15  0.20  0.25  0.35 and 0.40) including 400 pre-selected SNPs using the information gain calculated using two (\"low\" and \"high\") classes to classify sires  and five (a = 0.15  0.20  0.25  0.35 and 0.40) including 400 pre-selected SNPs with information gain calculated by classifying sires into three (\"low\"  \"medium\" and \"high\") classes. Posterior estimates from all models were obtained with a Gibbs sampling algorithm based on 150 000 iterations  discarding the first 50 000 as burn-in  and keeping all 100 000 subsequent samples for inferences. Progeny phenotypes in the testing set were predicted using the estimates obtained from the training set. First  using the training set with each model  inferences were made regarding the predicted transmitting ability for E- BLUP  prediction of SNPs coefficients for Bayes A  and prediction of non-parametric coefficients for RKHS regression. Phenotypes in the testing set were predicted as follows: Phenotypes were predicted using pedigree indexes via sire and maternal grandsire (information from maternal relatives was not included). The pedigree index for sire  in the testing set () was   where and are the predicted transmitting abilities of the bird's sire and maternal grandsire  respectively. The  = 3481 estimates of regressions coefficients corresponding to additive effects of the SNPs () from the training set were multiplied by their respective genotype codes (= -1  0 or 1 for aa  Aa or AA  respectively) for sire  in the testing set to obtain a predicted phenotype as   where  and  are the posterior means of  and   respectively. Predictions were made using a matrix of kernels between focal points (i.e.  genotypes of sires in the testing set) and support vectors (genotypes of sires in the training set) as: where * () is a matrix with dimension 61 × 333  and with rows of the form    = 1  2  ...  333  where  is the kernel between the genotype of sire  in the testing set and sire  in the training set. The same bandwidth parameter that was tuned with the training set was used. The vector  represented the posterior means of the 333 non-parametric regression coefficients for sires in the training sample. Typically  the objective of prediction in animal breeding is to rank candidates for selection  and to subsequently choose the highest-ranked candidates as parents of the next generation. Spearman correlations (r) were calculated between predicted and observed phenotypes of sires in the testing set for all methods. Confidence intervals of the correlation estimates were formed using bootstrapping [  ] for each method. Pairs  defined as the predicted phenotypes in the testing set and its corresponding observed (known) phenotype  were assumed to be from an independent and identically distributed population. Then  10 000 pairs were drawn with replacement from the whole testing set  and the Spearman correlation was computed in each of the bootstrap samples. Further  computing times for running the first 10 000 samples were tested for Bayes A and for RKHS regression using all 3481 SNPs in a HPxw6000 workstation with a 2.4 GHz × 2 processor and 2 Gb RAM. A Gauss-Seidel algorithm with residual updates [] was used in the Bayes A method  as suggested by Legarra and Misztal []. The solving effect-by-effect strategy described in Misztal and Gianola [] was adapted to compute the RKHS regressions. Mean adjusted FCR was 1.23 in the training set  with a standard deviation of 0.1. The posterior mean of heritability was 0.21 with the E-BLUP model. This estimate was similar to those reported by Gaya . [] and Pym and Nicholls []  but higher than that of Zhang . []. The posterior mean (standard deviation) of the residual variance was estimated at 1.17 (0.22) and 0.50 (0.12) with Bayes A and RKHS  respectively  using all 3481 SNPs in each case. Notably  analyses using RKHS regression on 400 pre-selected SNPs produced a slightly smaller posterior mean of the residual variance than analyses based on all 3481 SNPs. Almost half of the 400 pre-selected SNPs were selected consistently  regardless of the criterion used for classifying sires. About 60% of the remaining SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD)  measured with the r statistic  between criterions. The most discrepant case (2 classes and a = 0.30  vs. 3 classes and a = 0.25) is shown in Figure  (LD between and within selected SNPs from each criterion). This figure contains the 400 SNPs selected with each of those cases. For each case  the SNPs are sorted according their position in the genome. This map shows that most of the SNPs that were pre-selected with one criterion had strong \"proxy\" SNPs that were pre-selected with the other criterion  as the dark points in the diagonal of the left-upper square indicate. Physical locations in the genome were also close (results not shown). . Table  and Figure  show descriptive statistics (mean  standard deviation  and confidence interval) and box plots  respectively  of the bootstrap distribution of Spearman correlations. The pedigree index (E-BLUP) was the least accurate predictor of phenotypes in the testing set ( = 0.11). All analyses using genomic information outperformed E-BLUP. Results for Bayes A and RKHS regression using all available SNPs were similar  attaining an average Spearman correlation of 0.27. Size of confidence regions was similar as well. . RKHS regression with pre-selected SNPs was always more accurate than E-BLUP  and it was also more accurate than either whole-genome Bayes A or whole-genome RKHS in 7 out of 12 comparisons. However  the bootstrap confidence intervals overlapped to some extent. Analyses performed with SNPs that were pre-selected using only sires from the low and high classes tended to have better predictive abilities ( > 0.33) than analyses that involved an additional middle class  except for the setting with a = 0.30 ( = 0.19). Analyses that included SNPs that were pre-selected based on information gain from three classes (low  medium and high) were more variable  although confidence bands overlapped. Four out of six analyses produced poorer predictions than either Bayes A or RKHS using all 3481 SNPs. This is probably due to the lower information gain obtained when separating sires into 3 classes. However  SNPs that were pre-selected using 3 classes and a = 0.25 had the best predictive ability  with an almost 4-fold improvement in prediction accuracy relative to E-BLUP. Pre-selection of SNPs reduces noise when measuring genomic differences  because non-informative SNPs are not considered. Furthermore  with pre-selected SNPs  this kernel placed more weight on informative SNPs. Other methods of pre-selecting SNPs are available and should be tested as well. Among these  the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO; [])  or its Bayesian counterpart [] are appealing and yield predicted genomic values directly. Bayes A and RKHS regression using all SNPs had similar predictive ability  even though these methods are very different from each other. Bayesian regression shrinks weakly informative SNPs towards zero  whereas RKHS regression makes weaker a priori assumptions and focuses on prediction of outcomes. Bayes A is also highly dependent on the prior distribution assigned to the variances of regression coefficients. Different scale parameters and degrees of belief for the (  ) distribution produced very different predictive abilities (only the best choice was shown in this study). The large   small   problem plays an important role in Bayes A  and posterior estimates are greatly affected by the choice of hyper-parameters in the prior distribution. Meuwissen . [] chose their prior distribution for the variances of regression coefficients based on their simulation. This choice is not straightforward with real data. Hence  an extra layer is missing in the hierarchy of Bayes A. For example  markers on the same chromosome could be assigned the same prior variance  such that for chromosome   the conditional posterior distribution of  would have + degrees of freedom. The RKHS regression approach  on the other hand  is less dependent on priors  and it can also be implemented in a non-Bayesian manner. Nonetheless  two issues must be considered carefully in RKHS: the choice of the bandwidth parameter () and of the kernel (i.e.  how to measure genomic differences). Generalized cross-validation or jackknife methods are broadly accepted for tuning smoothing parameters. In this study  the same bandwidth parameter was used in the training and testing sets  although tuning a specific parameter for each set is an option to be explored. However  measuring genomic differences (non-Euclidean distances) may be done in different ways  each yielding different predictive ability. The kernel described in this research performed best among several kernels that were tested. To be effective in prediction of phenotypes in future generations  a proper kernel function must be used. Furthermore  correct tuning of the smoothing parameter is needed. As knowledge on the genome increases  more suitable kernels may be designed. Since strong assumptions are used in parametric models (e.g.  regarding dominance or epistasis)  RKHS regression is expected to produce better predictions for complex traits because it may deal with crude  noisy  redundant and inconsistent information. Computing times for the first 10 000 samples were 1398.6 and 110.88 CPU seconds for whole-genome Bayes A and whole-genome RKHS regression  respectively. Thus  the semi-parametric regression was 12.6 times faster  and computing time does not depend on the number of SNPs but  rather  on the number of animals that were genotyped. This is because the matrix of kernels is  ×   where  is the number of animals genotyped  irrespective of the number of SNPs. Computing time in Bayes A depends on the number of SNPs (or haplotypes) that are genotyped  because these influence the number of conditional distributions that must be sampled. Gibbs sampling may mix poorly  and methods including a Metropolis-Hastings step  such as Bayes B []  might be prohibitive from a computational point of view when  is large. Further  convergence should be tested carefully in field data with Bayesian regression methods  as pointed out by ter Braak . []. Other authors have evaluated predictive ability of models including genomic information in different scenarios. Gonzalez-Recio . [] analyzed a lowly heritable trait (chicken mortality) in a similar population using different parametric and non-parametric approaches. These authors found a higher predictive ability for RKHS regression than for other methods  including the Bayesian regression model proposed by Xu []  which is similar to Bayes A. However  this study differed in some respects from the present research. For example  genomic differences between genotypes in the kernel utilized by Gonzalez-Recio . [] were computed from only 24 pre-selected SNPs based on the filter-wrapper feature subset algorithm of Long . []. Also  predictive ability was assessed on current phenotypes  and not on phenotypes of future generations  as it was the case in the present study. Other authors using real data  such as a study in mice []  found that methods incorporating genomic information produced more accurate phenotypic predictions than BLUP in a model with independent families. This research indicated that prediction accuracy of genetic evaluations can be enhanced by incorporating genomic data into breeding programs for a moderate heritability trait  such as FCR in broilers. This is one of the most important traits in the broiler industry from an economical point of view  and genome-assisted selection may help increase profitability in breeding and commercial flocks []. Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression can handle a large number of markers without making strong assumptions  and the tandem approach of pre-selection of SNPs for subsequent use in RKHS regression seems to be an appealing approach  as found in this study. Pre-selection may be useful in the development of assays with fewer number of SNPs. Pre-selection of SNPs may be performed from a large battery of SNPs  genotyped on a restricted number of sires with a large number of progeny. Genotyping of animals on a greater scale may become more affordable if a smaller number of informative SNPs is included on a chip. Subsequently  semi-parametric methods can be used in conjunction with these SNPs to predict future phenotypes with high accuracy.

The recent detection of thousands to millions of SNP markers and the dramatic improvements in high-throughput  cost effective genotyping technology have made it possible to apply marker assisted selection at a genome wide scale  which is termed genomic selection []. These authors suggested three methods for the estimation of genetic value from dense SNP marker data  namely GS-BLUP  BayesA  and BayesB. GS-BLUP applies the BLUP approach to the estimation of the effects of the marker alleles  which assumes a normal prior distribution for the marker effects  where the variance of the prior distribution was assumed equal for all the markers. Since an equal variance for each of the marker effects seems unrealistic  the BayesA method extended the GS-BLUP method by estimating the variance of every marker separately  and an inverse chi-square prior was used for the estimation of these variances. In the BayesB method it was assumed that many of the markers will actually have no effect  and the prior distribution of the variances was a mixture of a distribution with zero variance and an inverse chi-squared distribution. In a simulation study where the genetic model included a finite number of loci with exponentially distributed effects  BayesB provided more accurate prediction of genetic value than BayesA  which in turn was more accurate than GS-BLUP. Although BayesB has the potential for the development of more faithful genetic models  and so seems the method of choice for estimating genome wide breeding values (GW-EBV)  its calculation requires the use of computer intensive MCMC techniques. For practical applications and for computer simulations of genomic selection breeding schemes  where many selection rounds and replications are required  it would be advantageous if a much faster algorithm for the calculation of BayesB GW-EBV would be available. Thus  our aim here is to present a fast non-MCMC based algorithm for the calculation of BayesB type estimates of GW-EBV. By using a mixture of a distribution with zero effects and an exponential distribution as a prior for the marker effects  the integration involved in calculating the expectation of the breeding values given the data can be solved analytically  which makes non-MCMC estimation of GW-EBV possible. We will first develop a model for the estimation of the effect of one SNP. The model will be extended to m SNPs in the fourth section of Methods  where m will be assumed to be much larger than the number of records n. When estimating one SNP effect  we generally do not need to use prior information  since the prior will usually be overwhelmed by the information from the data. However  since we will be extending the model to the estimation of many SNP effects  we will use prior information here. Also  in order to facilitate expansion to multi-SNP models we assume that the SNP considered is a randomly chosen SNP with a random effect  instead of a particular SNP with some particular effect. We will assume that a SNP marker has two alleles  0 and 1  with allele 1 the reference allele having frequency p. For the purpose of estimating gene effects  the SNP genotypes were standardised to form an n × 1 vector of covariates    defined for animal i as: (1) b = -2p/SD  if i has homozygous genotype '0_0'; (2) b = (1–2p)/SD if i has heterozygote genotype '0_1'; (3) b = 2(1-p)/SD if i has homozygous genotype '1_1'; where SD = v[2p(1-p)]. Thus  the b are standardised such that their mean is 0 and their variance is 1 in a random mating population. If g is the effect of the SNP in the population  and we assume that it is drawn from a distribution of marker effects with mean 0  then the variance due to the marker is Var(bg) = Var(b)Var(g) = Var(g). Therefore by modelling the variance of the effect of the SNP  we also model the variance directly due to the SNP  irrespective of its frequency. This way of modelling the variance due to the SNP will be discussed in detail in Discussion. It may be noted however that the standardisation of the variance of the b is not essential to our derivations below  . when considered more appropriate we could choose the b as -2p  (1–2p)  and 2(1-p)  respectively. The model for the records denoted by the n × 1 vector  is:  =   +  (1) where g is the effect of the SNP; and  is an n × 1 vector of residuals which are assumed normally distributed with variance . We will ignore the estimation of an overall mean for now since  even if it were included in the model  its estimate would not affect the equation for the estimation of g since  = 0  following from the standardisation of . The prior distribution of the SNP effect g  ()  is assumed to be a mixture of a distribution with a discrete probability mass of zero and an exponential distribution reflected about g = 0 (see []): where  is the fraction of the SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) and may consequently have a non-zero effect; and  is the parameter of the exponential distribution. As described in the Appendix 1 this may be re-expressed as  where () is the Dirac delta function. Therefore since the variance of the zero-reflected exponential distribution is 2  for m markers the total genetic variance is  = 2. Covariances between marker effects are expected to be zero  because any non-zero covariance will depend on the coding of the marker alleles which is arbitrary  . a positive covariance can be changed in a negative one by recoding the marker alleles. The hyper-parameters of the prior distribution ( and ) are assumed known here. If one is willing to assume that a fraction  of the markers are in LD with QTL  the variance per marker in LD with a QTL is /(m)  and an estimate of the  hyper-parameter is v(2 m/). For the likelihood of the data  given the genetic effect g a multi-variate normal distribution is assumed with mean  g and variance   from (2)  where  is the n × n identity matrix. Thus  the likelihood function is (;    )  where (;   ) is the multi-variate normal density function with mean  and (co)variance matrix . In what follows the dimensionality of the multi-variate (.;. .) will be left implicit from the parameters and will include the univariate density. The summary statistic for g is Y = () =  n and  consequently  all information on g contained in  is also contained in Y. The variance of Y is  = () = /n since  = n. Therefore  the likelihood function (;    ) is proportional to the univariate density (;   )  as shown in Appendix 2  and so we will use the univariate version of the likelihood function for simplicity. The posterior distribution of g| now becomes: The posterior distribution is not affected by the use of either (;    ) or (;   ) since they are proportional to each other  . (;    )/(;   ) = constant  and this constant is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator. The expectation of g given  is (. []) as  [|] = <U+222B> (|) and thus: Both the integral in the numerator and that in the denominator are analytically derived in full in Appendix 1. This results in a closed form for E [g|]  which is presented in the Appendix 1 in Equation (B3). The extension to the estimation of the effects of m SNPs is obtained by the use of a modification of the Iterative Conditional Mode (ICM) algorithm []  which we will call the Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) algorithm. The ICE algorithm uses the expectation/mean instead of the mode of the posterior  because (1) the mean of g maximises the correlation between  and []; and (2) due to the spike at zero the posterior may be bi-modal (see Results)  in which case the mode may be quite far away from the mean. The ICE algorithm iteratively calculates E(g|Y) for each SNP in turn  using the current solutions of all the other SNPs as if they were true effects  which is known to only approximately converge to the correct solution. We will first describe the algorithm and next its approximate nature. The effects of the SNPs are denoted g (i = 1  ..  m)  and in vector notation by . When estimating the effect of the i SNP  the current estimates of all other SNPs are used to calculate Y and . Iterating from a starting solution  .  = 0  the algorithm performs within each iteration the following steps: For all SNPs i = 1  ..  m  Step 1: calculate 'adjusted' records    which are corrected for all the other SNPs so . Estimate the sufficient statistics   and  = /n. Step 2: Equation B3 of Appendix 1 is used to calculate  =  [|]  which is used to update the solution for marker i. The iteration is stopped when the changes in the solutions become small  .   where subscript q denotes the q iteration. In the Step 1  it is computationally more efficient to calculate Y directly as . The advantage being that the elements of the normal equations matrix  may be stored  which speeds up the calculation of Y. As mentioned before  if the only fixed effect is the overall mean  no correction for fixed effects is needed. If it is required to estimate fixed effects  with design matrix   the calculation of  in the Step 1 becomes  and each iteration also updates the solutions for the fixed effects . by . The approximate nature of the ICE algorithm is due to and thus Y not being known  but being estimated. For ease of notation  this was not denoted by a hat elsewhere in this paper  but in this paragraph it is necessary to make the distinction between the true values of =  - Sand and their estimates:  and   which are calculated as indicated above. Estimation errors in  and  occur due to the estimation errors of the other SNP effects  ( <U+2260> )  which is reflected by their Prediction Error Variance  PEV(). From a second order Taylor series expansion of E(g|Y) around its mean   it follows that: where () is due to prediction error variances and covariances of the g. It follows that (|) ˜ (|)  as is implicitly assumed in step 2 of the ICE algorithm  if the second derivative of E(g|Y) is small or () is small. The latter is probably only the case if there are few markers  <U+2260> . The first section of Results investigates the non-linearity  . second and higher order derivatives  of the E(g|Y) function. The BayesB algorithm developed here will be denoted by fBayesB (for 'fast BayesB') and the BayesB algorithm using MCMC (as described in []) will be denoted by MBayesB. fBayesB and MBayesB were compared in twenty simulated populations. The simulation of the population and analysis by MBayesB was conducted by Solberg . [] and their paper gives a detailed description of the simulation procedures. In brief  the populations were simulated for 1000 generations at an effective size of 100 in order to create mutation drift balance and LD between the markers and the genes. The genome consisted of 10 chromosomes of 100 cM with a total of 8010 equidistant marker loci including markers at each end of the chromosome. The mutation rate per marker locus per meiosis was high (2.5*10) to ensure that virtually all the loci were segregating. If more than one mutation occurred at a marker locus  the mutation that resulted in the highest Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) was considered as 'visible'  whereas the others were considered 'unvisible' and were thus ignored. With these parameters  the visibility procedure turned 99% of markers into biallelic markers  even if several mutations had occurred  with the remaining 1% being monoallelic. There were 1000 equidistant putative QTL positions  which were chosen such that a QTL position was always in the middle between two marker loci. Whether or not a putative QTL position had an effect on the trait depended on the existence of a mutation during the simulated generations  which occurred with a mutation rate of 2.5*10. The effects of QTL alleles were sampled from a gamma distribution with scale parameter 1.4 and shape parameter 4.2  and were considered with equal probabilities of being positive or negative. The scale parameter of the gamma distribution was chosen such that the expected genetic variance was 1 (as in []). In generation 1001 and 1002 the population size was increased to 1000  and the animals were genotyped for the 8010 markers. In generation 1001  the animals also had phenotypic records  . the phenotype of animal i was: = S(+ ) +  where a is the effect of the paternal (m  maternal) allele that animal i inherited at QTL locus j; e~N(0  )  where  was set equal to the realised genetic variance in the replicate  such that the heritability was 0.5 in each replicate. Marker effects were estimated using the phenotypes and genotypes obtained from generation 1001. The total genetic values for the animals of generation 1002 were predicted (GW-EBV) from their marker genotypes and the estimates of the marker effects. The accuracy of these estimates was calculated as the correlation between the GW-EBV and the true breeding value  which is known in this simulation study. The coefficient of the regression of the true genetic value on the GW-EBV was used as a measure of the bias of the EBV  and a regression coefficient of 1 implies no bias. In Figure   E [g|Y] is plotted against the value of Y with  = 1; since Y is the sufficient statistic for g given the data   E [g|] = E [g|Y]. Figure  shows also the regression curve when the integrals in Equation () were numerically evaluated  as was done by Goddard []. The empirical curve of Goddard has similar characteristics  which is relatively flat at Y = 0  but approaches a derivative of 1 for extreme values of Y. However as a result of the closed expression in Appendix 1 (B3) it is possible to explore the full solution space and Figure  shows some examples from this space. The examples demonstrate several features. Firstly E [g|Y] is an odd function (in a mathematical sense) satisfying E [g| -Y] = -E [g|Y]. Secondly   [|]/ is non-zero at Y = 0 but decreases towards 0 as  tends to 0. Furthermore  [|]/ is not necessarily monotonic  for example see  = 0.05 in Figure . In the example with  = 0.05 it is clear that  [|]/ exceeds 1 for Y ˜ 3.5 . an increment in Y results in a greater increment in E [g|Y]. Heuristically this occurs because for small  there are only few non zero marker effects  but those present are large; therefore E [g|Y] is close to 0  since Y is expected to have occurred by chance  until Y becomes large and statistically unusual in magnitude  but once considered unusual  E [g|Y] is large. Asymptotically  for Y of large magnitude  [|]/ tends to 1. The asymptotic behaviour of E(g|Y) is: . The parameter of the exponential distribution is  = 1   = 1  and the probability of a marker having a true effect is  = 0.05; E(g|Y) calculated by numerical integration is represented by black dots and the analytical solution is shown as white dots. . The parameter of the exponential distribution is  = 1   = 1  and the probability of a marker having a true effect is  = 0.05 ()  0.5 (dotted curve)  and 1.0 (regular line). This is nominally independent of   but for a given  the value of  will increase as  increases. Assuming that all the genetic variance can be explained by markers  and the trait has a phenotypic variance of 1 and heritability h  . In summary  the effect is that for small Y values the estimates of g are regressed back substantially  whereas the regression back for large values of Y is diminishing and small. The non-linearity of E [g|Y] is especially pronounced for small   and the second derivative seems positive (negative) for positive (negative) values of Y that are approximately between -4 < Y < 4. Since most Y values (expressed in  units) will be between these boundaries  the regression E [g|Y] is quite non-linear. For multiple SNPs  Equation () suggests that the estimates of g will be conservative in the sense that they will show a bias towards zero. This bias will be increased for smaller   . for a smaller number of QTL over number of markers ratio. Figure  depicts the prior  likelihood and posterior distribution of g  in a situation where the posterior is bimodal. For smaller values of Y  the likelihood curve moves to the left and the two peaks of the posterior merge into one. For larger values of Y  the likelihood moves to the right  hence its value at 0 reduces  and the peak of the posterior at zero disappears. In the latter case  the posterior becomes approximately a symmetric distribution  and the use of the mode (ICM) instead of the mean (ICE) would not make much difference. . The parameter from the exponential distribution  = 1.67   = 0.1  and Y = 0.2 (s.d. units); the spike of the prior distribution at zero is depicted by an exponential distribution  that is reflected around zero  with a very large  of 200. MBayesB is slightly more accurate than fBayesB (Table ). The difference in accuracy is 0.011 with s.e. of difference of 0.005  which is statistically significant. For comparison  the accuracy of BLUP GW-EBV is also shown  calculated with a prior that each marker contributes an equal amount of variance  namely 1/m  . the infinitesimal model is assumed to hold  at least approximately. The accuracy of the BLUP GW-EBV is considerably lower than that of MBayesB and fBayesB  which is probably because the genetic model underlying the simulations is quite far from the infinitesimal model. Both MBayesB and fBayesB yielded biased EBV  but  interestingly  the biases are opposite in direction. MBayesB yields EBV that are too variable  so the EBV require to be shrunk in order to predict the TBV without bias  hence the regression of the TBV on the EBV is <1. In contrast  fBayesB yields EBV with too little variance  so the EBV require to be scaled up in order to predict the TBV without bias  . the regression is >1. This conservative behaviour of   . differences between the estimates are smaller than the real life differences  is expected based on the non-linearity observed in Figure  and Equation () (see first section of Results). Especially  the bias of the fBayesB is considerable  and should be corrected for by rescaling the EBV when used in a breeding scheme where EBVs based on different amounts of information are to be compared. In order to investigate any systematic deviations of fBayesB-EBV from the MBayesB-EBV  which is considered the golden standard  Figure  plots both types of EBV against each other. The regression of the EBV from both types of non-linear regression methods against each other seems pretty linear  which indicates that both methods seem to non-linearly regress the phenotypic data in a very similar way. . The difference in computer time is large: whereas fBayesB takes 2 to 5 minutes MBayesB takes 47 h to compute. No attempt was made to implement parallel computing with MBayesB  although it is readily amenable to parallel procedures through running multiple shorter MCMC chains (each chain should be longer than the burn-in period)  which reduces the required wall-time for the calculations. The impact of parallel computing procedures of fBayesB is less clear  but there also appears to be no need for this. A fast  non-MCMC based algorithm  called Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE)  was derived for the calculation of GW-EBV using dense SNP genotype and phenotypic data. The speed of improvement is due to the analytical integration of the integrals involved in the calculation of E [g|Y]. The Bayesian estimation model used here has very similar characteristics to BayesB as described by [] and denoted MBayesB here: the prior distribution is a mixture of a heavy-tailed distribution (fBayesB: exponential distribution; MBayesB: a normal distribution whose variance is sampled from an inverse chi-squared) and a distribution with zero effects. The latter mixture distribution is also called a 'spike and slab' mixture []. The QTL effects had a Gamma distribution  and thus differed from both that of fBayesB and MBayesB. It may be noted that the prior distribution of fBayesB and MBayesB does not apply to the QTL effects but to the marker effects  for which the true prior distribution will be hard to derive. Although we cannot rule out that the slightly better accuracy of MBayesB compared to fBayesB (Table ) is due to the prior distribution of MBayesB being better than that of fBayesB  the non-linear regressions of MBayesB and fBayesB seemed very similar since they resulted in a linear regression of the fBayesB-EBV on the MBayesB-EBV (Figure ). The difference in accuracy seems to be due to that the ICE algorithm ignores higher order derivatives of E(g|Y) function to Y (Eqn. 5). Relaxing this assumption requires (1) taking second order derivatives of the E(g|Y) function  (2) calculation of prediction error variances of   and more research is needed to perform these calculations computationally efficiently. The justification for the 'spike and slab' prior distribution is that many of the SNPs will not be in LD with a QTL and thus have no effect  whereas the SNPs that are in LD with a QTL have a distribution of effects that is similar to that of the QTL  albeit smaller in magnitude due to the need for several markers to predict the effect of the true QTL genotypes. The true distribution of QTL is often reported to be exponential or gamma []. Hayes and Goddard [] found a shape parameter for the gamma distribution of 0.4  . a leptokurtic shape similar to that of the exponential distribution. Where the marker is not in perfect LD with the gene  it will pick up only a fraction of the gene effect and the impact of this on the distribution of marker effects is included within the assumptions concerning their prior distribution. The non-linear regression curve  resulting from the choice of the prior distribution  is rather flat for values of Y close to 0  but approaches a ratio of E [g|Y]/Y = 1 for Y of large magnitude  so E [g|Y] ˜ Y albeit for very large  and hence rare  deviations. Thus large values of Y are assumed to represent true marker effects  whereas small values are regressed back substantially  . are unlikely to represent a true effect. In contrast  if Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) of marker effects is used  . a normal prior distribution of the marker effects  the regression does not depend on Y and is a constant equal to /( + )  . E(g|Y) = Y* /( + )  where  is the variance of the marker effects  which will be /m. This distinction is due to the use of the normal prior instead of the exponential and  as a consequence  the heavier tails giving credence to large marker effects. Nevertheless the high value of E [g|Y]/Y when using the exponential prior may not be a desirable effect  if outlier data points are encountered. The variance due to a marker is Var(\"Marker\") = Var(b)Var(g). Here we standardised the variance of the genotypes to Var(b) = 1  . the prior variance assumed for the marker effects  g  applies directly for the variance due to the marker  and thus does not depend on marker frequency. We prefer this parameterisation  assuming that the variance of the marker effects is frequency dependent  because (1) QTL with large effects are expected to be at rare frequencies  which implies that the variance of the QTL is roughly constant (at least considerably more constant than when QTL effects were not frequency dependent); (2) if we assume that the QTL variance needs to be above a certain threshold before the markers pick up its effect  these QTL will have a much more constant variance than randomly picked QTL. The algorithm is equally capable of handling the coding of b as 0  1  and 2  (or after subtracting the mean -2p  (1–2p)  and 2(1-p)) for the genotypes mm  Mm  and MM  respectively. The accuracies of the GW-EBV were virtually the same as those in Table  when the latter parameterisation of the b was used (result not shown). The computational advantage of our fast algorithm for the BayesB approach to GW-EBV will not outweigh the reduced accuracy observed  if confirmed for typical trait architecture  when used in practical breeding schemes and the computational time and effort can be afforded. If  in practice  breeding schemes wish to select upon GW-EBV that require frequent updating  then a more appropriate comparison is between frequently updated fBayesB estimates of marker effects and the use of 'old' MCMC based estimates of marker effects  where the GW-EBV of animals are calculated without updating the estimates of marker effects  because of computational constraints. In the latter case there will be a loss of accuracy. It will depend on the amount of new information coming into the breeding value evaluation system  which of these alternatives should be favoured. In simulations of breeding schemes and in cross-validation testing of GW-EBV  the large number of EBV evaluations required may make our fast algorithm the only means to implement BayesB type genome-wide breeding value estimation. Here we will analytically derive the integrals in (4) in the main text. The prior () as described in the text is: where () is the Dirac delta function . The Delta function has the property that  if a < 0 < b and 0 otherwise  consequently  if a < c < b and 0 otherwise. The numerator of (4) involves an integration from -8 to +8  which for the first term in (B1) is here split into: The first term in (B2) involves  and the exponent can be re-expressed as: The term  does not involve g and is a constant in the integration  whilst the remaining part    is proportional to a normal density with mean ( – ) and variance . Now collecting terms  the first term of (B2) becomes: The integrand may be recognised as being proportional to the mean of a truncated normal distribution  where the truncation point is 0  and truncated normal distributed has mean ( – ) and variance . The constant of proportionality is the further normalising required for the true truncated density  which is [1 – F(0; ( – )  )]  where F(;   ) is the cumulative normal distribution function with mean  and variance . Calculating the mean of a truncated normal distribution belongs to the standard tools used in animal breeding (involving the standardisation of the distribution and calculating the intensity of selection; . []). For brevity  we define here the function T(;   )  which represents the mean of an upper truncated normal distribution with mean  and variance  truncated at x. After accounting for the scaling the first term of (B2) is seen to be: Using a very similar derivation  the second term of (B2) becomes: where T(;   ) represents the mean of a lower truncated normal distribution with mean  and variance  truncated at x. From (B1) the final term of the numerator of equation () is  which enumerates to 0 following the rules of the Dirac delta-function. The integral in the denominator of equation ()  follows similar arguments to the numerator but there is no g in the integrand so that the integrals now calculate the probability masses associated with the truncated distributions of their means. The term with the Dirac delta function integrates to: After carrying out these calculations and some simplification  and denoting  =  –  and  =  +  the equation () in the main text becomes: The multivariate likelihood of the data    as described by model (1) is: where  means equal up to a proportionality constant; g = the effect of the SNP  and  is a nx1 vector of covariates obtained from the SNP genotyping. We re-express the term ( – gb)'( – )) as: If we use the likelihood (A1) for the estimation of the SNP effect g  than the last two terms in Equation (A2) are constant and thus do not affect the maximisation of the likelihood. Hence  for the estimation of g  (A1) could be expressed as a single-variate density: where  = () and  = () are the sufficient statistics of the data.
