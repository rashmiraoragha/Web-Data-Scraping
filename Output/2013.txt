The inverse of  can be computed from the inverse of the triangular factor () obtained by Cholesky root-free decomposition of .

A recursive computation of  is then achieved with or without information on the sparsity pattern and time required for each computation was recorded. For three numbers of  animals (4000; 8000 and 12 000)   was computed using different pedigree extractions and the closeness of the resulting  to the inverse computed using the fully extracted pedigree was measured by an appropriate norm. The use of prior information on the sparsity of  decreased the computing time for inversion by a factor of 1.73 on average. Computational issues and practical uses of the different algorithms were discussed. Cases involving more than 12 000  animals were considered. Inclusion of 10 generations was determined to be sufficient when computing . Depending on the size and structure of the  sub-population  gains in time to compute  are possible and these gains may increase as the number of  animals increases. Given the sequential nature of most computational steps  the proposed algorithm can benefit from optimization and may be convenient for genomic evaluations. For a population of  animals  the numerator relationship matrix ()  is an -by- matrix with the following properties:   is the numerator relationship coefficient between two animals  and  among   as defined by Wright []; diagonal element   is equal to 1<U+2009>+<U+2009>   where   is the inbreeding coefficient [] of animal ;  is non-singular and symmetric: for two animals  and  among    <U+2009>=<U+2009> . Because the numerator relationship matrix describes the additive similarity between animals  it is an important element explaining genetic (co)variances between animals and has numerous applications in the field of animal genetics  the most important one being its use in setting up the mixed model equations for estimation of breeding values []. In some situations  a particular type of information (genomic information  foreign genetic evaluation  phenotypes on a particular trait  etc.) is only available for some animals  which are selected for this particular purpose  while other animals are excluded. The original population can therefore be split into two sub-populations: a sub-population composed of animals called “ hereafter; a sub-population composed of animals called “ hereafter. Splitting the original population in this way leads to the following partition of : The four blocks include the relationships between  animals ()  between  and  animals ( and ) and between  animals (). Recent methodological developments in animal breeding require inversion of   for example for genotyped animals in the context of genomic prediction using a single-step procedure [–]. Another example concerns external animals when integrating foreign information into a local genetic evaluation []. It is also noteworthy that the pedigree-based relationship matrix  and the genomic relationship matrix (  []) show structural similarities: both matrices express polygenic/genomic similarities among animals inherited from ancestors that are not represented in these matrices. Thus  the present research on  can be extended to genomic relationships in . Based on the original work by Henderson [] on inversion of   a general framework for the inversion of relationship matrices follows (see Appendix 1). Henderson outlined a method that is based on the root-free factorization of  and showed the high sparsity of the inverse triangular factor of . An efficient use of this sparsity then allows direct computation of  as a sum of individual contributions based on a chronological reading of the pedigree. Applying partitioned matrix theory  van Arendonk et al. [] gave a general expression for the sum of individual contributions outlined by Henderson []: an additional row/column in  leads to updating its inverse by increasing the order by 1 and by summing the square of a very sparse vector to . The very sparse vector is the corresponding row (below the diagonal) of the inverse triangular factor. All details on these developments are given in Appendix 1. When required  the inverse of  is currently obtained by brutal inversion algorithms (e.g. generalized inverse algorithm). In these algorithms  any potential sparsity occurring in the matrix to invert or in its inverse is brought out by matrix computations. In contrast  the main objectives of this paper were to investigate how potential sparsity in the inverse triangular factor of  can be characterized using only the pedigree  thus without requiring matrix computations  and then use the sparsity pattern of the inverse triangular factor of  in the computation of its inverse. Whereas the structure of the inverse triangular factor is known for  (positions are given by the pedigree; values are  known)  no information is available on the structure of the inverse triangular factor of   neither on the positions of non-zero elements nor on the values of these elements. Moreover  the inverse triangular factor of  may be close to dense. Therefore  we addressed our objective in the following five steps: inversion of   with an algorithm that uses the inverse triangular factor; development of an algorithm that uses pedigree information to find the positions of the non-zero elements (sparsity pattern) in the inverse triangular factor of  ; inversion of   with the algorithm of step (1) but restricting computations to the non-zero elements identified by the algorithm in step (2); assessment of the time reduction when computing the inverse as in step (3) instead of as in step (1); and evaluation of the effect of the number of generations in the pedigree used to compute    in order to reduce density of the inverse triangular factor. For simplicity  we assume that we are working on the last  animal  indexed as animal . Similarly to inversion of  (see equation .6 in Appendix 1)  assume that  is partitioned in a sub-matrix   of order (-1)  a (-1)-long vector   and a scalar  as: Using blockwise inversion   can be recursively computed using the following equation: where  is a scalar equal to <U+2009>-<U+2009>'. Computing <U+2009>=<U+2009> and defining <U+2009>=<U+2009> simplifies equation () as follows: Similarly  as for  (see Appendix 1)  there is a link between vector  and the root-free Cholesky factorization of  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>')  in that –' corresponds to the last row of the inverse triangular factor of  (). Equation () shows that  can be constructed recursively by adding a vector product to the previous result (). This recursive construction of  will be called “Algorithm A” and implies  from the second row to the last row  the computation of the whole vector . If an animal and its parents are all   vector  is as sparse as in the case of   i.e. the only non-zero elements of  correspond to parents. Restricting computations to these elements  i.e. discarding computations involving elements that we know equal 0  results in saving computing time. Such a case is  however  highly trivial. In the next sections  we propose a method to deal with more complex cases. For animal   vector  is the row of  that spans from column 1 to column (-1). By definition (<U+2009>=<U+2009> thus <U+2009>=<U+2009>)  vector  contains the required coefficients to compute relationships () of animal  with the -1 preceding animals from the relationships between those -1 preceding animals (). In the case of   only known parents of animal  are required to compute its relationships with the preceding animals. Therefore  only positions of known parents have a value different from zero in vector . In the case of   some  animals replace the parents if they are : the value in  of these  animals is different from 0  which means that they are needed to compute relationships between  animals () from the relationships between all  animals (). This can be illustrated by the example pedigree in Figure  and Tables  and   which specify and  for the example pedigree. Three cases are outlined and detailed in the following:  Genealogical tree for a population of 12 animals  partitioned in sub-populations 1 (  circle) and 2 (  square). Alphabetical order gives the birth order. animal  has two known parents   and . Animal  is ; its parent  (grandparent of G) is thus required ( <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>0) to explain the relationship between  and  ( <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25). animal  has one known parent    that is also . Any relationship that  shares with other  animals is necessarily and only explained by  (). animal  has one known parent    that is . Its  halfsib () and the  parent of  (  which is unrelated to ) are required  among others  to explain any relationship that  shares with other  animals. Animals that are required to explain relationships of a given  animal with other  animals will hereafter be denoted as the  of this  animal.  of a  animal can be found by an exhaustive search of  animals that replace any  parent of the  animal. Their determination uses the pedigree and returns which elements of  (and thereby of ) are worth computing because they are expected to be non-zero. By subtraction  we obtain which elements are zeros  which is referred to as the “sparsity pattern” of  in the following. In the next sub-section  we propose a heuristic algorithm that streamlines the determination of the sparsity pattern of . Similar methodologies [  ] have been developed for the triangular factor of a symmetric-positive definite matrix rather than the inverse of the triangular factor. Our proposed heuristic algorithm to set up the sparsity pattern of the inverse triangular factor of  (see pseudo-code below) requires two inputs: the pedigree (of length   renumbered and ordered: parents precede progeny) and the subpopulation to which any animal belongs:  (population status is 1) or  (population status is 2). The purpose of the algorithm is to complete two vectors of variable length for any animal . The first vector () contains references to  parents of animal . The second vector () contains  of animal . The positions of non-zeros in the i-th row in  (sparsity pattern) includes any position of the -th row that is listed in . Initialize a vector  as the integer sequence from 1 to . For any animal  in the whole population ( goes from 1 to )  initialize two vectors   and   as empty vectors if the status of animal  is 2  then append element  to  ; or else if the status of animal  is 1  append element  to   if the sire  of animal  is known and its status is 2  then append element  to  ; or else if  is known but its status is 1  append vector   to   if the dam  of animal  is known and its status is 2  then append element  to  ; or else if  is known but its status is 1  append vector   to   if the status of animal  is 2 and the vector   is not empty  then:or else if the status of animal  is 1 or if the vector   is empty  do nothing. Select all elements of  that are at positions given in    remove duplicates and gather them in a temporary list  for any element  in list   Append to   the elements of vector   not yet in   Select elements of  that are equal to  and replace them by i; If the whole population was  (i.e. <U+2009>=<U+2009>  every animal has status 2)  it can be easily deduced from the algorithm that only the animal itself (in step (1)) and its known sire and dam (in steps (2) and (3)) would enter vector . The corresponding  would be highly sparse  as it is for . This also means that if numerous parents are   then this algorithm is expected to run very fast. An example of the use of this algorithm is given in the Results section. The algorithm for blockwise inversion of  (Algorithm A  summarized in equation ()) is modified to account for sparsity and will be called Algorithm B. For simplicity  we still consider the last  animal (animal ). Algorithm B reduces computations to obtain  from <U+2009>=<U+2009> (equations 2 and 3) by three procedures  depending on the number () of elements in the corresponding vector  and the length of  (-1). The first procedure (called ) is used when <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 ( is empty). If so  only  is added to element . The value of  is just the inverse of . The second procedure (called   for matrix PRODuct) is used when  is smaller than but relatively close to (-1). In such a case  we perform a line-wise partition (equation ()) of  and  between non-zeros (of subscript ) and null (subscript ) entries of  in order to avoid useless computations: Since (-1) is the number of elements in  and  the number of elements in    dot products (of (-1)-long vectors) would be performed instead of (-1) dot products (of (-1)-long vectors). The third procedure (called   for Linear System of lower size) is used when  is much smaller than (-1). In such a case  we extend the previous partition of  to a blockwise partition of  and  (the non-zero and zero elements of  are respectively indexed by  and ): Then  applying partitioned matrix theory to equation () returns the following expressions for  and  (with ): Vector  can be expressed in terms of  () and  since  is a vector of zeros  it comes that computing  shrinks to compute only . In other words  the linear system <U+2009>=<U+2009> is replaced by a linear system of lower size <U+2009>=<U+2009>  and solving it is valuable only if the number of operations required to solve it is lower than the number of operations to achieve the product in procedure . We chose the less expensive procedure ( or ) by estimation of the number of expected floating-point multiplications. In order to evaluate Algorithm B in comparison with regular inversion (Algorithm A)  different  were computed on the basis of a real pedigree provided by the Luxembourg breeders society CONVIS. This pedigree includes dairy cows from Luxembourg with their ancestors tracing back up to 24 generations and contains 387 499 animals. Statistics of the pedigree data are Table .  sub-populations of three sizes (4000  8000 and 12 000 animals) were designed and are identified hereafter as the three size scenarios S4k  S8k and S12k. Animals of the selected sub-populations were randomly chosen from a pool of animals born after 1999 (128 465 animals) on the assumption that only recent animals could be of interest (those being genotyped or in production). Because a pedigree with a lower number of extracted generations is expected to provide a sparser   the impact of the number of extracted generations was also evaluated for each size scenario. This enabled us to assess how many extracted generations were required in the pedigree to compute a  that is a sufficient approximation to the  computed using all available ancestors in the pedigree  which will be referred to as the “real inverse”. Extracting no animals other than  animals refers to “generation 0”: the population is only made of  animals. When extracting one generation of ancestors (“generation 1”)   parents enter the population. When extracting two generations of ancestors (“generation 2”)   grandparents also enter the population  and so on. Details on the number of animals extracted and the percentage of extraction after each generation  considered as the ratio between the number of animals in the population and the maximum number of animals available in the pedigree  are outlined in Figure .  Generation by generation extraction of the pedigree of the  population for three size scenarios (green: S4k; orange: S8k; blue: S12k): number of extracted animals (¦) and proportion of  animals in the extracted population ()  expressed as a percentage. Extraction went up to 23 generations for scenario S4k and up to 24 generations for scenarios S8k and S12k. Deviations from the real inverse were measured by the following norm:   where  is the inverse of  computed using  extracted generations and  is the real inverse. This norm can be interpreted as the average difference between the value of any element of  and its corresponding value in . The two matrices are equal when  is equal to 0. Matrix  was computed in two steps. Inbreeding coefficients were first computed for each size scenario and number of extracted generations. The average inbreeding coefficient was never greater than 1.23 % and the greatest inbreeding coefficient was 44.53%. Matrix  was then computed using the method of Colleau []. In order to evaluate potential gains in time when using Algorithm B instead of Algorithm A to invert   we developed two test programs in Fortran 95. The programs were neither optimized for speed  nor parallelized. Therefore  all comparisons have to be interpreted as relative figures. The first program applies the recursive construction of the inverse  as outlined in Algorithm A (equations () and ()). Potential null entries in  are checked to avoid useless computations when performing product . The second program restricts the same recursive construction of the inverse to non-zero elements by procedures    and . Potential null entries in  are also taken into account when performing the product  (procedure ). The linear system <U+2009>=<U+2009> (procedure ) is solved by factorization and by backward and forward substitutions. For both programs  computing time was recorded using Fortran intrinsic subroutine CPU_TIME. For the program that uses Algorithm B  computing time includes the time required to determine the sparsity pattern. All computations and file storage were performed using double precision (15 digits). Each job was repeated 20 times on an Intel Xeon 64-bit processor (RAM: 8 Gb  cache size: 6 Mb  clock speed: 3 GHz). The algorithm to characterize the sparsity pattern was applied to the example pedigree of Figure  and specified in Table  (including animal status). The algorithm starts by initializing a vector  equal to [1 <U+2009>2 <U+2009>3 <U+2009>4 <U+2009>5 <U+2009>6 <U+2009>7 <U+2009>8 <U+2009>9 <U+2009>10 <U+2009>11 <U+2009>12]. Then  we consecutively treat each animal depending on its status and the status of its parents. Population status of the animal is given in a 4th column: 1 for   2 for . Animal 1. Status 1 and unknown parents. Thus  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[1]  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[-] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>. Animal 2. Status 1 and unknown parents. Thus  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[2]  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[-] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>. Animal 3. Status 2 and known parents (1 and 2; both status 1). Thus  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[3] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>[1 <U+2009>2]. The list of elements of  that match  is [  ]. Then  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[3 <U+2009> <U+2009>]<U+2009>=<U+2009>[3] and any element of  equal to 1 or 2 is replaced by 3  returning <U+2009>=<U+2009>[3 <U+2009>3 <U+2009>3 <U+2009>4 <U+2009>5 <U+2009>6 <U+2009>7 <U+2009>8 <U+2009>9 <U+2009>10 <U+2009>11 <U+2009>12].

Thus  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[3] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>[5 <U+2009>]<U+2009>=<U+2009>[5 <U+2009>4]. No list to set up because animal has status 1; <U+2009>=<U+2009>. Animal 6. Status 2 and unknown parents.

The elapsed CPU time results (averaged over 20 repetitions) are shown in Figure . Taking sparsity into account (Algorithm B) instead of using an inversion algorithm with cubic complexity (Algorithm A) reduced the elapsed CPU time for computing the inverse. For instance  the relative gains in computing speed of Algorithm B for the fully extracted pedigree were 1.67 faster for S4k  1.75 faster for S8k  and 1.77 faster for S12k.  Elapsed CPU time required for inversion of  of three different sizes (green: 4000; orange: 8000; blue: 12000)  computed using pedigrees with different numbers of extracted generations  by algorithms B (¦) and A (). Red lines show upper and lower confidence intervals (99%; 20 repetitions). For each size scenario   was computed using different numbers of extracted generations and the inverses were compared (Figure ) to  computed using the fully extracted pedigree (after 23  24 and 24 generations respectively for scenarios S4k  S8k and S12k) by computing the norm . As shown in Figure   regardless of the size of the matrix  the norm stabilized after 14 generations to values less than 1E-13  which can be attributed to errors due to precision.  Differences  as base-10 logarithm of the norm   between  based on a pedigree with a limited number of extracted generations and  based on a fully extracted pedigree  for three size scenarios (green: S4k; orange: S8k; blue: S12k). Figure  shows the elapsed CPU time (averaged over 20 repetitions) when running the proposed algorithm to determine the sparsity pattern of  on populations with different numbers of  animals (4000; 8000; 12 000) and that were extracted from several generations. The curves of the three size scenarios (S4k  S8k and S12k) presented a similar behavior. When the population consists only of  animals (generation 0)  the elapsed time was less than 1 second (S4k: 0.03 s  S8k: 0.11 s and S12k: 0.29 s). For this case  only non-zero entries occur for  sires or dams of  animals   present in the pedigree. Then  elapsed CPU time increased linearly up to the 15th extracted generation  although at a different rate for the different size scenarios. Beyond that point  adding ancestors did not affect the elapsed time. These results have to be related with pedigree extraction (Figure ): does it make sense to spend more time for additional generations? Almost all available ancestors have entered the population after extracting 10 generations (between 95-99% of the number of animals in the last extraction round). However  elapsed CPU time continued to increase at the same rate from generations 10 to 15. For instance  in scenario S12k  adding ~3% of the final population cost an additional ~4 seconds (or ~22% of the total elapsed time). The usefulness of this small group of remote ancestors for inversion of  is discussed hereafter (sub-section “”).  Elapsed CPU time required by the proposed algorithm for determination of the sparsity pattern of   by number of extracted generations  for three size scenarios (green: S4k  orange: S8k and blue: S12k). Red lines show upper and lower confidence intervals (99%; 20 repetitions). For the fully extracted population (after 23  24 and 24 generations for scenarios S4k  S8k and S12k  respectively)  there was a close-to-linear relationship between the size of the  population and the elapsed CPU time (approximately 6 seconds for 4000 additional animals in the  sub-population). The effective computational complexity of this algorithm is difficult to establish  however  because it mostly depends  first  on how the population was split (for instance  a  sub-population that includes mainly a few lines or families would not contain that many  parents) and  secondly  on how the population is structured (depth of the pedigree  effective size of the population  average inbreeding). The embedded loop in the algorithm (step (4b) in the pseudo-code) is the main computational bottleneck and performs  iterations. In a population of  animals  if  is related to the two factors mentioned above (i.e. splitting and structure of the population)  then the computing time required by the algorithm would behave as <U+2009>·<U+2009>  where  would be a case-specific factor. This agrees with the observations in Figure . For a population of  animals with  animals  vectors  and  have the greatest RAM requirements. In our implementation  vector  stores few elements (positions of  ancestors) for all animals (thus<U+2009>~<U+2009> integers). For  animals  vector  stores non-zero positions and includes approximately  integers  where  is the average density of  (number of non-zeros in the lower part of  averaged by line). For  animals   accounts for potential  ancestors  therefore including approximately  integers  where  is the average number of  ancestors per  animal. Memory would thus be allocated for approximately  integers. None of these integers may be declared as 3-byte integers when  is lower than 2 (i.e. when pedigree contains less than 16.77 millions of animals). If additional animals are   then the proportion of  animals in the population would likely increase. In fact these additional animals would either bring new  ancestors (case 1)  share ancestors with already  animals (case 2)  or have no registered parents in the pedigree (case 3). The two last cases are expected to be more important as the number of  animals increases. Therefore  matrix  of such a population should get sparser. These expectations were confirmed by randomly picking animals from the pool of 128 465 animals born after 1999  simulating eight larger  sub-populations of 16 000 up to 128 000 animals. Table  gives sizes and proportions of the  sub-populations. Using a computer with higher memory resources (64 Gb of RAM)  the sparsity pattern of these new situations was computed. Then  the degree of sparsity was assessed as the percentage of null entries in the lower triangular part of  for these new situations  as well as for previous size scenarios. The results in Figure  show that the degree of sparsity remained the same for low percentages of  animals in the population (lower than 20%)  while the degree of sparsity increased linearly beyond approximately 20 k animals in these specific cases. The average degree of sparsity by number of  animals corresponded to the average number of  for a given animal in a given size situation. Figure  shows that the average number of  was linearly related to the number of  animals up to ~80 k  animals  beyond which the average number of  was constant. We expected the average number of contributors to decrease as the number of  animals increased. These new  animals would then cover more of the relationships due to  animals. Note that the average number of contributors would be less than 2 if all animals were  (i.e. <U+2009>=<U+2009>).  Proportion of null entries in the lower triangular part of  for different proportions (%) and numbers (thousands of animals) of  animals in an extracted population.    Average number of  by line of   for different numbers of  animals (in thousands of animals). When running Algorithm B  the procedure (   or ) to compute vector  was chosen according to the estimated number of floating-point multiplications to be performed. A view of this choice along all (-1) lines of  is given in Figure  for each size scenario ( was always computed using a fully extracted pedigree). Due to prior reordering of the pedigree by generation  the first lines of  correspond to founders (unrelated animals) and are thus empty. Procedure  occurred less than procedures  and  but was evenly distributed among line numbers  particularly for scenario S12k.  Procedure choice (green: ; yellow: ; blue: ) when running algorithm B  along all line numbers of   for inversion of matrix  with a fully extracted pedigree  for three size scenarios [: S4k; : S8k ; : S12k]. Considering Algorithm B led to estimation of the computational complexities based on the expected number of floating-point multiplications involved in the different tasks achieved by Algorithm B  as specified in Table . Total complexity is detailed for treatment of one line and for treatment of one full matrix of order  in Table   where treatment refers to all tasks to be performed  i.e. computing  and adding ' to the previous inverse. If  (average number of ) is considered as independent of   the most complex term is (<U+2009>·<U+2009>)  which is required when using the  procedure (proportion  of the total). The  procedure is used less frequently for greater matrices (see Figures  and  beyond 80 k animals). Treating  as independent of  is also a more reasonable assumption for greater matrices (Figure )  since  is undoubtedly related to  for smaller matrices. The total complexity for a matrix of order  becomes: where  represents the average density of the matrix. The most complex term  is tempered by two very low coefficients: the proportion of times the  procedure is used ()  which may be very low for small matrices (Figure )  and the cube of the average density   which was lower than 0.5 in our examples (Figure ) for matrices of order beyond 32 000. Thus  Algorithm B seems more suitable for large matrices than for small matrices  regardless of whether there is dependence between  and  or not.  Proportional (%) use of the three procedures in algorithm B (green: ; yellow: ; blue: )  for different numbers of  animals (in thousands of animals). The issue of numerical stability was also addressed. When using procedure   the result of the previous iteration was used in the current iteration through  and . Accumulating errors could lead to instabilities and/or divergences. However  in  procedure the result of the previous iteration does not affect the  that is computed. Choosing the  procedure at regular intervals among iterations using the  procedure (see Figure ) stops the accumulation of errors that could have resulted from continuously choosing the  procedure. Therefore  interlacing choices for both procedures is a good way to prevent numerical instability. Independence between iterations also allows procedure  to parallelized. Algorithm B requires allocation of more than twice the RAM than Algorithm A because it cannot store the results of the inversion in the input matrix. This is due to procedure  working on different parts of . However  since elements that are required for  are identified when determining the sparsity pattern  they could be stored separately in order to reduce the amount of RAM required. For that reason  sparsity patterns should be established prior to computation of  to determine which relationships are worth being computed. The depth of the pedigree to be used for instance in genetic evaluations  is still a question of debate  and often moderately deep pedigrees are used  especially when only recent data is analyzed. Results in Figure  suggest that pedigree from a limited number of generations (5 to 10) is sufficient to compute  with reasonable accuracy. The explanation is that distant ancestors do not greatly enhance a relationship. For instance  a common ancestor to animals  and  that enters the pedigree after  extracted generations and that is older than any selected animal  can only add up to 2 to the value of the relationship between  and . In generation  and  can have a maximum of 2 common ancestors Therefore  extracting an additional generation can increase the relationship between  and  by only up to <U+2009>=<U+2009>2. Regardless of the number of animals added to the pedigree when extracting generation 10  the maximum change brought to any relationship reduces to less than 0.001  which would have a minor effect on the inverse scale  as confirmed by Figure . However  computing time required for determination of the sparsity pattern increases linearly after 10 generations (Figure ). Thus  limiting extraction of pedigree to 10 generations appears to be a good balance between taking into account relationships due to distant ancestors and computing time. Applying a similar study to pedigree extractions for routine genetic evaluations would be meaningful and may lead us to consider extracting a number of generations instead of a birth year limit  which is current common practice. For genomic evaluations  two specific situations where  is needed may require the use of Algorithm B. First  as explained above and shown in equation ()  the inverse of the matrix is computed recursively by adding a block specific to the current animal to the previous inverse. At each genomic evaluation   could therefore be stored in a file and reused at the next evaluation cycle. At each evaluation  the matrix would be enhanced by adding newly genotyped animals. However  this approach has some limits: Animals have to be listed by generation order and only animals younger than those already genotyped can be added because older animals may cause changes in the sparsity pattern. This could be easily implemented in a cattle breed such as Holstein  where only few animals are key ancestors of the breed. The resulting file may be large but this could be reduced by sparse storage approaches. Meyer et al. [] recently applied a similar methodology for computation of the inverse of the genomic relationship matrix (): their methodology also updates the previous inverse of   necessitating its storage on disk from an evaluation to the next one. Secondly  when using a pedigree of only one extracted generation  which contains genotyped animals and their ungenotyped parents  inversion of  is even faster (Figure ) and the inverse seems to be a reasonable approximation of  computed with a full extracted pedigree (see Figure  and Discussion here above). Such a fair approximation of  may be useful as a preconditioner to solve <U+2009>=<U+2009>  for instance  as required in the iterative solution of MME of single-step genomic BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) proposed by Legarra and Ducrocq []. The algorithm to determine the sparsity pattern of the inverse triangular factor of  is obviously useful only in inversion algorithms that use the inverse triangular factor. For other inversion algorithms  the algorithm to determine the sparsity pattern should not be useful. Inversion algorithms that use the inverse triangular factor are useful in certain cases (e.g.  for updating an inverted matrix or for obtaining quick approximations)  but they would be less efficient  in terms of computing time  for the single purpose of inversion. The time required by Algorithms A and B was compared with the time required by subroutine “dkmxhf.f90” (K. Meyer  University of New England  Australia)  which is a regular and efficient inversion algorithm. For inversion of the three different orders of  (4000  8000 and 12 000)  computing times of dkmxhf.f90 were lower than computing times obtained with Algorithm A and similar to those obtained with Algorithm B (accounting for sparsity). For small numbers of extracted generations  computing times were slightly lower for Algorithm B than dkmxhf.f90  but were greater when greater numbers of generations were extracted. However  the computing speed of Algorithm B can benefit from several optimizations (e.g.  parallelization of the  procedure and use of specific libraries for matrix products). For computational ease  a small population (less than 1 million animals) was used in this study. Gains in computing time have to be tested for other sizes of population. This study was also restricted to only one population by size scenario and used repetitions (20) of the algorithm on the same data. Use of a Holstein population may also be criticized because although the average computed inbreeding was never greater than 1.23%  such a population has few key ancestors. Having the key ancestors in the  sub-population might avoid density  because they would be  of many other  animals. The determination of the sparsity pattern of  using pedigree information is a prior step that allows gains in computing time for inversion based on the use of . This allowed the computing time for inversion of matrices of three different sizes (4000  8000 and 12 000  animals) to be reduced by a factor 1.73 on average. Gains in computing time are expected to be higher if the number of  animals exceeds 80 000. Memory requirements for inversion of such a matrix would increase and the algorithm would become numerically more stable  since the  procedure would become more important than the  procedure. Moreover  computation of the inverse by a recursive method may be very helpful in the case of genomic prediction  where a new batch of younger  animals at each upcoming evaluation must be added to the previous inverse matrix already computed. The results on the number of pedigree generations required for the  animals suggest that no more than 14 generations should be extracted. If the working precision is less than 15 digits  this can even be reduced. A good balance between computing time for determination of the sparsity pattern and accuracy may be achieved with 10 extracted generations. The numerator relationship matrix () can be factorized as Henderson [] proposed a recursion rule to compute the triangular factor : In equation (.2)   and  are two matrices of respective sizes (-1) and . They refer  computed after  respectively  (-1) and  recursions. Vector  is a vector of parental contributions: it summarizes the linear dependency between parents and offspring. This vector is null except on positions corresponding to parents of  where it is equal to 0.5. Henderson [] also showed that the inverse triangular factor () only contains three different values: 0  1and -0.5  since it is obtained by triangular matrix inversion (equation 1.3). The elements of the diagonal are equal to 1 and the lower off-diagonal elements are equal to the vector  corresponding to the  animal; they contain thus only 0 and -0.5 elements. Besides   the diagonal matrix  is computed one element at a time according to Henderson [] and Quaas []. At the  recursion  has the form: Replacing equations (.2) and (1.4) in (1.1) shows that the recursion rule for computation of  is actually identical to that of the tabular method (equation 1.5.3  Emik and Terril []; Henderson [])  since it computes the last below-diagonal row in  as a linear combination of rows in . Replacing  in equation (.5.3) by  (the equivalence can be easily shown) expresses the tabular method as in van Arendonk et al. []: Applying the partitioned matrix theory to equation (.6)  van Arendonk et al. [] structured  as a sum of  updates of a null matrix (recursion rule in equation .7) involving multiplication of a sparse vector (-) by itself. The sparse vector - is actually the transpose of the -th below-diagonal row of  (see equation .3). Such a construction of  requires thus to know the following: the positions and values of non-zero elements in    i.e. the structure of  ; some elements of the original matrix  to compute   as . After meeting these requirements (determination of the structure of the inverse triangular factor and computation of some elements of the original matrix)  the same framework was extended to the inversion of other relationship matrices used in animal breeding (e.g. gametic relationship matrix []  dominance [] and epistasis [] effects or covariance matrix of marked QTL effects []).

Genomic estimated breeding values were more accurate and showed more within-family variation  which led to higher genetic gains for the same restriction on inbreeding. Using genomic relationships to restrict inbreeding provided no additional gain  except in the case of very large full-sib families. Selection of livestock has led to increases in inbreeding over time  especially following the widespread use of artificial insemination and reproductive technologies. Inbreeding reduces the total number of heterozygotes in the population  hence reducing variation  which can cause a depression in fitness (inbreeding depression) and a decrease in selection response []. Selection on pedigree-based BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) EBV (estimated breeding values) can lead to increases in inbreeding because the covariance between EBV of family members may be high  especially when animals are selected at a young age using EBV that are based on ancestral information. Estimation of breeding values based on DNA marker information is now used in many livestock breeding programs []. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) are usually equal to or more accurate than EBV based on parent average information (PA_EBV). Furthermore  it has been suggested that GEBV could also be used as a tool to reduce inbreeding because they may explain more Mendelian sampling variation than PA_EBV []. Thus  selection on GEBV is expected to increase genetic gain while maintaining the population’s diversity. However  the question of what proportion of the Mendelian sampling variance is explained by GEBV and whether GEBV can be used to manage inbreeding remains unanswered. Various methods have been developed to manage inbreeding in livestock breeding populations and all focus on managing inbreeding while increasing genetic gain [–]. To attempt to control inbreeding and maximize response to selection  Wray and Goddard [] proposed a dynamic selection principle  which places a penalty on the co-ancestry of the selected animals. Meuwissen [] extended this principle to introduce optimum contribution selection so that inbreeding could be limited to a specific level and the rate of gain maximized for that specific level of inbreeding. These optimal selection principles have been shown to maximize genetic gain at lower rates of inbreeding so that response can be maintained in the long term. The addition of genomic information to optimal contribution selection can have several impacts on the genetic gain achieved in a breeding program. First  EBV based on genomic information are generally more accurate than PA_EBV [] and allow for more accurate selection to occur at a younger age. Secondly  GEBV may explain more within family variation  which would allow for increases in genetic merit at the same level of inbreeding []. Finally  increases in genetic gain may be possible if genomic instead of pedigree relationships are used to restrict inbreeding []. Unlike the expected relationships derived from pedigree  genomic relationships can vary for a given type of relative []  which may enable different selection decisions to be made. For example  it may be undesirable to select two sires from the same family; however  by using genomic relationships to constrain inbreeding it may be possible to include siblings that are less related to each other in the breeding program. The aims of this study were to test the effect of genomic information on the balance between genetic gain and inbreeding under optimal selection and to observe how much GEBV vary within a family in real data. Genotype simulations were conducted using the Markovian Coalescence Simulator (MaCS) [] to simulate 2000 base haplotypes  with an effective population size () of 1000. As described in Clark et al. []  30 chromosomes each with base haplotypes of 100 cM (1.10 base pairs) were simulated with a mutation rate of 2.5.10 per site. The total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating on the genome was approximately 1 670 000. Sixty thousand SNP markers and 6000 QTL were randomly selected from the SNP sequence for genomic analysis. Therefore  each SNP had a 3% chance of being used as a marker and a 0.03% chance of being used as a QTL. As in Meuwissen et al. []  the additive effect of each QTL was drawn from a gamma distribution with shape parameter 0.4 and scale parameter 1.66  and had a 50% chance of being positive or negative. The base haplotypes were randomly allocated to 500 male and 500 female base animals of a simulated population structure. Two subsequent generations received haplotypes via Mendelian inheritance  allowing recombination to occur according to genetic distance  i.e. 1% recombination per cM. Each generation in the simulated population contained 1000 animals (50% males and 50% females). Twenty males were randomly selected in each generation and each male was randomly mated to 25 females. Each female had two offspring per generation (half-sib population). A second population was simulated with a full-sib family structure (full-sib population). This population included 25 males  each mated to two females and all females had 20 offspring each. All animals in each simulation were allocated breeding values and phenotypes. True breeding values (TBV) for each animal were determined using: where  is the additive effect of QTL () and  is the QTL genotype at locus  which was coded as 0  1  or 2  as the number of copies of a given QTL allele that an individual () carries. Trait phenotypes were simulated by adding a random environmental effect drawn from a normal distribution with variance   which was chosen to result in a heritability () of 0.3. Selection of animals in the third generation was investigated. Phenotypes and SNP genotypes of the two previous generations of animals were used as the reference population (2000 animals). The selection candidates had no phenotypic records and their breeding values were estimated by BLUP  using either pedigree (PA_EBV) or genomic information (GEBV). As in Hayes et al. []  we assumed the following model for genetic evaluation: where  is a vector of phenotypes   is the mean   is a vector of 1 s   is a design matrix allocating records to breeding values   is a vector of breeding values for animals in the reference set and the test set  and  is a vector of normal deviates with variance . For genomic BLUP (gBLUP)  V() =  where  is the genomic relationship matrix  and  is the genetic variance for this model. Matrix  was formed using the method described by VanRaden []. Pedigree-based BLUP was also used to analyse the data. Pedigree-based BLUP uses the same model as gBLUP  except that V() =  s where  is the numerator relationship matrix based on pedigree and s is the additive genetic variance. Variance components for both models were estimated with ASREML [] and the model solutions yielded EBV. The accuracy of the EBV was estimated as the correlation between TBV and EBV (GEBV or PA_EBV) for the selection candidates. The intra-class correlation between EBV of animals from different family structures (half- or full-sib families) was also estimated based on the selection candidates. Optimal contribution selection was undertaken to maximize the expected genetic value of future offspring while maintaining different levels of genetic diversity (i.e. effectively allowing for different rates of inbreeding). The average genetic merit of the selected individuals (m) was maximized using the dynamic selection rule of Wray and Goddard []; m =  '  where  is a vector that relates to how much each selection candidate contributes to the next generation and  is a vector of EBV  using either genomic (GEBV)  pedigree (PA_EBV) or true (TBV) breeding values. Rates of inbreeding were restricted by penalizing the average co-ancestry of the selection candidates to; c = <U+03BB>  '  where  is the (n x n) relationship matrix among the selection candidates based on pedigree and <U+03BB> is the penalty factor applied to restrict inbreeding. Note that the level of inbreeding equals  ' / 2. Table  shows the alternative levels of <U+03BB> that were used to obtain a graph of possible solutions for maximum genetic gain for the various levels of co-ancestry. Solutions for m + c were obtained using an evolutionary algorithm [] such that an optimal  was determined. To evaluate the impact of restricting inbreeding using genomic relationships rather than pedigree relationships   was substituted by . The overall increase in genetic merit was measured as the increase in TBV and inbreeding was assessed based on the average genomic co-ancestry among selected individuals such that results from the alternate selection strategies were compared on an equal basis. Estimated breeding values and 50 k genotypes were obtained for 267 bulls from the Australian Dairy Holstein Improvement Scheme (ADHIS) and 140 bulls from the Livestock Improvement Corporation (LIC) in NZ. These EBV were for the 2007 cohort of Holstein bulls that obtained progeny test proofs in 2011. Breeding values (GEBV  PA_EBV and PT_EBV) for milk  fat and protein yield were obtained from each organization. The average number of daughter records per sire was 90. Each dataset consisted primarily of a half-sib family structure but 30 bulls from the ADHIS dataset and 28 bulls from the LIC dataset shared one full sibling and the ADHIS dataset contained two families of four full siblings. The 50 k genotypes were used to form  to use in optimal contribution selection (as above). Note that PA_EBV were based on information before the bulls had progeny themselves and the GEBV were based on genomic information alone. Optimal contribution selection was performed (as above) for each dairy dataset  with the rate of inbreeding restricted by penalizing the average co-ancestry of the selection candidates using pedigree information () or genomic information (). Genetic merit was maximized using either GEBV or PA_EBV. The overall genetic gain was measured as the increase in PT_EBV since it was the most accurate estimate of TBV and inbreeding was assessed based on the average genomic co-ancestry. To explore the within-family variation in EBV  the effects of sire and dam were fitted as random effects in an analysis of PA_EBV  GEBV and PT_EBV using ASReml []. In the analysis of EBV  the effects of sire and dam remove variation between families and the unexplained variation is the within-family variation in EBV. For PA_EBV  the residual variation (e) that remains is expected to be zero. Using GEBV as an estimate of genetic merit generally gave higher genetic gains than selection based on PA_EBV (Figure ). In the simulation  average accuracies of GEBV and PA_EBV were 0.57 and 0.45  respectively. For the population that consisted of large half-sib families  there was no difference in genetic gain when using pedigree or genomic measures of relationship to constrain inbreeding (Figure ). However  more sires and dams were consistently selected when inbreeding was constrained using genomic relationships.                                                                                                           For the population that consisted of large full-sib families and when selection was on GEBV  the use of genomic relationships to constrain inbreeding resulted in greater genetic gain than the use of pedigree relationships (Figure ). In contrast  when selection was on PA_EBV  no differences could be observed between constraining inbreeding based on pedigree or genomic information. With high and moderate constraints on co-ancestry  higher genetic gains were obtained when using genomic relationships than with pedigree-based relationships. When pedigree relationships were used to constrain inbreeding  all animals in a full-sib family were considered equal with regard to co-ancestry. However  when genomic information was used  the breeding program could be optimized by selecting a high performing full-sib with lower co-ancestry with other selected individuals. With a low or no constraint on inbreeding  both measures of relationship resulted in the same genetic gain and each method selected the single best sire and dam for all matings.                                                      Table  shows the intra-class correlations between breeding values (PA_EBV or GEBV) for half-sibs and full-sibs in the two simulated populations. In the half-sib families the correlations between the EBV of family members were similar for GEBV and PA_EBV. In the full sib population  there was a lower correlation between the GEBV of family members than that of PA_EBV. Genomic breeding values for bulls in the ADHIS data set were more accurate than PA_EBV  which led to higher gains in merit when using GEBV as a measure of merit in optimal contribution selection (Figure ). Reducing the number of sires by increasing the constraint on inbreeding had little impact when selection was based on PA_EBV. In the LIC dataset  optimal selection based on GEBV and PA_EBV gave variable results  with no clear difference in genetic gain between the two measures of merit  except at high inbreeding levels  for which PA_EBV often outperformed GEBV (Figure ).                                                                                                           The use of genomic or pedigree-based relationships to restrict inbreeding resulted in similar genetic gains. However  the use of genomic relationships (compared to using pedigree relationships) increased the number of animals selected  although differences in merit (based on PT_BV) and average inbreeding were small or null for all traits measured  especially for the LIC dataset (Figure ). At low and moderate inbreeding levels  genetic gains were slightly higher for the ADHIS dataset (Figure ) when using genomic relationships to constrain inbreeding.                                                                                                           Table  shows the proportion of variation that was attributed to the various sources for each EBV for the two dairy datasets. As expected  sire and dam (between-family) explained most of the variation in PA_EBV. In contrast  within-family differences explained 30 to 40% of the variation in GEBV  with the rest due to sire and dam. Approximately half of the variation in PT_BV was due to sire and dam and half was due to within-family differences. Genomic breeding values provided greater genetic gains than PA_EBV for the same rate of inbreeding. Using simulation  Nielsen et al. [] previously reported optimal contribution selection on GEBV to increase gains by up to 80%  but in our study increases were much lower  i.e. 16%. Genetic gains with optimal contribution selection on GEBV are greatly affected by the structure of the selected population. In highly related full-sib families (Figure  and as simulated by Nielsen et al. [] and Sonesson et al. [])  there is some variation in GEBV within families (intra-class correlation of 0.85 (Table ))  which can be used in optimal contribution selection  i.e. a full-sib with a higher GEBV can be selected. In contrast  PA_EBV have an intra-class correlation of 1  with all full-sibs receiving the same EBV and therefore no within-family variation can be exploited. In a population of large half-sib families  there is already some differentiation of animals based on PA_EBV (intra-class correlation of 0.55). However the intra-class correlation for GEBV is lower (0.5) than that for PA_EBV and may allow for extra gain when selecting animals based on GEBV under constrained inbreeding. Additional increases in merit due to selection on GEBV are because GEBV are more accurate than PA_EBV. Avendano et al. [] suggested that the success of optimal breeding schemes depends on how much Mendelian sampling effects (within family) contribute to variation in EBV. In our study  one third of the variation in GEBV was within-families  hence supporting the suggestions of Daetwyler et al. [] that GEBV explain more Mendelian sampling effects than PA_EBV. However  PT_EBV explained more within-family variation than GEBV  with GEBV explaining 36 to 56% of the within-family variance in PT_EBV. Given this  the Mendelian sampling variance explained by the GEBV is comparable to that of a small progeny test. A large proportion of variation in GEBV was explained by the sire and dam effects (between family)  demonstrating that information on close relatives contributes to GEBV [–]. Sonesson et al. [] noted that in optimal contribution selection  the relationship structure used to constrain inbreeding must be the same as that used to estimate breeding values in order to maximize genetic gain. This is especially important if inbreeding is constrained to a specific level because pedigree and genomic measures of inbreeding are often on different scales []. However  an alternative approach to balancing inbreeding and genetic gain is to vary the inbreeding penalty (<U+03BB>) and graph a range of outcomes for inbreeding (co-ancestry) and genetic gain. Such a graph provides alternative solutions to the breeder  who then can balance how much merit (s)he is prepared to sacrifice to maintain diversity. Using this approach  various methods and strategies can be compared on a fair basis  as long as the scale along both axes is consistent across alternatives. In other words  either pedigree or genomic measures of relationship can be used to compare outcomes on the co-ancestry axis  as long as the same measure is used across alternatives. Similar to the study by Schierenbeck et al. []  we found that in the real data example  there was again no difference in genetic gain due to constraints based on genomic relationships or pedigree relationships. This supports the results from the simulation study and shows that in the two dairy cattle datasets  which had clear large half-sib population structures  there was little or no advantage to using genomic relationship information to manage inbreeding. However  the results from our simulation study suggest that for a breeding population with a larger full-sib family structure  the advantage of using genomic relationships to manage inbreeding may be quite substantial  especially at low and moderate inbreeding levels. To achieve low inbreeding levels in a population that consists of many full-sib families  it will be necessary to select one animal from each family. When selection aims at increasing genetic gain  more than one animal per family may be needed. The within-family variation in GEBV makes it possible to use some within-family selection differential and the variation in relationship can allow for increases in genetic merit without compromising genetic diversity. This also occurs in populations that have a half-sib family structure but the additional variation in relationship that can be exploited is lower since variation in pedigree relationships and PA_EBV already exits. As in Pryce et al. []  we observed that at low inbreeding levels the use of genomic measures to manage inbreeding also led to an increase in the number of sires  in both the simulated and dairy bull dataset  however  this had little to no impact on inbreeding levels in the population. The amount of variation in EBV among family members may be important to determine how much gain can be obtained from using genomic relationships to manage inbreeding. Furthermore  within families  a positive correlation between GEBV and the genomic relationship may exist with the best selection candidate  which reduces the prospects for genomic relationships to create additional selection opportunities without reducing genetic gain. Genomic information can be used in livestock breeding programs to optimize genetic gain and inbreeding. Selection on GEBV increases genetic gain for a given rate of inbreeding because GEBV are more accurate and display more within-family variation than PA_EBV. Using genomic rather than pedigree-based relationships had limited impact on achieving additional genetic gain for a given rate of inbreeding in populations that consisted mainly of half-sib families (such as in dairy cattle)  because the intra-class correlations among the EBV of relatives were already relatively low. However when the population consisted of large full-sib families  there was a clear benefit from using genomic relationships to control inbreeding  especially at moderate and low inbreeding constraints.

However  the phase of LD between a SNP and a QTL may differ between  and  because they diverged at least one hundred thousand years ago. Here  we test the hypothesis that the apparent effect of a SNP on a quantitative trait depends on whether the SNP allele is inherited from a  or  ancestor.MethodsPhenotype data on one or more traits and SNP genotype data for 10 181 cattle from    and composite breeds were used. All animals had genotypes for 729 068 SNPs (real or imputed). Chromosome segments were classified as originating from  or  on the basis of the haplotype of SNP alleles they contained. Consequently  SNP alleles were classified according to their sub-species origin. Three models were used for the association study: (1) conventional GWAS (genome-wide association study)  fitting a single SNP effect regardless of subspecies origin  (2) interaction GWAS  fitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies-origin  and (3) best variable GWAS  fitting the most significant combination of SNP and sub-species origin.ResultsFitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies origin resulted in more significant SNPs (i.e. more power) than a conventional GWAS. Thus  the effect of a SNP depends on the subspecies that the allele originates from. Also  most QTL segregated in only one subspecies  suggesting that many mutations that affect the traits studied occurred after divergence of the subspecies or the mutation became fixed or was lost in one of the subspecies.ConclusionsThe results imply that GWAS and genomic selection could gain power by distinguishing SNP alleles based on their subspecies origin  and that only few QTL segregate in both  and  cattle. Thus  the QTL that segregate in current populations likely resulted from mutations that occurred in one of the subspecies and can have both positive and negative effects on the traits. There was no evidence that selection has increased the frequency of alleles that increase body weight."

However  the phase of LD between a SNP and a QTL may differ between  and  because they diverged at least one hundred thousand years ago. Here  we test the hypothesis that the apparent effect of a SNP on a quantitative trait depends on whether the SNP allele is inherited from a  or  ancestor. Phenotype data on one or more traits and SNP genotype data for 10 181 cattle from    and composite breeds were used. All animals had genotypes for 729 068 SNPs (real or imputed). Chromosome segments were classified as originating from  or  on the basis of the haplotype of SNP alleles they contained. Consequently  SNP alleles were classified according to their sub-species origin. Three models were used for the association study: (1) conventional GWAS (genome-wide association study)  fitting a single SNP effect regardless of subspecies origin  (2) interaction GWAS  fitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies-origin  and (3) best variable GWAS  fitting the most significant combination of SNP and sub-species origin. Fitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies origin resulted in more significant SNPs (i.e. more power) than a conventional GWAS. Thus  the effect of a SNP depends on the subspecies that the allele originates from. Also  most QTL segregated in only one subspecies  suggesting that many mutations that affect the traits studied occurred after divergence of the subspecies or the mutation became fixed or was lost in one of the subspecies. The results imply that GWAS and genomic selection could gain power by distinguishing SNP alleles based on their subspecies origin  and that only few QTL segregate in both  and  cattle. Thus  the QTL that segregate in current populations likely resulted from mutations that occurred in one of the subspecies and can have both positive and negative effects on the traits. There was no evidence that selection has increased the frequency of alleles that increase body weight. Taurine () and zebu () cattle are the only two surviving subspecies of wild cattle ( and constitute the majority of the cattle populations in the world. The estimated time of divergence between  () and  () ranges from 117 000 to 275 000 years according to mtDNA analyses [] and from 610 000 to 850 000 years according to microsatellite data analyses [].  and  cattle were domesticated independently in the Near East and in India respectively [  ]. The accuracy of genomic selection [  ] and the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be improved by increasing the number of animals with phenotypes and genotypes. Sample sizes can be increased by combining data from different breeds. However  genomic selection and GWAS depend on the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers (usually single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) and quantitative trait loci (QTL). Thus  since the extent and phase of LD can vary between breeds  combining data from different breeds can reduce the association between a SNP and trait phenotype. de Roos et al. [  ] reported that the phase of LD between adjacent markers on the 50 K Bovine SNP chip frequently differed among  cattle breeds  which means that the power of association studies based on the 50 K chip will be reduced when using multiple breeds because the LD between SNPs and QTL is unlikely to be conserved across breeds. In this study  we considered multiple breeds and used the Illumina high-density (HD) chip (~ 700 000 SNPs). We expected the LD phase to be largely conserved for typical distances between adjacent markers on the HD SNP chip (i.e.  5 kb) in  breeds (The Bovine Hap Map 2009). However  in addition to  breeds  beef cattle in Australia include a predominant  breed (Brahman) and composite breeds derived from crosses between  and . Assuming a divergence time of about 500 000 years  only chromosome segments of approximately 1 kb in length that segregated in  might still segregate in  or  cattle assuming 5 years per generation  recombinations over 10 generations will result in identity by descent segments of approximately 10 Morgan<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 kb; according to O’Rourke et al. []. Thus  it is unlikely that the LD between QTL and SNPs that are separated by<U+2009>~<U+2009>5 kb is conserved between the two subspecies. In fact  over 10 generations  it is likely that new QTL mutations occurred independently in  and  and some QTL  that segregated in the common ancestor  have become fixed in one of the two subspecies. Therefore  the aim of this paper was to determine how to analyse the HD SNP data on Brahman ()   and composite breeds so that QTL are clearly mapped to regions of the genome. The apparent effect of a SNP on phenotype depends on the LD between the SNP and the QTL  which as discussed above  can differ between the  and  breeds If the Australian bovine dataset did not include composite breeds  one could simply classify all alleles present in  breeds as  alleles and all alleles in the Brahman breed as  alleles and estimate the effects of each allele separately for the two subspecies. However  the presence of composite breeds introduces a complication and an opportunity. The complication is that the SNP alleles present in the composite breeds can originate either from  or . Therefore  to deal with this situation  all SNP alleles of the composite breeds were assigned either a  or  origin based on the identified origin (taurine or indicine) of the haplotype surrounding the SNP []. The opportunity is that the composite breeds will segregate for mutations that have been fixed for alternate alleles in  and  and therefore will lead to the identification of new QTL. This paper reports GWAS for growth  carcass and meat quality traits and compares the effect of indicine and taurine SNP alleles. We estimated the effect of the subspecies origin of each SNP allele  the effect of the SNP allele regardless of the subspecies origin  and the interaction between these two variables  and used this information to make inferences about the QTL that segregate in the two subspecies. The cattle were sampled from nine populations of three breed types  including four  breeds (1743 Angus  223 Murray Grey  717 Shorthorn and 613 Hereford)  one  breed (3384 Brahman cattle)  three composite (<U+2009>×<U+2009>) breeds (550 Belmont Red  598 Santa Gertrudis and 1826 Tropical composites)  and one recent Brahman cross population (527 F1 crosses of Brahman with Limousin  Charolais  Angus  Shorthorn  Hereford  Santa Gertrudis  Charbray and Belmont Red) [–]. A total of 10 181 animals of the three breed types (3384   3296   and 3501 <U+2009>× ) with SNP genotypes and measured for at least one trait were used in this study. Phenotypes for 12 different traits  including growth  feed intake  carcass and meat quality traits  were collated from five sources: the Beef Cooperative Research Centre Phase I (CRCI)  Phase II (CRCII)  Phase III (CRCIII)  the Trangie selection lines  and the Durham Shorthorn group (detailed description is in Bolormaa et al. []). Not all cattle were measured for all traits. The number of genotyped cattle with each trait in each dataset  trait definitions  heritability estimates and means and standard deviations (SD) are in Table . Data on 729 068 SNPs were used in this study  which were obtained from five different SNP panels: (1) the Illumina HD Bovine SNP chip ()  comprising 777 963 SNPs; (2) the BovineSNP50K version 1 and  (3) version 2 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego)  comprising 54 001 and 54 609 SNPs  respectively; (4) the IlluminaSNP7K panel  comprising 6909 SNPs; and (5) The ParalleleSNP10K chip (Affymetrix  Santa Clara  CA)  comprising 11 932 SNPs. All SNPs were mapped to the UMD 3.1 assembly of the bovine genome sequence provided by the Centre for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at University of Maryland (CBCB) (). Stringent quality control procedures were applied to the SNP data  separately for each platform and breed group. SNPs were excluded if the call rate per SNP (the proportion of SNP genotypes that have an Illumina GenCall score above 0.6) was less than 90% or showed an extreme departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (e.g.  SNPs on autosomal chromosomes with both homozygous genotypes observed  but no heterozygotes). If two SNPs had the same position but with different names  one of them was deleted from the data. Furthermore  animals with a call rate less than 90% were removed from the SNP data. High-density SNP genotypes were imputed for all animals using Beagle []. Details on imputation of the genomic dataset were described by Bolormaa et al. []. Briefly  imputations of the 7 K  10 K and 50 K SNP genotype data to the 729 068 SNPs were performed in two sequential stages: from 7 K or 10 K or 50 K data to a common 50 K data set and then from the common 50 K data set to 800 K data. In the first stage  imputation was done within breed  using 30 iterations of Beagle. In the second stage  the HD genotypes of each breed type (501  and 520 ) were used as a reference set to impute from the 50 K genotypes of each pure breed within the corresponding breed type. For the four composite breeds  all the HD genotypes (1698) were used as a reference set to impute the 50 K genotypes of each composite breed up to 800 K. Each chromosome was divided into non-overlapping segments consisting of 30 or 31 consecutive SNPs. The genotypes were phased using Beagle so that two haplotypes were defined for each animal for each segment. The probability ('b’) that a chromosome segment in a given animal carrying the  haplotype was of  origin was estimated using the following formula: []  where  is frequency of the  haplotype in  and  is frequency of the  haplotype in  animals. Preliminary results showed that  in some cases  the origin of a segment was inconclusive but that many of the surrounding segments were of the same subspecies origin. Because crosses between  and  cattle are recent events and  therefore  long chromosome segments are expected to have the same origin  a rolling average of 'b’ values across seven segments of 30 or 31 SNPs was calculated  which led to more segments being clearly classified as  or . As shown in Figure   this procedure resulted in most segments having a 'b’ value close to 1 (indicating a  origin) or close to zero (indicating a  origin). However  a few segments had 'b’ values near 0.6  which were arbitrarily classified as indicine if 'b’<U+2009>><U+2009>0.6 and taurine if 'b’<U+2009><<U+2009>0.6. The genotypes for each SNP were encoded in the top/top Illumina A/B format []. By combining this SNP coding with the subspecies origin of the chromosome segment in which the SNP occurred  we classified all SNP alleles into one of four types:  A   B   A  or  B.                                                                                                            A mixed model (fitting fixed and random effects simultaneously) was used to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The mixed model applied was: trait<U+2009>~<U+2009>mean<U+2009>+<U+2009>fixed effects<U+2009>+<U+2009>SNP<U+2009>+<U+2009>animal<U+2009>+<U+2009>error  with animal and their 5-generation-ancestors and error fitted as random effects and dataset  breed  cohort and sex as fixed effects for all traits. Other fixed effects differed by trait. Further details of the effects used for each data set are in Johnston []  Johnston et al. []  Reverter et al. []  Robinson and Oddy []  Barwick et al. []  Wolcott et al. [] and Bolormaa et al. []. The fixed effects were fitted as nested within a dataset. In addition to the fixed and random effects described above  each analysis included the effect of one SNP position (SNP). Since there are four alleles defined for each position (i.e.  indicine A  indicine B  taurine A  and taurine B)  three contrasts of one degrees-of-freedom (e.g. sub-species origin  allele within  and allele within ) are needed to compare all four alleles. We carried out several different analyses using different parameterisations of these contrasts (see Table  for a definition of the variables x to x). First  we carried out a “conventional GWAS” by ignoring the subspecies origin of the alleles and contrasting the A and B alleles  i.e. by fitting only variable x as defined in Table . Each animal has a genotype made up of two alleles  so the SNP variable analysed was the sum of the x’s for the two alleles  i.e. the analysis fits a regression of phenotype on the number of B alleles (0  1 or 2) in the SNP genotype of each animal. This analysis was performed using all data together  as well as separately for each of the three breed types (  Brahman and composites). Second  in the “interaction GWAS”  the three contrasts were fitted simultaneously by fitting the effect of the SNP allele (A vs B  variable x)  the effect of subspecies origin (.  vs   variable x) and the interaction between them (variable x). Each animal contains a paternal and maternal allele  so the full model for the effect of a SNP is: where  is the  variable for the paternal allele   is the  variable for the maternal allele  etc.   is the regression of phenotype on number of B alleles   is the regression of phenotype on the number of indicine alleles  and  is the regression of phenotype on the number of indicine B alleles. Since an interaction between SNP allele and subspecies origin can arise because a QTL segregates in only one of the two subspecies  a re-parameterisation of this “interaction” model was also tested by fitting subspecies origin (x)  allele within  (A vs B or variable x) and allele within  (A vs B or x). As in the previous model  this model includes paternal and maternal alleles  so the x variables for the maternal and paternal alleles were added together  resulting in the following model: where  and  are the regressions of phenotype on the number of taurine and indicine B alleles  respectively. This model is equivalent to the interaction model described above but tests a different set of three one-degree-of-freedom contrasts. The most parsimonious assumption is that a QTL will have two alleles and that they will be in highest LD with one of the seven variables defined in Table . For instance  if the QTL segregates only in  then variable x or x should be the most significant variable; if the mutant QTL allele is linked to the SNP A allele  then variable x will be most significant; but if the mutant QTL allele is linked to SNP allele B  then variable x should be most significant. In cases where one of x to x was the most significant variable we assume that the QTL segregates in only one subspecies and that the SNP allele which has an effect different to the other three alleles is tracking the mutant allele at the QTL. This also allows us to determine whether the effect of the QTL mutation is positive or negative for each trait. Therefore  in the final set of analyses  each variable x  x  x  x  x  and x (x is the same as x) was tested one at a time  by including it in the full model described above  to identify the variable that had the greatest association with the phenotype (the “best variable GWAS”). The distribution of the probability of  origin (rolling average of 'b’ values) for  and composite animals are shown in Figure . For  animals  'b’ values were low (close to 0) but only 7.1% of the 'b’ values were found in the range of 0.1<U+2009><<U+2009>b<U+2009><<U+2009>0.2 and 1.5% in the range of 0.2<U+2009><<U+2009>=b<U+2009><<U+2009>0.32  indicating some uncertainty  probably because many  breeds were included in the dataset. Using 'b’<U+2009><<U+2009>0.6 to indicate taurine origin  the estimated frequency of indicine segments in  breeds was 0  as expected  98% in Brahman  and 71 to 83% in composite breeds. GWAS  in which each SNP (variable x) was tested separately for an association with the trait  was performed for all animals together and separately for each breed type (   and <U+2009>×<U+2009>; Table ). This resulted in  e.g. 489 SNPs to be significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) for residual feed intake (RFI) in the joint analysis of all breed types. With 729 068 SNPs tested  this corresponds to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 14% (Table ). Estimates of the FDR of SNPs declared significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) differed between traits  with a low value for live weight  muscle shear force (LLPF)  and post-weaning IGF-I concentration (PWIGF)  ranging from 2 to 11% (Table )  and a moderate value (14% to 21%) for the remaining traits. For all traits except PWIGF  FDR was lower when all data were analysed jointly than when separate analyses were performed within each breed type (Table ). There was no consistent pattern for FDR when comparing the analyses of the three breed types; e.g.  for RFI  FDR was lower for  data than for the composite cattle data but for growth traits FDR was lower for Brahman and <U+2009>×<U+2009> data than for  data (Table ). Such results might reflect the presence of mutations of larger effect segregating in particular breed types  such as the  () polymorphism (chr14:25001906..25052394)  which segregates in Brahman and composite breeds but is close to fixation in [  ]. In such cases  many SNPs in the vicinity of the QTL were significant. Across traits  more than one SNP was found to be significant within short regions on chromosomes 5  7  14 and 29  which are near or within genes that are known to carry mutations with large effects affecting tenderness traits  such as    () (chr29:44064420..44089990)  and  () (chr7:98524257..98581260) [–]. In a number of cases  these SNPs had associations with more than one trait. For all traits  the number of significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) SNPs for the interaction GWAS  which fitted SNP allele (variable x)  subspecies of origin (x)  and their interaction (x)  was substantially greater than the number of significant SNPs in the conventional GWAS (Table ). This indicates that using the subspecies origin of each SNP allele increased power. Table  also shows the number of SNPs for which one of the three underlying variables was significant. The number of SNPs for which contrast of allele A vs B (variable x) was significant  was smaller than for the comparable contrast in the conventional GWAS (Table ) because in the interaction analysis  this variable was fitted after accounting for subspecies origin (variable x) (i.e. a conditional F-test). Subspecies origin of the allele was significant for many SNPs  in part because adjacent SNPs are highly correlated for x. Consequently  many SNPs surrounding the same QTL were significant for this variable and these contribute many counts in Table . The interaction between SNP and subspecies origin (variable x) was often significant  which indicates that the effect of an allele depended on the subspecies origin of the allele. If the LD phase between a QTL and a SNP differed randomly between  and   one would expect that sometimes the phase would be the same in both subspecies and sometimes it would be reversed. When the phase is the same  we would observe a significant SNP effect and when it was reversed or absent  we would observe a significant interaction. Thus  our results are consistent with the hypothesis that LD differs between  and . In Table   the main effect of the SNP is only slightly more often significant than the interaction  which suggests that there is little consistency in LD between .  and . . If a QTL was fixed for opposite alleles in the two subspecies  then subspecies origin of the allele (variable x) is expected to be the only significant variable. However  subspecies origin can be significant whenever there is a difference in QTL allele frequencies between  and . When this occurs  the QTL might be segregating in one subspecies or in both. To investigate this possibility  we re-parameterised the interaction model to fit the effects of subspecies origin (x)  of SNP allele within .  (x)  and of SNP allele within .  (x). The number SNPs that was significant for these two additional variables is also included in Table . For most traits  there were many SNPs for which the difference between the A and B alleles was significant within a subspecies. An extreme example is the trait HUMP but this trait was only recorded in Brahman cattle and composite breeds  so it is not surprising that the difference between alleles was seldom significant within  (All other traits were recorded in all breed types). Table  does not indicate how often the effect of a SNP was significant for both  and .  origins. Table  shows the number of SNPs for which one or more of the three one-degree-of-freedom contrasts was significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>10). For instance  for LLPF  two SNPs were significant for all three contrasts and these two SNPs were also significant in the conventional GWAS (in fact  these two SNPs are close to and within the  gene). The effect of a SNP was only rarely significant within both indicine and taurine origin (Table ). For instance  for PW-lwt  36 SNPs were significant within both indicine and taurine origin. On the rare occasions that this occurred  the effect was always in the same direction in both subspecies and the SNP was also significant in the conventional GWAS  which indicates that the phase of LD between the SNP and the QTL was the same in both subspecies. The most common pattern observed was that the SNP was significant within one of the subspecies origins and also for subspecies of origin (Table )  which is what one would expect if the QTL segregated in one subspecies only. Therefore  to address this possibility  we tested a series of one-degree-of-freedom contrasts at each position to find the most significant contrast. At each SNP position  we tested separately the effects of the main effect of SNP (x)  subspecies origin (x)  SNP within  (x and x)  and of SNP within  (x and x) to find the most significant contrast among the four alleles (indicine A  indicine B  taurine A and taurine B). We expect that the pattern of the most significant contrast will correspond to the pattern of segregation of the QTL  e.g. if x is the most significant contrast we expect that the QTL segregates only in  and that the A allele of the SNP is in LD with a QTL allele that does not occur in . Table  shows the number of SNPs for each trait for which at least one of these variables was significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>10. For instance  56 SNPs were significant for RFI. Table  also shows the proportion of these SNPs for which each variable was the most significant. For instance  among the 56 SNPs significant for RFI  55% had the main SNP variable (x) as the most significant variable. Tables  lists the SNPs for which one of the variables was significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10. The number of significant SNPs varied widely between traits (Table ). The four traits with the largest number of significant SNPs were LLPF  PW_lwt  PW_hip  and X_lwt and for each of these traits there were many SNPs for which the variable recording the sub-species origin of the allele was the most significant. These SNPs clustered in several genome regions because subspecies origin was highly correlated between neighbouring SNPs. However  in these clusters subspecies origin was seldom the most significant variable. That is  there was usually one SNP in the region where other variables (x  x to x) were more significant than subspecies origin (x). Consequently  when the significance threshold was increased to 5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  there were no SNPs for which subspecies of origin was the most significant variable (Table ). For traits other than LLPF  PW_lwt  PW_hip  and X_lwt  the most significant variable for a SNP could be any of the main SNP effect  the effect of SNP within  or of SNP within . This indicates that the QTL segregated in one or both of the subspecies. To avoid counting the same QTL many times  we chose only the most significant SNP (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) for each chromosome by trait combination. This resulted in 345 SNP-trait combinations (85 conventional SNPs  141 within  and 119 within )  representing 339 unique SNPs. Figure  plots the standardized estimate of the effect of an allele (effect estimate / standard error) against the corresponding allele frequency for the 260 SNP-trait combinations  within  and within . We interpret the allele with an effect different to that of the three other alleles to be tracking the mutant allele at the QTL. Therefore  the frequency and effect of this SNP allele is a guide to the frequency and effect of the mutant QTL allele. The frequency of the most significant allele within subspecies ranged from 0 to 1 and about 25% of the significant SNPs had a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.1. For most traits  both positive and negative effects occurred  although intramuscular fat (CIMF) and hump height (HUMP) were exceptions and had mostly positive effects. For height and live weight  both  and  breeds had SNP alleles with positive and negative effects. For CIMF and carcass rib fat (CRIB)  all significant effects were found within .  and most increased fatness or intra-muscular fat. No trait showed an obvious correlation between allele frequency and effect  as one might expect if selection was acting to increase the frequency of alleles with a positive effect.  <U+2009><U+2009>Only the SNP-trait combinations for which the most significant variable was an allele within <U+2009>(Bi) or <U+2009>(Bt) are plotted; allele frequency is indicated for the sub-species in which the allele was significant. There were 52 trait-SNP combinations for which one of the one-degree-of-freedom contrasts was significant at <U+2009><<U+2009>5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 (Table ). Of these  23 trait-SNP combinations (44%) showed the most significant contrast for the conventional SNP test  which suggests a QTL that segregated in both subspecies. However  in nearly half of these trait-SNP combinations (9/23)  the MAF of the SNP was less than 0.05 in one of the subspecies  which suggests that the QTL only segregated in the other subspecies. In eight of the remaining 14 trait-SNP combinations  the significant SNP was near the  gene on chromosome 14 that affects weight  height  fatness and RFI. For most SNPs in this region  the conventional SNP test was the most significant contrast but Fortes et al. [] showed that the  polymorphism is due to a  mutation that was introduced into Brahman cattle during grading up and was then selected for  perhaps because it increases height. The region between 47 and 50 Mb on chromosome 5 contains a series of SNPs that were significant for multiple traits  including X_lwt  PW_hip  HUMP  CIMF and CRIB (Table ). These associations  except with HUMP  are likely due to the same QTL. The most significant x-variable differed between SNPs but in all cases  except for HUMP  the results indicate a SNP that was nearly fixed for alternate alleles in the two subspecies. Consequently  when the conventional GWAS within each breed type is examined  there is no evidence for this QTL  except in the composite breeds. There also appears to be a QTL on chromosome 6 at 40 Mb that affects hip height and live weight that appears to segregate only in . The average of probability of  origin ('b’ values) across the genome was 0.98 for Australian Brahman cattle  which indicates that about 2% of their genes were estimated to be of taurine origin. This is less than the 10% that was estimated based on 50 K SNP data by Bolormaa et al. []. Similarly  the present analysis estimated that 70% of the genome of the F1 crosses was of  origin. Since F1 crosses include Charbray<U+2009>× Brahman and Santa Gertrudis<U+2009>×<U+2009>Brahman  the percentage of the genome that was of  origin was expected to exceed 50%. The  content estimated in our work may be slightly overestimated because we classified some taurine haplotypes as  because they occurred more often in Brahman cattle than in the Australian  cattle. For instance  a taurine haplotype that was not found in Australian  cattle might have been incorporated into Brahman cattle during grading up. However  this should have little effect on the overall results. For most traits  the FDR in the conventional GWAS was lower when all data were analysed jointly than when separate analyses were performed within each breed type. However  this probably reflects the increased size of the dataset in the joint analysis  rather than indicating that QTL segregate across  and  because a QTL segregating only in  would still segregate in the composite cattle. Indeed  evidence for a QTL in the same chromosome region in both  and composite breeds or in both  and composite breeds was frequent but the same QTL was rarely observed in all three breed types. In the interaction GWAS  the interaction between SNP allele and subspecies origin was frequently significant  which indicates that the effects of the SNP alleles on a trait depended on the subspecies from which they originated. When we re-parameterised this analysis  we found that many SNPs had significant effects within  origin or within  origin but seldom within both. Thus  the simplest interpretation of the data is that QTL usually segregate either within  or within . This is not surprising given that the two subspecies diverged about 10 generations ago and since then mutations have created new QTL independently in the two subspecies. If this is correct  then one subspecies is expected to be fixed for the ancestral allele and the other segregates for the ancestral and mutant allele. If the frequency of the mutant allele increases to a moderate value in the mutated subspecies  then a difference in effect between alleles from  and  is expected (i.e.  significant variable x)  as well as an effect within one subspecies. This is exactly the pattern that we found most commonly. The variable that best fitted the data was either x  x  x or x. These variables compare one allele from one subspecies against the other allele from the same subspecies and both alleles from the other subspecies. The simplest interpretation would be that one SNP allele is in linkage phase with the mutant allele at the QTL and the other three alleles are associated with the ancestral allele at the QTL. Even if this interpretation is correct only in a majority of cases  it allows us to estimate approximately the frequency and effect of the mutant allele at the QTL. Figure  shows  under this interpretation  that mutations that affect weight have occurred in both  and   with some that increase and others that decrease weight. As a result of drift and selection  these mutant alleles have frequencies ranging from near 0 to near 1 but there was no evidence that selection had systematically increased the frequency of alleles that increase weight. Not all traits show the same pattern as that obtained for weight. Mutations that affect hump appear to have occurred only in  and to predominantly increase hump size (Figure ). This could be due to lack of power in our data to detect alleles in  that affect hump but it could also indicate that mutations that increase hump size have been selected in  cattle. Similarly  mutations that affect intra-muscular fat seem to have occurred primarily in  and most of these increased intra-muscular fat percentage  which could be a result of direct or indirect selection for marbling in . Some of the QTL detected here have been reported previously. The QTL near  on chromosome 14 affects many traits (live weight  height  carcass  meat quality and IGF-I traits) and segregates in both  and   although the mutation arose in  and was introgressed in Brahman cattle during grading up []. In our analysis  the most significant SNPs associated with hip height (Table ) had a frequency of 0.95 in   which indicates that the mutant allele  which has a positive effect on height  is almost fixed in the  breeds in Australia. The QTL for shear force that we detected on chromosomes 7 and 29 have been identified previously as polymorphisms in the genes [  ] and [    ]. The polymorphism in the  gene was reported to segregate in both  and [] at allele frequencies of 0.82-0.99 and 0.57-0.65  respectively. In agreement with this  we found that the best variable for shear force on chromosome 7 was that for a conventional SNP test  with frequencies close to the frequencies of the mutation within each subspecies (i.e. 0.9 in  and 0.76 in ). For   the frequencies of the favourable allele (that reduces shear force) in  and  were 0.11 and 0.81  respectively (Table )  in agreement with previous results []  i.e. 0.19-0.21 in  and 0.83-0.84 in . The QTL on chromosome 5 at 49 Mb (Table ) affected many traits and appeared to be nearly fixed for alternate alleles in  and  and consequently it was not possible to determine which allele is the mutant or in which subspecies it occurred. The gene  () is near this position and has been reported to affect height  fatness and fat distribution in humans  mouse  horse and pig [–]. By comparison  the QTL on chromosome 6 at about 40 Mb (Table ) appears to have arisen in  due to a mutation that decreases height and weight and now has an allele frequency of 0.1. These results have implications for future GWAS and for genomic selection when cattle that have both  and  origins are used. The same SNP allele may not be in phase with the same QTL allele in both subspecies and so it would be useful to distinguish the subspecies origin of SNP alleles when they are used for GWAS or genomic selection. Selection in composite breeds can also benefit from selecting the taurine allele at some sites and the indicine allele at others to capture the 'best of the two subspecies’. However  only a few QTL are fixed for alternate alleles in the two subspecies. The most common pattern is that the QTL segregates in one subspecies and is fixed in the other. Our results suggest that  although some QTL may segregate in both  and  because the QTL existed in their common ancestor  it is more frequent that a mutation created a QTL in only one of the two sub-species since they diverged. Consequently  the LD between a SNP and nearby QTL is not expected to be the same in both subspecies and a SNP by subspecies interaction is associated with phenotype. By classifying SNP alleles according to subspecies origin  we were able  in many cases  to estimate which QTL allele was ancestral and which allele was derived and their effect on traits. The derived or mutant alleles occurred at a wide range of frequencies  with positive and negative effects on the traits studied. However  some traits are exceptions  i.e. QTL that affect the size of the hump were due to mutations having occurred in  and these mutations predominantly increased hump size.

Simple graphical tests that are used in this paper are a current  yet tedious solution. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are continuous stretches of homozygous genotypes without heterozygosity in the diploid state. Although ROH can arise by different mechanisms []  the primary cause is believed to be inbreeding []. Long ROH are most likely the result of recent inbreeding  where recombination events do not shorten identical haplotypes inherited from the common ancestor. Short ROH  in contrast  suggest more ancient inbreeding. The ability of ROH to reveal information about ancient and recent genetic events makes them useful tools to analyze population history []  inbreeding levels [] and effects of inbreeding on complex traits and congenital disorders []. While ROH from high-throughput genotyping analyses have been studied extensively in humans  such analyses are rare in cattle and other livestock species [–]. The lack of standards for ROH definition and identification may introduce bias in ROH-based estimates of autozygosity. Howrigan et al. [] found that the numbers and sizes of ROH that are identified in genotyping data can strongly depend on certain parameters and thresholds imposed during sequence analysis. In addition  pruning single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that show low minor allele frequency (MAF)  that deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)  or that show high linkage disequilibrium (LD)  can affect the results [  ]. The density of the SNP chip used to generate the data for ROH identification is another factor that strongly affects autozygosity estimates. Purfield et al. [] compared estimates obtained using the two SNP chips most frequently used in cattle: the Illumina BovineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip with 54 001 SNPs (50 k) and the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip with 777 972 SNPs (HD). They concluded that the 50 k chip is appropriate only for identifying ROH longer than 5 Mb. Indeed  analyses based on lower-density chips can fail to detect heterozygous SNP genotypes that are present in observed ROH. The frequency of SNP genotyping errors is another factor that can affect ROH-based estimates of autozygosity. Since this frequency usually varies between 0.2% and 1.0% [  ]  it may affect identification of very long ROH that contain numerous SNPs. In fact  any genotyping error  whether homozygote to heterozygote or vice versa  can affect the determination of ROH. A potential solution is to allow a certain number of SNPs to be heterozygous []  but whether this compromises the reliability of ROH analyses has not been systematically analyzed. The aim of this study was to analyze the identification of ROH of different length categories and the estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients based on ROH in three cattle breeds (Brown Swiss  Pinzgauer  Tyrol Grey). Our study focused on the effects of chip density (777 972 versus 54 001 SNPs) and genotyping errors. Results demonstrate  both graphically and statistically  that density of SNP chips affects ROH detection and subsequent estimation of inbreeding levels. The optimal number of heterozygous SNPs allowed during ROH analysis was found to depend on chip density and ROH length. The semen samples of the animals included in this study used for DNA extraction and genotyping  were obtained from AI centers through their routine practice in the framework of breeding programs. Therefore  no ethical approval was required for sampling of biological material. DNA samples were obtained from 277 bulls of three breeds: Brown Swiss  46; Pinzgauer  118; and Tyrol Grey  113. Mean pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients (and ranges) were as follows: Brown Swiss  0.033 (0.009-0.096); Pinzgauer  0.019 (0–0.088); and Tyrol Grey  0.022 (0–0.169). The mean complete generation equivalent (see e.g.  [] was highest for Brown Swiss (7.32 generations) and lowest for Pinzgauer (5.32 generations). DNA samples were genotyped using the BovineHD Bead Chip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA)  which contains 777 972 SNPs; this data set is referred to hereafter as the high-density (HD) panel. For comparison  we extracted and retained SNPs from this panel that were common to both the HD panel and the bovine SNP50 Beadchip v1 (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA)  which contains 54 001 SNPs and which will be referred to in the remainder as the 50 k panel. Data extraction and quality control were performed separately for each breed. We excluded all SNPs that had not been assigned to a chromosome or that had been assigned to chromosomes X or Y or to the mitochondrial genome. We also excluded SNPs for which more than 10% of genotypes were missing and SNPs with an Illumina GenCall score = 0.7 or an Illumina GenTrain score = 0.4. Two Tyrol Grey bulls were excluded from further analysis because more than 5% of their genotypes were missing. In doing this  our objective was to exclude poorly performing loci and minimize risk of genotyping errors. After quality control  the numbers of SNPs in the HD and 50 k panels were as follows for each breed: Brown Swiss  615 618 and 38 710; Pinzgauer  606 120 and 38 198; and Tyrol Grey  684 172 and 42 997. Although it is customary in genome-wide association studies and ROH analyses to exclude SNPs with low MAF or high LD with neighboring SNPs or that deviate from HWE  we did not apply such exclusion criteria in our study. Instead we relied on Illumina quality scores (GenCall  GenTrain) to reduce genotyping problems. We also defined the minimum ROH length as 1 Mb to exclude short  common ROH arising from LD [  ]. ROH were identified in every individual using the SNP & Variation Suite (v7.6.8 Win64; Golden Helix  Bozeman  MT  USA ). This algorithm is designed to find stretches of consecutive homozygous SNPs; it works continuously across an entire chromosome  examining every possible run that matches the user-specified parameters. We chose this software instead of the PLINK ROH algorithm []  which uses a sliding window that may introduce artificial runs and fail to identify segments longer than the window. ROH exceeding the allowed number of heterozygotes or missing SNPs were checked automatically to determine whether they should be removed based on their length  SNP density  and user-specified parameters. ROH were called if 15 or more consecutive homozygous SNPs [] were present at a density of at least 1 SNP every 100 kb  with gaps of no more than 1000 kb between them. These density and gap thresholds were applied to SNPs in both the HD and 50 k panels to ensure comparability of the results. Five categories of ROH length (in Mb) were defined: [1 2]  (2  4]  (4  8]  (8  16]  and >16. The number of heterozygous SNPs allowed was set to different values for different length categories. First  we called ROH without allowing any heterozygous calls  and we obtained the average numbers of SNPs in each length category (Table ). We then assumed a genotype error rate of 0.25%  recalculated the numbers of heterozygote calls allowed  and rounded the number of heterozygous SNPs allowed to the nearest whole number. This approach led to the following numbers of heterozygous SNPs allowed for each length category (in Mb) in the HD panel: [1 2]  one heterozygeous SNP; (2  4]  two heterozygous SNPs; (4  8]  four heterozygous SNPs; (8  16]  eight heterozygous SNPs; and >16  16 heterozygous SNPs (Table   class C). In the case of the 50 k panel  we allowed one heterozygous SNP for length category >16  and no heterozygous SNPs for the other categories (Table   class A). Like the number of heterozygous SNPs  we set the number of missing SNPs allowed to different values for different length categories. First  we determined ROH allowing any number of missing SNPs and then used the results to set limits. This approach led to the following limits for missing SNPs for each ROH length category (in Mb) in the HD and 50 k panels  respectively: [1 2]  four or no missing SNPs; (2  4]  eight or no missing SNPs; (4  8]  16 or one missing SNP; (8  16]  32 or two missing SNPs; and > 16  64 or four missing SNPs. Statistically  is defined as the length of the autosomal genome present in ROH  divided by the overall length of the autosomal genome covered by the SNPs []. For each bull  we calculated        and  based on ROH of different minimum lengths (> 1  > 2  > 4  > 8 or > 16 Mb).  was calculated for different minimum ROH lengths because lengths of autozygous segments in a genome are predicted to show an exponential distribution  with a mean length equal to 1/2 g Morgan  where g is the number of generations since the common ancestor (e.g. []). If the genome of an individual contains segments as short as 1 Mb  we can conclude that the individual’s autozygosity originated from common ancestors up to 50 generations in the past. Based on the  values across all ROH lengths  detected with both 50 k and HD panel  correlations with pedigree inbreeding coefficients were calculated in order to investigate their relationships. Mean values of  were calculated within classes (scenarios) in which different numbers of heterozygous SNPs were allowed in each ROH length category. Eight classes (A to H) were defined  two (A and B) for the 50 k panel and six (C-H) for the HD panel (Table ). Numbers of heterozygous SNPs allowed within a class were based on the average numbers of SNPs in a length category and an assumed genotyping error rate of 0.25% for classes A and C. The other classes were formed by successively halving the allowed number of heterozygotes and only considering longer segments (see Table ). Mean  values obtained when allowing different numbers of heterozygous SNPs were compared within the same length category using paired t-tests. In addition   values were compared between the 50 k and HD panels. The SAS 9.3 [] procedure TTEST with the PAIRED statement was used to generate p values. The step-down Bonferroni method of Holm [] using the MULTTEST procedure and the HOLM statement was used to adjust the p values of the 186 comparisons. Across all three cattle breeds  we identified 19 392 ROH segments using the 50 k panel and 14 148 ROH segments using the HD panel (Table ). For all three breeds  analysis with the 50 k panel identified more ROH > 1 Mb than the HD panel. The two panels gave similar numbers of ROH > 4 Mb. As ROH length increased  the HD panel yielded a higher number of ROH than the 50 k panel (Figure ). The 50 k panel revealed an abundance of small segments and overestimated the numbers of segments 1–4 Mb long  suggesting that it is not sensitive enough for the precise determination of small segments.  ROH were identified using 50 k and HD panel data and then overlaid; each row represents one animal  and different colors were used to indicate whether ROH segments were identified using both the 50 k and HD panel (black)  only the 50 k panel (red)  or only the HD panel (blue). The 50 k panel did  however  prove suitable for detecting segments longer than 4 Mb. This finding is consistent with that of Purfield et al. []  who concluded that the 50 k panel recognizes only segments longer than 5 Mb as well as the HD panel does. The 50 k and HD panels gave noticeably different distributions and mean values of ROH length within each length category (Figure ). Differences were greatest for the [  ] length category  and then gradually disappeared as ROH length increased. These findings provide further evidence that data from the 50 k panel lead to imprecise determination of short ROH and overestimation of .  Overlay of box plots and kernel density plots that show the distribution of the total ROH length among all Brown Swiss bulls (orange)  Pinzgauer bulls (blue) and Tyrol Grey bulls (green) for five ROH length categories; box plots (black) are shown inside the density plots  and horizontal red lines indicate mean values; the left half of each density and box plot was obtained from the 50 k panel data  while the right half was obtained from the HD panel data. To our knowledge  a simulation study by Howrigan et al. [] is the only source of recommendations on the number of heterozygous calls allowed in ROH. They suggested allowing no heterozygous calls. However  since genotyping errors in SNP chip data do occur  it seems more reasonable to allow some heterozygous calls  particularly for ROH > 8 Mb on dense SNP chips. These long segments are much more frequent in cattle populations than in human populations  even for population isolates (e.g. []). We determined the numbers of SNPs in ROH of specific lengths and assumed a 0.25% rate of genotyping errors in order to define the number of heterozygous genotypes allowed separately for each ROH length category. Then  we determined mean  values for the classes defined in Table  for different allowed numbers of heterozygous calls. Paired t-tests were conducted within the eight classes (A-H) within the same length category and within each cattle breed (Table ). The 50 k and HD panel data gave significantly different mean  values in Pinzgauer and Tyrol Grey cattle  and significantly different mean  and  values in the Brown Swiss and Pinzgauer breeds. For all three breeds  mean  based on the 50 k panel differed significantly depending on whether one (class A) or no (class B) heterozygous calls were allowed. These differences had important effects on estimates of inbreeding levels. For each breed  inbreeding levels based on  based on the HD panel differed by approximately 1.7-fold  depending on whether 16 or no heterozygous calls were allowed (Table ). In fact  inbreeding coefficients derived from ROH > 16 Mb with no allowance for heterozygous calls were lower than inbreeding coefficients estimated from pedigrees. These findings suggest that for such long ROH  which can have more than 5000 to 6000 SNPs  some heterozygous calls must be allowed due to the possibility of genotyping errors. At the same time  the number of allowable heterozygous calls should be limited. On the one hand  SNP data from chromosome 20 in the 46 Brown Swiss cattle (Figure ) shows clearly that single  potentially miscalled heterozygous SNPs would interrupt ROH segments if such SNPs were not allowed. On the other hand  the figure also shows that allowing certain minimum numbers of heterozygous SNPs leads to inaccurate ROH calling at the ends of ROH. Such inaccurate calling is also likely to be a problem in individual ROH  since we sometimes observed multiple heterozygous SNPs close together within a ROH  not only when using the SNP & Variation software suite but also when using other programs (PLINK; []; cgaTOH; []; data not shown). In any event  ROH identification software should be improved so that instances of multiple heterozygous SNPs very close to one another should automatically lead the program to define separate ROH. Until such an improvement is made  we recommend careful visual analysis of ROH segment structure in order to exclude spurious ROH.  Light pink and light green colors represent homozygous and heterozygous SNPs  respectively; ROH are represented by white blocks  while missing SNPs are indicated in black; red lines within ROH indicate the presence of heterozygous SNPs; each row represents one animal. The HD panel gave the following mean  values across all ROH lengths: Brown Swiss  0.151; Pinzgauer  0.062; and Tyrol Grey  0.066. Short ROH  i.e. 1 to 2 Mb long  covered an average of 36.7 Mb of the 2.3 Gb of the autosomal cattle genome covered with SNPs (Figure )  with the highest short-ROH coverage observed in Brown Swiss and the lowest in Pinzgauer  the total genome length covered by all ROH > 1 Mb was 24.5% for one Brown Swiss bull and 23.0% for one Tyrol Grey bull. ROH > 16 Mb covered an average of 66.1 Mb of genome  although this number varied widely from animal to animal and between breeds. The highest long ROH coverage was observed in Brown Swiss and the lowest in Pinzgauer cattle. Some animals lacked such long ROH  whereas others showed a few that covered more than 300 Mb. The greatest genome coverage by long ROH was observed in a Tyrol Grey bull  in which 12 long ROH segments covered 368.6 Mb  corresponding to an average segment length of ˜30 Mb. The length of an autozygous segment indicates its age; since haplotypes are broken up by meiotic recombination  a short autozygous region is likely to have an ancient origin  while a long one probably arose recently [  ]. These findings suggest that the Brown Swiss breed experienced both recent and ancient inbreeding events to a higher degree than the two other breeds. Correlations of  values across all ROH lengths with pedigree inbreeding coefficients were similar to those previously reported by Ferencakovic et al. []. Correlations for the 50 k panel were 0.62  0.65 and 0.77 for Brown Swiss  Pinzgauer and Tyrol Grey  respectively  and corresponding values were 0.61  0.62 and 0.75 for the HD panel. Differences in correlations between panels within breeds were not statistically significant. Variation of these values is most likely due to the fact that pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients do not account for variation in meiosis  inheritance of segments of chromosomes and LD. The genomic distribution of ROH based on the HD panel data shows that 99.98% of SNPs occurred within an ROH of at least one individual. However  the frequency with which different SNPs occurred within ROH was not uniform across the genome  revealing genomic regions with abundant ROH  called ROH hotspots  which are also often detected in human populations [  ]. Several ROH hotspots were common to all three breeds. For example  two hotspots were identified on chromosome 6 in all three breeds: one at 5.3-6.3 Mb and another at 38.4-39.5 Mb (Figure ). Why these hotspots occur  and how they compare among cattle breeds and with other animal species  are questions currently under investigation.  ROH on chromosome 6 from Brown Swiss  Pinzgauer and Tyrol Grey bulls identified using HD panel data; each row represents one animal. ROH identification in cattle is usually performed with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Genotyping BeadChip (50 k panel) or the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip (HD panel). Here  we report that data from the 50 k panel do not represent the true state of autozygosity well for short ROH segments  while it is as reliable as the HD panel data for ROH > 4 Mb. When shorter segments are included with the 50 k panel   is systematically overestimated. The bias due to potential genotyping errors depends on the allowance of heterozygous genotypes in a ROH calling software. While not allowing for heterozygous calls often just splits a very long ROH in two shorter ones that are still recognized and therefore the level of autozygosity of an individual is virtually unaffected  there are many cases where the shorter part of the split does not reach the minimum size of a ROH and the level of autozygosity of an individual is underestimated. Allowing many heterozygous calls in an ROH adds many short segments that are most likely not autozygous to the terminal regions of ROH. Our aim was to provide guidelines to identify ROH from high-throughput SNP genotype data. First  quality control should be performed by removing SNPs based on strict limits on genotype quality scores provided to reduce genotyping errors. Second  the number of heterozygous SNPs allowed should be determined separately for each ROH length of interest and for each SNP density  as suggested here. Third  if multiple heterozygous SNPs are allowed within the same ROH  adjacent heterozygous SNPs should be treated differently from heterozygous SNPs that are further apart. Because no current ROH identification software takes care of adjacent heterozygous SNPs  careful visual inspection of ROH segments should be applied to exclude spurious ROH called by the software.

Furthermore  potential macro-environmental changes (diet  climatic region  etc.) may make genetic heterogeneity of variance a less stable trait over time and space. In livestock and aquaculture production systems  individuals that can perform well in different environments and against different background genetics are preferred. In evolutionary genetics  the term canalization describes the stability or buffering ability of a genotype against minor variations  not only in the environment but also in the genetic make-up []. In animal breeding  genetic differences in phenotypic stability can be detected as genetic heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance  where a low variance indicates stable performance across environmental factors. Genetic heterogeneity of residual variance has been estimated for different traits in a number of land-based species  e.g.  litter size in sheep []  pigs []  mice [] and rabbits [] and weight in piglets [] and broilers [] (review of Hill and Mulder []) and more recently somatic cell scores and milk yield in dairy cattle [] and body weight in rainbow trout []. Overall  these studies show substantial genetic heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance but heritability of individual dispersion as defined in [] is usually low (<0.05). This is due to the fact that the dispersion parameters of an individual cannot be measured directly but are inferred through estimated residual(s) (i.e.  deviations from the expected mean)  which are expected to be distributed around zero regardless of the underlying variance. Hence  a single individual phenotype does not convey much information about the underlying variance  although differences between family groups may be substantial and estimable. The presence of genetic heterogeneity of residual variance suggests that selection to change residual variance is possible  based mainly on family information. Thus  large families will be an advantage to study the genetic heterogeneity of variance. In fish species  both sexes are usually highly fecund  with a potential for large full- and half-sib families. The aims of this study were twofold: (1) quantify the genetic heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance for body weight in Atlantic salmon and (2) test whether the observed heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance can be explained by simple scaling effects. We also discuss the data structures that are best suited for estimating variance heterogeneity and individual breeding values for residual variance. The analysis was restricted to year-class 2008 of Atlantic salmon from the AquaGen breeding program (). Descriptive statistics of the dataset are in Table . Data included body weight records until harvest for 13 633 fish. Fish that were sexually mature or had visible deformities were excluded from the analysis. Potential outliers were not removed from the raw data  because this could remove the real effects that we wanted to study  e.g.  occurrence of runts (undersized animals)  which is a known phenomenon in Atlantic salmon. For the production of families  both dams and sires were mated with a maximum of two partners. The final dataset included 502 full-sib families from 346 sires and 324 dams. Of these parents  156 sires and 178 dams were represented with two full-sib offspring groups  a structure that facilitates proper separation of common (non-additive) family effects  e.g.  effects due to common rearing  maternal effects and potential dominance genetic effects. The theory behind the data analysis was previously described in detail by Rönnegård et al. []. Both untransformed  log- and square root-transformed data were analyzed. Transformation was applied to study the potential relationships between mean and variance (scaling effects). Sire-dam models are often used in aquaculture breeding [–]  especially for non-normal (e.g. binary) traits  and were used here to model heterogeneity of variance. In animal models  the full additive genetic effect (mid-parent mean<U+2009>+<U+2009>Mendelian sampling deviation) of each animal is fitted  whereas sire-dam models only fit the additive genetic mid-parent means (sire<U+2009>+<U+2009>dam effects) and the Mendelian sampling deviations of the offspring are included in the residuals of the model. When parents do not have own phenotypes  an animal mean model allowing for heterogeneous residual variance is equivalent to a sire-dam model in which the residual of an individual  is defined as []: where  and  are  respectively  the Mendelian sampling deviation and the micro-environmental residual of individual   and the variance of  is thus equal to: where  is the (homogeneous) additive genetic variance and  is the (heterogeneous) micro-environmental residual variance for animal  in the mean animal model. Hence  fitting an animal mean model with heterogeneous residual variance necessarily implies that the Mendelian sampling variance is assumed identical for all animals  i.e.  that variance heterogeneity is strictly micro-environmental within each individual. Because a sire-dam mean model includes the Mendelian sampling deviations into the residuals  the variance model is used to model the full within-family variance. Thus  a sire-dam variance model implies that genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in the mean model is completely explained by sire and dam effects. However  if genetic heterogeneity of variance exists  Mendelian sampling deviations are also expected to affect the level of residual variance and an animal model for the variance would be theoretically more correct. However  in our cross-sectional data (i.e. one observation per individual)  these Mendelian sampling deviations only affect the variance of a single observation  i.e.  some residuals will be more or less extreme than expected  but the overall effect of within-family variance on genetic heterogeneity will probably be small. Against this background  the following models were used and compared in this study. This is a classical linear mean animal model for body weight at a given age. where  is the vector of recorded body weights (untransformed  log-  or square root-transformed) for all fish   is a vector of fixed effects (includes the effect of group of rearing at early life stages (2 groups))   ~  is a vector of additive genetic effects   ~  is a vector of common environmental family effects   ~  is a vector of random residuals  the matrices    and  are appropriate incidence matrices and  is an identity matrix of appropriate size. The mean sub-model of the DHGLM is a classical linear mean animal model for body weight at a given age  as given above. However  the residual variance is modeled using a gamma sire-dam model  where: where  is a vector of fixed effects on dispersion (equal to those for the mean model) and  is a vector of additive genetic sire and dam effects on dispersion with distribution   where . The matrices    and  are row incidence vectors associated with observation   for the fixed  sire  and dam effects  respectively. Since the residuals are unobserved  but rather estimated as   equation () is reformulated as: and can be fitted using a gamma model with weights (1-)/2  where  is the  diagonal element in the hat matrix of the mean sub-model; the hat matrix is described in Rönnegård et al. []. This model is similar to the DHGLM1 described above  except that the additive genetic animal effect in the mean model is replaced by additive genetic effects of the sire and the dam (as in the variance model): where  is a vector of additive genetic effects (on the mean) of the sire and the dam. Restricted maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate variance components with the ASREML software []. For the DHGLM models  an iterative approach within the R environment ()  alternating between weighted analyses of the mean and variance sub-models was used  with weights being updated for each round  as described in Rönnegård et al. []. Variance components estimated based on the different models are in Table  for the untransformed data  in Table  for the log-transformed data and in Table  for the square root-transformed data. The linear mean animal model revealed considerable amounts of additive genetic variance for body weight in Atlantic salmon  with a genetic variance of 0.30 kg and a heritability of 0.36<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 (0.32<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 and 0.35<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 for log- and square root-transformed data  respectively). However  for both the original and transformed data  the two DHGLM models deviated considerably from each other. The DHGLM2 (sire-dam model) and the classical linear mean animal model gave similar estimates of genetic (after appropriate rescaling) and common environmental variances on the mean  whereas the DHGLM1 (animal/sire-dam model) produced a considerably lower (~ -70%) estimate of genetic variance and a much larger (~ +300%) estimate of common environmental variance on the mean. With the linear mean animal model (ignoring heterogeneity of within-family variance)  genetic variance is estimated based on covariance between relatives. Hence  even in the presence of genetic heterogeneity of within-family variance  the mean model is expected to produce unbiased estimates of the genetic variance on the mean level  which was also confirmed in a preliminary simulation study (results not shown). Since the linear mean animal model is expected to give unbiased estimates of genetic variance (on the mean)  the discrepancy between estimates from the linear mean animal model and the DHGLM1 indicates that the latter model is substantially biased  while the DHGLM2 appears appropriate. For the variance sub-model  the estimated sire-dam genetic variances from DHGLM2 for the untransformed and transformed data were 0.04<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 and 0.03<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 (log- and square root)  respectively. The sire-dam variance component is ¼ of the total genetic variance  for the trait (sire and dam combined explain ½ ). Thus  the results obtained with DHGLM2 for all transformations indicate that genetic variance in canalization exists  which implies that families differed in their sensitivity to environmental (and potentially genetic) changes. The importance of the genetic heterogeneity of within-family variance can be illustrated by the following example. Assuming a population with an average within-family variance for body weight of 0.67 (as in the current untransformed dataset)  equation () implies an expectation on the log scale of <U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.40. A log-scale 95% prediction interval for mid-parent variance breeding values  i.e. the interval for which 95% of future families is expected to fall in absence of selection  can then be defined as   which corresponds to within-family variances of body weight in the range [ <U+2009>]<U+2009>=<U+2009>[0.38 <U+2009>1.18]. This shows that the variation of the most extreme high families is expected to be approximately three times larger than the extreme low families. Pearson correlation coefficients between estimated breeding values for the mean and variance sub-models using DHGLM2 were all significantly different from zero  but differed substantially between transformations (0.42  -0.17 and 0.14 for untransformed  log-transformed and square root transformed data  respectively). Thus  transformation of the data makes estimated breeding values for the mean and variance more independent. This may also explain the somewhat reduced genetic variance of the variance model after transformation. The main result of this study is that substantial heterogeneity of within-family variance exists for body weight in Atlantic salmon. Furthermore  the iterative approach revealed that the DHGLM animal mean model (DHGLM1) resulted in severely biased estimates of variance components when employed with cross-sectional data  both when compared with a linear mean animal model and a sire-dam DHGLM (DHGLM2) model. Since genetic heterogeneity of variance exists between families  an equivalent genetic heterogeneity must also exist within families. Hence  an animal model should ideally be fitted in both the mean and the variance sub-models of the DHGLM. This would be of particular importance for datasets with repeated records on individuals  and such data structures would allow proper estimation of variances on an individual level. However  the current dataset contained cross-sectional data (one observation per individual)  which implies that the variance cannot be estimated on the individual level but only for groups of individuals (families). This may explain why any attempt to model the variance using an animal model did not converge  possibly due to the iterative approach used  where one iterates between the mean and variance sub-models and the models are thus allowed to interact. In earlier studies  more approximate non-iterative methods have been used [    ]  where a linear mean animal model is fitted first and the variance model is subsequently applied to the (log of) squared residuals. For these non-iterative methods (with fixed variance “phenotypes” coming from a linear mean model)  animal variance models could be fitted. For the more advanced iterative approaches  more research is needed on the optimization of data structures with respect to proper identification of individual breeding values for the variance. Since genetic variance in the classical linear mean animal model is estimated based on between-family variation in observed mean phenotypes  the estimated genetic variance is expected to be unbiased. Likewise  the estimated residual variance is expected to reflect the typical level of within-family variation. This would be the case even if the true underlying model includes genetic heterogeneity of residual variance  which was confirmed in a simulation study with 200 families of 40 individuals resulting from a perfect 2 sires<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 dams mating system of 100 sires and 100 dams (results not shown). In principle  the DHGLM models are expected to give similar genetic variance estimates on the mean as the linear mean animal model  because these estimates are also based on observed between-family variation. Hence  in the real data analysis  the mean sub-models of the two DHGLM models are expected to give similar results as a linear mean animal model. This was indeed the case for the DHGLM2 model but the DHGLM1 model showed substantial deviations. Hence  the results of this study indicate that the DHGLM1 model is severely biased when the data does not contain repeated records. The two DHGLM models differed in the flexibility of the variance sub-model; in the DHGLM1 model  the Mendelian sampling variance is assumed homogeneous (and restricted to )  while DHGLM2 includes the Mendelian sampling effects in the residuals  and the entire within-family variance is modeled by the variance sub-model  allowing for heterogeneity. The latter is consistent with the concept of canalization  which leads to genetic heterogeneity of variance due to varying sensitivities to potentially both environmental and genetic perturbations []. If sensitivities to both environmental and genetic perturbations contribute to the observed heterogeneity of variance  the underlying assumption of DHGLM1 is violated while DHGLM2 would still be appropriate. Our initial hypothesis was therefore that the bias of the DHGLM1 model was due to an incorrect assumption of homogeneous Mendelian sampling variance. To test this  we fitted the DHGLM1 and DHGLM2 models to simulated cross-sectional data (as described above)  using either homogeneous (as in DHGLM1) or heterogeneous Mendelian sampling variances (appropriate for DHGLM2); the residual (micro-environmental) variance was always heterogeneous  which is consistent with both models. The results were striking: the DHGLM1 model always resulted in biased estimates of the variance components (similar to the real data analysis)  even when the Mendelian sampling variance was homogeneous  while DHGLM2 was unbiased in both cases (results not shown). Hence  DHGLM1 was biased even when its assumptions were true. Furthermore  we found that the bias was restricted to statistical models in which both animal additive genetic and common environmental family effects were fitted in the mean sub-model  i.e.  when between-family variance on the mean can potentially be explained by common environmental factors. Thus  it appears that DHGLM models that include random family-specific effects (genetic and/or common environment) in the variance sub-model will use these to describe as much of the within-family variance as possible. This would be appropriate for sire-dam mean sub-models (since the entire within-family variance is included in the residual variance) but is not appropriate for animal mean sub-models (since Mendelian deviations are included in the additive genetic effects). Again  such bias is more likely observed in iterative methods such as those of Rönnegård et al. []  which allow the mean and variance sub-models to interact with each other. However  a non-iterative procedure  like the one applied in [    ]  should not be used without critically assessing the assumptions []  because there is a risk of drawing conclusions from data that contains no (or very little) information to infer genetic heterogeneity of the residual variance. We have chosen to quantify the genetic heterogeneity in terms of variance components rather than heritability because variance components in the variance sub-model are easier to interpret and are comparable across experiments and species (when an exponential model for the variance is used). For instance  a genetic variance of 0.17 in the variance model  as found for DHGLM2  can be expressed as a standard deviation of 0.41 (i.e. the square-root of 0.17)  which implies that a unit standard deviation increase/decrease of the breeding value for the variance increases/decreases the residual variance by 51% and 36%  respectively  because the model is multiplicative and can be shown to be []: where  is the residual variance prior to selection   is the residual variance after selection and  is the genetic gain on the underlying log scale of the variance. Hence  the genetic standard deviation of residual variance is an informative measure for two reasons: (1) it gives an idea of how large the proportional change in the residual variance would be for a unit standard deviation increase/decrease of the residual variance breeding values and (2) this proportional change does not depend on the phenotypic variance and can therefore be compared across experiments and species. The value of using the genetic standard deviation of residual variance was emphasized already in Mulder et al. [] where they refer to it as the genetic coefficient of variation. An alternative would be to use the Mulder-Hill heritability for the residual variance  i.e. the regression of the variance breeding values on squared phenotype values []  but this measure is model-specific and not as easy to interpret. Common environmental effects were not included in the variance sub-models. The main reason for this is that genetic and common environmental effects are difficult to disentangle  and more so with respect to the variance model  since there is only one variance group per family. In contrast  data with repeated records per individual will have one variance group per animal rather than one per family. In our case  the data structure makes the separation between genetic and common environment factors on the variance scale difficult  which was confirmed in the simulation study described above  where the DHGLM2 model was extended with a common environmental family effect in the variance sub-model. Although all the simulated heterogeneity of variance was due to genetics  the model distributed the dispersion effects more or less randomly over genetic and common environmental factors (varying between replicates). This confirms the low power of separating such effects in the variance model  despite a perfect mating system of 2 sires<U+2009>×<U+2009>2 dams. Furthermore  a preliminary analysis of the real data also revealed that partitioning additive genetic and common environmental effects in the variance model was sensitive to transformation of data  while the mean model was rather robust in this regard. Judging by the results of the linear animal mean model  the common environmental effects were small and not very significant (likelihood ratio test  P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05  results not shown). Still  we cannot rule out the existence of common environmental effects acting on the variance  and if they exist  the estimated genetic variance of the variance sub-model is probably inflated. It may be argued that heterogeneity of within-family variances may  to some extent  be explained by simple scaling effects  i.e.  variance may be a function of the expected mean. If this is the case  larger genetic and environmental variances should be expected for families with higher mean body weight. Yang et al. [] studied the effect of (Box-Cox) transformation of the data to stabilize variances. In one dataset (rabbits)  evidence for genetic heterogeneity was weaker after transformation  while the opposite was true for other datasets (pigs). Based on the moderately positive correlation between estimated parental breeding values from the mean and variance models for untransformed data (DHGLM2) of the current dataset  scaling effects may explain some of the genetic heterogeneity of within-family variance. The phenotypic data was therefore also log-transformed to remove a potential relationship between mean and variance. This reduced but did not remove heterogeneity of within-family variances (Table ). Both log and untransformed data are extremes of the Box-Cox transformation (corresponding to <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>1  respectively). Therefore  an intermediate transformation (square root  equivalent to <U+03BB><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5) was also tested but gave similar results to those of the log-transformation (Table ). Hence  our results indicate substantial heterogeneity of (within-family) variance for body weight in Atlantic salmon  apart from what is expected from simple scaling effects. The results of this study indicate that there is genetic heterogeneity of (within-family) variance for body weight in Atlantic salmon. Selection for decreased within-family variance may give more homogeneous stocks  which would be an advantage in commercial fish farming. Increased homogeneity is consistent with the concept of canalization  but according to theory  canalization may be due to varying sensitivity to both environmental and genetic perturbations  i.e.  the Mendelian sampling variance may also differ between families. Our study does not prove the presence of heterogeneity of Mendelian sampling variance  nor does it rule out the potential existence of such effects. A complication for selection for increased homogeneity based on cross-sectional data  which is by far the most common data structure in aquaculture  is that the Mendelian sampling and micro-environmental residual effects are completely confounded  which implies that pure selection against micro-environmental sensitivity cannot be guaranteed. Genetic heterogeneity in sensitivity to micro-environmental change (on the individual scale) is one form of genotype by environment interaction. However  genotype by environment interactions may also be present on the macro-environmental scale (diet  climatic region  etc.)  potentially causing re-ranking among families. For example  some families may have highly variable phenotypes for one diet but more homogeneous phenotypes for another diet. Hence  one may expect substantial re-ranking of estimated breeding values for variance among cohorts. Such factors would complicate meaningful selection for altered environmental sensitivity in practical breeding programs aimed at providing genetic material for production systems over a wide range of macro-environments. Substantial heterogeneity of within-family variance was found for body weight in Atlantic salmon  with a 95% prediction interval for within-family variance ranging from ~0.4 to ~1.2 kg  showing that the variation of the most extreme high families is approximately three times larger than the extreme low families. A tendency towards higher variance with higher means (scaling effects) was observed  but heterogeneity of within-family variance existed beyond what could be explained by simple scaling effects. Since there were no repeated observations  the fitting algorithm biased the estimates of the variance components of the DHGLM animal mean model (DHGLM1)  but not of a classical linear mean animal model and a pure sire-dam DHGLM (DHGLM2) model. However  selection for increased homogeneity of variance may still prove difficult  especially when based on cross-sectional data. Furthermore  potential macro-environmental changes may make genetic heterogeneity of variance a less stable trait over time and space.

However  this methodological change would generate additional costs. The objective of this study was to determine whether additional expenditures would be more profitably devoted to implementing genomic evaluations or to increasing phenotyping capacity while retaining traditional evaluations.MethodsStochastic simulation was used to simulate a population with 1050 breeding females and 50 boars that was selected for 10 years for a breeding goal with two uncorrelated traits with heritabilities of 0.4. The reference breeding scheme was based on phenotyping 13 770 candidates per year for trait 1 and 270 sibs of candidates per year for trait 2  with selection based on pedigree-based BLUP estimated breeding values. Increased expenditures were allocated to either increasing the phenotyping capacity for trait 2 while maintaining traditional evaluations  or to implementing genomic selection. The genomic scheme was based on two training populations: one for trait 2  consisting of phenotyped sibs of the candidates whose number increased from 1000 to 3430 over time  and one for trait 1  consisting of the selection candidates. Several genomic scenarios were tested  where the size of the training population for trait 1  and the number of genotyped candidates pre-selected based on their parental estimated breeding value  varied.ResultsBoth approaches resulted in higher genetic trends for the population breeding goal and lower rates of inbreeding compared to the reference scheme. However  even a very marked increase in phenotyping capacity for trait 2 could not match improvements achieved with genomic selection when the number of genotyped candidates was large.

However  this methodological change would generate additional costs. The objective of this study was to determine whether additional expenditures would be more profitably devoted to implementing genomic evaluations or to increasing phenotyping capacity while retaining traditional evaluations. Stochastic simulation was used to simulate a population with 1050 breeding females and 50 boars that was selected for 10 years for a breeding goal with two uncorrelated traits with heritabilities of 0.4. The reference breeding scheme was based on phenotyping 13 770 candidates per year for trait 1 and 270 sibs of candidates per year for trait 2  with selection based on pedigree-based BLUP estimated breeding values. Increased expenditures were allocated to either increasing the phenotyping capacity for trait 2 while maintaining traditional evaluations  or to implementing genomic selection. The genomic scheme was based on two training populations: one for trait 2  consisting of phenotyped sibs of the candidates whose number increased from 1000 to 3430 over time  and one for trait 1  consisting of the selection candidates. Several genomic scenarios were tested  where the size of the training population for trait 1  and the number of genotyped candidates pre-selected based on their parental estimated breeding value  varied. Both approaches resulted in higher genetic trends for the population breeding goal and lower rates of inbreeding compared to the reference scheme. However  even a very marked increase in phenotyping capacity for trait 2 could not match improvements achieved with genomic selection when the number of genotyped candidates was large. Genotyping just a limited number of pre-selected candidates significantly reduced the extra costs  while preserving most of the benefits in terms of genetic trends and inbreeding. Implementing genomic evaluations was the most efficient approach when major expenditure was possible  whereas increasing phenotypes was preferable when limited resources were available. Economic decisions on implementing genomic evaluations in a pig nucleus population must take account of population characteristics  phenotyping and genotyping costs  and available funds. In recent years  genomic selection (GS) [] has been implemented with success in dairy cattle []  which has made it possible to stop lengthy and costly progeny testing in this species. Compared with traditional selection schemes  GS in dairy cattle enables earlier selection from a larger number of candidates  while maintaining (for males) or even increasing (for females) the accuracy of their estimated breeding values (EBV). The resulting shorter generation intervals and higher selection intensities are expected to result in markedly higher annual genetic trends (e.g. []). Moreover  the savings achieved from not rearing non-productive males while awaiting the phenotype of their daughters under the progeny testing system provides the funds for genotyping. Consequently  switching from traditional to more efficient genomic schemes has not generated much  if any  additional costs in dairy cattle. In pigs  with the availability of the porcineSNP60 Illumina beadchip (Illumina  Inc.  San Diego  CA) and the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) observed in the nucleus populations [  ]  it is now possible to consider the implementation of GS. Current pig breeding schemes are  however  already characterized by high selection intensities and very short generation intervals. The impact of GS on these two parameters is therefore expected to be small  in contrast to the situation in dairy cattle. The accuracy of EBV is  nevertheless  generally poor in pigs  especially for late-recorded sex-limited traits and traits that cannot be measured on candidates (e.g. meat quality) or that are too expensive to measure on a large number of animals (e.g. feed efficiency). In this context  genomic evaluations can produce more accurate EBV than the current pedigree-based BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction)-animal model (pBLUP) evaluations and increase the efficiency of breeding schemes  as reported by Lillehammer et al. [] in dam lines for traits that are only recorded on females. For sire lines  Tribout et al. [] estimated that replacing pBLUP evaluations by genomic evaluations in a breeding scheme based on the combined phenotyping of candidates and a limited number of sibs of the candidates could increase the annual genetic trend for the population breeding goal by approximately 30% through greater accuracy  while substantially reducing the rate of inbreeding. Most current pig breeding schemes are based on on-farm phenotyping of candidates for a few  easy to record growth and fattening traits  and on phenotyping of a limited number of sibs or candidates in testing stations for traits that are expensive or difficult to measure. Unlike in dairy cattle  GS in pigs would not result in organisational changes to the schemes that could generate sufficient savings to compensate for the cost of genotyping. First  selection among candidates usually occurs at the end of the fattening period (at about 160 days of age)  which means that there is currently no financial cost associated with maintaining selection candidates during an unproductive period of time  as opposed to a breeding scheme based on progeny testing. Moreover  even if genomic evaluations no longer require candidates to be tested on-farm  the current phenotyping of candidates (mostly weighing and ultrasonic depth measurements) is much less expensive than genotyping. Finally  phenotyping of animals in testing stations for traits that are expensive or difficult to measure would still be necessary in genomic schemes in order to constitute and update the training population (TP) for these traits. Therefore  implementation of genomic evaluations would necessarily result in additional costs for pig schemes and comparing the efficiency  in terms of selection accuracy  genetic trends and inbreeding rates  of a traditional breeding scheme based on pBLUP genetic evaluation with that of a more expensive genomic breeding scheme would be clearly unfair. Thus  it is legitimate to question whether it might not be more profitable to invest in improvements in the efficiency of current schemes rather than in the implementation of genomic evaluation. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency – in terms of annual genetic trends and annual increases in inbreeding – of a traditional pig sire line breeding scheme based on pBLUP genetic evaluation and the combined phenotyping of candidates and their sibs  with that of a genomic breeding scheme involving the same overall cost. The main weakness of the traditional pig breeding scheme considered here is the limited number of sibs that are phenotyped per year  resulting in poor accuracy of EBV for traits that are not directly measured on the selection candidates. Thus  as a first step  we evaluated the benefits of gradually increasing the annual number of phenotyped sibs under a pBLUP scheme. The additional cost of a genomic scheme depends directly on the number of genotyped animals. Thus  in a second step  we estimated the efficiency of GS designs for different numbers of genotyped candidates. Finally  increases in the capacity to phenotype sibs and the different numbers of genotyped candidates were converted into extra annual costs compared to a reference situation that was assumed to be representative of a current standard pig sire line breeding scheme  in order to determine the most profitable investment from a genetic point of view. No ethical approval was required for this study because no animals were used. To compare the efficiency of different breeding schemes  we carried out a stochastic simulation of a purebred paternal pig population consisting of 1050 breeding females distributed across five herds of equal size  and 50 breeding males. The population was selected for a global breeding goal that included two genetically independent traits with an initial heritability of 0.4 and an initial genetic variance of 1  based on either traditional pBLUP EBV or genomic EBV (hereinafter referred to as PEBV and GEBV  respectively). Trait 1 was representative of a fattening trait that is inexpensive and easy to measure on-farm  and was recorded on a large number of candidates  whereas trait 2 was representative of a trait that is too difficult or too expensive to measure on a large scale (e.g. feed efficiency) or even that can not be measured on candidates (e.g. carcass composition or meat quality) and was therefore recorded on a limited number of sibs of the selection candidates. Two series of simulations were performed  considering two alternative sets of economic values in the breeding goal  i.e. W1:1 and W1:3. For W1:1  the breeding goal was   whereas for W1:3  the breeding goal was   where  and  are the true breeding values for traits 1 and 2  respectively. For both W1:1 and W1:3  the initial genetic variance of the breeding goal was equal to 1. In the following  these same economic weights were applied to the PEBV of animal i for traits 1 and 2 ( and   respectively) or to its GEBV for traits 1 and 2 ( and   respectively) to compute its EBV for the breeding goal in the pBLUP () and genomic () selection schemes. The procedures used to simulate the genome are detailed in []. The simulated genome consisted of 10 pairs of 100 cM chromosomes  each chromosome carrying 1500 neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers  90 biallelic randomly positioned quantitative trait loci (QTL) for trait 1  and 90 biallelic randomly positioned QTL for trait 2. All markers and QTL had a minor allele frequency higher than 0.05. The SNPs were unevenly spaced  with an average distance between two consecutive SNPs of 67 kb. Short- and long-range LD in the simulated population was comparable to the LD actually observed in the major French pig nucleus populations. By convention  allele 1 of each QTL had no effect and the absolute values of the effect of QTL allele 2 were sampled from a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters equal to 0.4 and 1/1.66 []  and given a positive or negative sign with probability 0.5. For both traits  the effects of the QTL were rescaled to result in a genetic variance of 1 in the breeding population when selection started. The true breeding value of animal  for trait  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 or 2) was calculated as:   where  is the genotype (i.e. 0  1 or 2 copies of allele 2) of animal  for the  QTL for trait t on chromosome   and  is the effect of the  QTL for trait  on chromosome . A total of 100 independent replicates were performed for each of the scenarios considered. For each replicate  a new genome was simulated and 1050 base females were randomly assigned to five herds of equal size  and within each herd into seven batches of 30 females. The time step (TS) was three weeks  which corresponded to the period between the farrowing of females from two consecutive batches. Therefore  a sow farrowed every 7 TS until culling. For simplicity  we considered that 18 TS (i.e. 378 days) corresponded to one year of simulation. The population was first selected and bred for five years (i.e. 90 TS) under a pBLUP scenario that was designed to be representative of a traditional pig sire line breeding scheme  called BL_ref hereinafter. After this boot period  selection continued for 10 more years (i.e. 180 TS)  under either the same BL_ref or according to four other pBLUP scenarios with greater capacity to phenotype sibs for trait 2  or under five genomic scenarios that differed in the annual number of candidates genotyped and the size of the TP for trait 1. The results of these alternative scenarios were compared over this 10-year period. The characteristics of the ten scenarios that were considered are summarized in Table  and presented in Figure . The numbers of boars and sows and the numbers of candidates selected per TS to replace the breeding animals was the same for each scenario.   pLF<U+2009>=<U+2009>proportion of litters containing three female candidates; pLM<U+2009>=<U+2009>proportion of litters containing three male candidates; pLS<U+2009>=<U+2009>proportion of litters with a sib phenotyped for trait 2 (see Table  for the corresponding values in the simulated scenarios). The BL_ref scenario is identical to the so-called “BLUP-AM” scenario described in [] and was modelled based on the average statistics of the French Piétrain nucleus population that were obtained from the data used for national genetic evaluations. Briefly  27 and 24 litters of the 30 litters born in each batch and on each herd (i.e. 90% and 80% of the born litters  respectively) contained three female and three male selection candidates  respectively. A phenotype for trait 1 was simulated for each candidate. A total of 15 litters per batch across the five herds (representing 10% of the born litters) also had one piglet that was phenotyped for trait 2 (these animals will be referred to as the “phenotyped sibs” in the following). These 15 litters were chosen among those containing candidates  by selecting the best litters as a function of their parental PEBV for the population breeding goal  giving priority to litters of boars with the fewest offspring among the already chosen phenotyped sibs and balancing the number of litters chosen from each herd. At each TS  the PEBV were estimated independently for the two traits  using a standard BLUP-Animal Model procedure [] and the BLUPF90 software ()  considering all phenotypes and pedigrees recorded since the creation of the herds. At each TS  the best 10 of the 81 female candidates from each herd and the 9 best of the 360 male candidates from across the five herds were selected based on PEBV to partially replace the pool of male and female reproducers. The main weakness of the BL_ref scheme lies in the limited number of sibs that are phenotyped for trait 2 (one animal in 10% of the litters)  resulting in low accuracies of PEBV for candidates for this trait. Therefore  increasing the phenotyping capacity for trait 2 is expected to improve the efficiency of the traditional scheme. To evaluate this improvement  the BL_ref scenario was modified by increasing from the 90 TS (that will be referred to as TS90 in the following) the proportion of litters with a phenotyped sib to 30%  50%  70% or 90% in the alternative BL_30%  BL_50%  BL_70% and BL_90% scenarios  respectively. Similar to the BL_ref scenario  the litters were chosen based on parental PEBV for the population breeding goal  giving priority to the litters of boars with the fewest offspring among the already chosen phenotyped sibs and balancing the number of litters chosen from each herd. BL_90% corresponded to the case where all litters that had female candidates (i.e. 90% of the born litters) also had one sib that was phenotyped for trait 2 (i.e. no litter selection). The GE_ref scenario differed from the BL_ref scenario only by the procedure used to estimate breeding values; the numbers of male and female candidates  phenotyped sibs  selected candidates and breeding males and females were the same. This scenario was similar to the “GE-2TP” scenario detailed in []. Starting in TS90  all candidates  phenotyped sibs and breeding animals of the GE_ref scenario were genotyped  and all selection and culling decisions were based on   which were estimated as follows. At TS90  the effects of all SNPs on traits 1 and 2 were estimated using the BLUP methodology described in [] on two distinct TP  one for each trait. The initial TP for trait 2 (TP2) consisted of 1000 phenotyped sibs of the candidates born between TS16 and TS82  that were genotyped and phenotyped for trait 2. For trait 1  the initial TP (TP1) consisted in 13 770 male and female candidates that were genotyped and phenotyped for this trait during the 5 year of the simulation (TS73 to TS90). From a practical point of view  the genome simulated in this study was approximately three times shorter than the real pig genome (10 M instead of 30 M). Therefore  TP1 and TP2 were simulated by randomly sampling one third of the candidates and phenotyped sibs at each TS  as described and illustrated in []  in order to produce GEBV with appropriate accuracies []. Thus  the initial TP1 and TP2 contained 4590 and 333 simulated animals  respectively  equivalent to 13 770 or 1000 animals  respectively  for a full genome. The estimated SNP effects were used in the current TS and during the next 17 TS (i.e. 1 year) to calculate the GEBV of the breeding animals and candidates for trait  as   where  is the estimated effect of the  SNP on chromosome  for trait . Then   and  were combined based on their economic weights to calculate . Each year  the effects of the SNPs on the two traits were re-estimated using a TP that was increased by data from the 270 new phenotyped sibs and the 13 770 new candidates that were phenotyped in the past year (in fact  90 and 4590 randomly sampled additional animals  respectively  to account for the size of the simulated genome)  and these new estimates were then used to calculate the  of breeding animals and candidates for the current and next 17 TS. Thus  the size of TP2 increased from 1000 to 3430 animals from the 6 to the 15 year of simulation. To limit computation time  the pigs of the oldest year were removed from TP1 every year  starting in year 10. Thus  the size of TP1 increased from 13 770 animals at year 6 to 55 080 at year 9  and then remained stable. Preliminary results had shown that the loss in accuracy for trait 1 due to removal of the oldest animals from TP1 was very low (approximately 1% in year 10). Under the GE_ref scenario  the number of candidates that were genotyped per year from year 5 to year 15 was identical to the annual number of candidates in the BL_ref scheme (13 770 animals/year). The extra cost due to genotyping was therefore considerable in the GE_ref scenario. A reduction in the annual number of genotyped candidates would reduce this cost but also cause a loss of technical efficiency of the GS scheme because of the resulting decreases in selection intensities  size of TP1 and accuracies of GEBV for trait 1. To evaluate this loss  four genomic schemes were derived from the GE_ref scenario. Under these schemes  the initial size of TP1 (at TS90) and the number of candidates genotyped per batch from the 6 year of simulation were reduced by approximately 20% (GE_80% scheme)  40% (GE_60%)  60% (GE_40%) and 80% (GE_20%)  as described below: 1) Instead of all candidates from the 18 TS of the 5 year under the GE_ref scenario  the initial TP1 under the GE_80%  GE_60%  GE_40% and GE_20% scenarios included male and female candidates that were phenotyped in the last 14  11  7 and 4 TS of year 5  respectively; 2) The numbers of litters  per herd and TS  with three male and three female candidates that were phenotyped and genotyped (nLM<U+2009>=<U+2009>24 and nLF<U+2009>=<U+2009>27 litters under the GE_ref scenario  respectively) were reduced to 19 and 22 litters for GE_80%  to 14 and 16 litters for GE_60%  to 10 and 11 litters for GE_40%  and to 5 and 5 litters for GE_20%. At each TS  these litters were chosen in each herd from among the 27 litters available by selecting the best ones based on parental EBV for the breeding goal. One hundred independent replicates of five years of selection under the BL_ref scenario  followed by 10 years of selection under each of the 10 alternative scenarios  were simulated for the W1:1 and W1:3 breeding goals. For each replicate of each breeding scenario x breeding goal combination  the following summary statistics were calculated: the mean of the true breeding values of the piglets born in each TS for traits 1 and 2 and for the breeding goal  in order to measure the realized genetic gain; the mean of the inbreeding coefficients of the piglets born in each TS based on pedigree information using PEDIG software []  to measure the evolution of inbreeding over time; the correlation between the TBV and the PEBV or GEBV of the selection candidates for each TS  in order to estimate accuracies of the selection for traits 1 and 2. The above statistics were then used to derive the average annual realized genetic gains (<U+0394>Ga)  the average annual increase in inbreeding (<U+0394>Fa)  and the average accuracies from year 6 to year 15 for each replicate and averaged over the 100 replicates for each breeding scenario x breeding goal combination. To be able to compare the relative efficiencies of the genomic and pBLUP simulated schemes at constant cost  we evaluated the extra cost of the nine alternative schemes compared to the BL_ref reference scenario  as follows. We assumed that the increase in the number of phenotyped sibs would generate extra costs linked to the building of additional testing station facilities and the raising and phenotyping of animals. Based on the range of costs observed in testing stations in France and other countries (IFIP  French Pork and Pig Institute survey in 2005  personal communication)  and assuming amortization of buildings and equipment over a 10-year period  a low (€150)  medium (€350) and high (€550) cost per extra sib phenotyped for trait 2 were considered. The annual extra costs of the alternative pBLUP schemes  compared to the BL_ref scheme  were therefore calculated by multiplying the annual numbers of additional phenotyped sibs (540  1080  1620 and 2160 animals for BL_30%  BL_50%  BL_70% and BL_90%  respectively) by the individual additional cost under the low  medium and high cost hypotheses. Implementation of genomic selection requires genotyping of the initial TP1 and TP2  and continuous genotyping of new candidates and phenotyped sibs. To evaluate the resulting extra costs  we considered that boars and sows used for breeding were genotyped with the porcine60SNP beadchip but that selection candidates and phenotyped sibs were genotyped with a lower density and less expensive beadchip. Indeed  several studies [–] have shown that it is possible to impute the genotypes of young animals for the missing SNPs with a very low error rate when both parents are genotyped with the denser beadchip. Three hypotheses were considered to take uncertainties regarding the future evolution of genotyping costs into account: the genotyping costs considered for the high density (HDpr) and the low density (LDpr) chips were €150/animal and €50/animal  respectively  under the high price hypothesis  €120 and €30 under the medium price hypothesis  and €90 and €10 under the low price hypothesis. The numbers of animals in the initial TP1 (S1) under the five genomic scenarios considered are in Table . The sires and dams of these animals were genotyped with the denser chip to increase the imputation accuracy; for simplicity  we considered a constant number of parents regardless of the genomic scenario  equal to the annual number of new breeding animals (900 gilts and 162 boars). The S2 (i.e. 1000) phenotyped sibs that constitute the initial TP2 were assumed to be genotyped with the high density chip rather than imputed. The genotyping costs for the initial TP1 and TP2 were therefore calculated as GCini<U+2009>=<U+2009>S1*LDpr<U+2009>+<U+2009>(S2<U+2009>+<U+2009>900<U+2009>+<U+2009>162)*HDpr. Similar to the amortization of additional testing station capacity under the pBLUP scenarios  these initial genotyping costs were spread over a 10-year period. In addition  nFC female candidates  nMC male candidates and nPS phenotyped sibs were genotyped every year for the low density chip  and the 900 female candidates and the 162 male candidates selected each year as breeding animals were re-genotyped with the denser chip to enable high density imputation of their future offspring. Thus  the annual extra cost of any of a genomic scheme was calculated as: Overall  the GE_ref breeding scheme produced higher genetic gains than the BL_ref breeding scheme. When the population was selected for the W1:1 breeding goal  GE_ref resulted in 11%  83% and 28% higher <U+0394>Ga than BL_ref for trait 1  trait 2 and the breeding goal  respectively (Table ). This superiority was due to more accurate EBV in the genomic scheme (Table ). Whereas the accuracy of the PEBV of candidates was equal to only 0.62 for trait 1 and 0.33 for trait 2 on average over the considered period  the average accuracy of the GEBV increased from approximately 0.76 (year 6) to 0.85 (year 9) for trait 1  and from 0.45 (year 6) to 0.55 (year 15) for trait 2  as the sizes of TP1 and TP2 increased (results not shown). On average  over the 10-year comparison  the accuracy of the GEBV was 0.83 and 0.52 for traits 1 and 2  respectively  i.e. 34% and 58% higher than the accuracy of the PEBV. The superiority of GE_ref over BL_ref in terms of <U+0394>Ga was much greater for trait 2 than for trait 1 because the increase in accuracy was greater for trait 2 than for trait 1. This indirectly reinforced the relative importance of trait 2 compared to trait 1 in the selection index. When the population was selected for the W1:3 breeding goal  GE_ref also resulted in markedly higher <U+0394>Ga than BL_ref for trait 2 and for the breeding goal (64% and 41%  respectively)  but produced a slightly lower <U+0394>Ga for trait 1 than the traditional scheme (-5%)  despite the fact that the GEBV were more accurate than the PEBV for both traits. This result was due to the greater weighting of trait 2 in the W1:3 breeding goal than in the W1:1 breeding goal. Indeed  the larger weight on trait 2 in the W1:3 breeding goal counterbalanced its lower accuracy compared to that of trait 1 in the BL_ref scenario. Therefore  the selection pressure on the two traits was more balanced for W1:3 than for W1:1  for which the selection pressure was mainly on trait 1. Because of the greater increase in accuracy for trait 2 than for trait 1 (+68% vs. +30%) when switching from BL_ref to GE_ref  the selection pressure on trait 2 in the W1:3 selection index  which was already large in BL_ref  was further increased in GE_ref. Because of the high selection pressure on trait 2  a small loss of selection response was observed for trait 1. The accuracy of the PEBV of candidates for trait 2 improved significantly when the proportion of litters with one sib phenotyped for trait 2 increased (Table ). Phenotyping one sib in 90% rather that in 10% of the litters resulted in an increase in the accuracy of the PEBV by on average 45%: 0.48 for BL_90% and 0.33 for BL_ref  for the W1:1 breeding goal. This improvement in accuracy for trait 2 was due to the larger number of half-sibs phenotyped for this trait per candidate  as well as the higher proportion of candidates that benefited from having one full-sib phenotyped. However  the average accuracy for trait 2 was lower for all pBLUP scenarios than for GE_ref. This greater accuracy for trait 2 from increasing the number of phenotyped sibs in the pBLUP schemes improved the genetic gains for this trait (Table ) markedly. For example  testing one phenotyped sib in 50% instead of 10% of the litters resulted in a 71% greater <U+0394>Ga (+0.32s/yr vs. +0.18s/yr) with selection for the W1:1 breeding goal. In the extreme case of BL_90%  the average annual genetic trend for trait 2 (+0.50s/yr) almost equalled that of the GE_ref with the W1:3 breeding goal  and even slightly exceeded (+0.36s/yr) that of GE_ref with the W1:1 breeding goal. As expected  accuracy of PEBV for trait 1 was the same for all pBLUP scenarios  since the number of phenotyped candidates was kept constant and the sibs were not phenotyped for trait 1. Nevertheless  it should be noted that the <U+0394>Ga for trait 1 declined with an increase in the number of sibs phenotyped for trait 2 because of the increasing selection pressure on trait 2  resulting from the increasing accuracy for trait 2. Logically  this unfavourable impact on trait 1 was greater when the population was selected for a breeding goal that placed more emphasis on trait 2. However  the genetic gain for trait 1 remained positive in all the cases. Overall  increasing the number of phenotyped sibs significantly improved the efficiency of the pBLUP breeding scheme in terms of response in the breeding goal. The extreme BL_90% scenario  in which one animal from every litter suitable for genetic purposes was tested in station  led to a 14% increase in the <U+0394>Ga in the breeding goal with selection on W1:1  and a 35% increase with selection on W1:3. However  even in this very favourable case  the pBLUP scenario had 11% and 5% less response in the breeding goal than the GE_ref scheme with selection on W1:1 and W1:3  respectively. Compared to GE_ref  reducing the initial size of TP1 and thereafter the number of litters containing genotyped candidates resulted in a lower <U+0394>Ga for trait 1 (Table ). The loss of <U+0394>Ga for trait 1 was minor with small reductions in genotyping (approximately -3% and -7% compared to GE_ref for GE_80% and GE_60%  respectively) but was more marked with greater reductions in genotyping (-12% and -14% for GE_40%  and -24% and -29% for GE_20% compared to GE_ref for W1:1 and W1:3  respectively). The origins of these losses were twofold. First  reducing the number of genotyped candidates reduced the initial size and growth of TP1 and  therefore  reduced the accuracy of the GEBV for trait 1 (Table ). However  the reduction in the accuracy of the GEBV for trait 1 was only moderate. For example  the average accuracy over the 10-year period for W1:1 was only 5.5% lower for GE_60% than for GE_ref  despite a 40% reduction in the size of TP1  and only 9.4% lower for GE40% than for GE_ref  despite a 60% reduction in the size of TP1  and remained greater than for the pBLUP schemes. The second cause for the reduction in <U+0394>Ga for trait 1 was a decrease in selection intensity  since a fixed number of young animals (10 females per TS in each herd  and nine males per TS) were selected from a smaller number of candidates. The size and structure of TP2 was the same for the five genomic scenarios. Consequently  the accuracy of GEBV for trait 2 remained unchanged (Table ). Thus  the decline in accuracy for trait 1 from GE_ref to GE_20% resulted indirectly in an increase in the selection emphasis on trait 2 in the selection index. This counterbalanced the negative effects of the lower selection intensity due to the smaller number of candidates on response for trait 2. Thus  <U+0394>Ga for trait 2 was not (for the W1:1 breeding goal) or only slightly (-6% from GE_ref to GE_20% for the W1:3 breeding goal) impacted by the reduction in the number of candidates (Table ). As a consequence of the impact on responses for traits 1 and 2  the efficiency of the genomic breeding scheme in improving the breeding goal was only moderately affected by the number of litters with candidates  and remained much greater than for BL_ref in all cases (Table ). Reducing the initial size of TP1 and the number of litters with candidates by 40% and 80% only reduced the <U+0394>Ga for the breeding goal by 4% and 16%  respectively  compared to the GE_ref scenario  when the population was selected for the W1:1 breeding goal. This loss in efficiency was even less marked when a greater weight was given to trait 2 in the breeding goal (-3% and -11%  respectively  for GE_60% and GE_20% compared to GE_ref). The <U+0394>Ga for the breeding goal (<U+0394>Ga_bg) produced under the five pBLUP and five genomic schemes  as a function of their additional annual costs compared to the BL_ref scheme  are plotted in Figure a and b for the W1:1 and W1:3 breeding goals  respectively. These comparisons were made under the three hypotheses for the cost of genotyping and under the three hypotheses for the cost of phenotyping additional sibs. Interpolations were performed to estimate the <U+0394>Ga_bg for numbers of litters with one phenotyped sib and for genotyping reductions that were intermediate to those simulated. The lower bound for the three pBLUP scenarios corresponded to the BL_ref scheme (no additional cost)  whereas the upper bound corresponded to the BL_90% scheme  which was the most expensive and most efficient scenario in terms of <U+0394>Ga_bg. Similarly  the lower bound for the three genomic schemes was observed for the least expensive and least efficient scenario (GE_20%)  whereas the upper bound corresponded to the most expensive and most efficient scenario (GE_ref).  The results are averages of the 100 replicates;  Breeding goal =  Breeding Value for trait 1 +  Breeding Value for trait 2  or  Breeding Value for trait 1 +  Breeding Value for trait 2 ;  three levels of genotyping and phenotyping costs were considered: GE_LowGC  GE_MedGC and GE_HighGC<U+2009>=<U+2009>genomic breeding scheme under low  medium and high genotyping costs hypothesis  respectively; BL_LowTC  BL_MedTC and BL_HighTC<U+2009>=<U+2009>pBLUP breeding scheme under low  medium and high testing station costs hypothesis  respectively. When ignoring the extra costs  the genomic breeding schemes yielded markedly higher <U+0394>Ga_bg than the most efficient pBLUP scheme (BL_90%) when candidates from at least 30% (for W1:1) or at least 40% (for W1:3) of the best litters with candidates in the reference scheme were genotyped. The potential extra gain in <U+0394>Ga_bg between the best genomic scheme (GE_ref) and the best pBLUP scheme (BL_90%) was  however  greater for the W1:1 breeding goal (<U+0394>Ga<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.73s/yr vs. 0.65s/yr  i.e. an increase of 12%) than for the W1:3 breeding goal (<U+0394>Ga<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.61s/yr vs. 0.58s/yr  i.e. an increase of 5%). Conversely  the traditional schemes always resulted in lower <U+0394>Ga_bg than the least efficient genomic scheme (GE_20%) when fewer than 30% (in the W1:1 case) or 50% (in the W1:3 case) of the litters had a sib phenotyped for trait 2. Implementing the cheapest possible genomic scheme considered in this study (GE_20%) obviously involved a minimum extra annual cost  depending on the cost of genotyping an individual. For example  under the medium genotyping cost hypothesis  this minimum investment amounted to €250 000 per year. Below this threshold for annual additional expenses  the only possibility to improve the efficiency of the breeding programme would be to increase the number of phenotyped sibs. Comparing the respective <U+0394>Ga_bg resulting from the pBLUP scheme and from the genomic scheme that could be implemented at a given extra cost  revealed two areas where the most efficient of the two strategies differed. Below a certain threshold for extra annual costs  <U+0394>Ga_bg was greater for the improved pBLUP scheme than for the genomic scheme  and above this threshold  the genomic scheme was more efficient. The value of this threshold for each combination of genotyping costs and costs of phenotyping an additional sib is presented in Table . Table  shows that  for a given cost of phenotyping an additional sib  this threshold increased with the genotyping cost. Conversely  for a given genotyping cost  the threshold decreased as the phenotyping cost of sibs increased. To illustrate this  for W1:1  an extra annual cost of €260 000 was more effective if used to implement a genomic breeding scheme than to improve the efficiency of the pBLUP scheme when the genotyping costs were low (regardless of the phenotyping cost of sibs)  or when genotyping costs were medium and phenotyping costs of sibs were high. In all other cases  these extra funds would be more efficiently used to increase the number of phenotyped sibs in the traditional scheme. Rates of inbreeding (<U+0394>Fa) observed in the 10 scenarios simulated for the two breeding goals are in Table . The GE_ref scheme resulted in a smaller increase in the average inbreeding coefficient of the population than the BL_ref scheme  for both W1:1 and W1:3 (Figure ). For GE_ref  following implementation of genomic evaluations  the rate of increase in inbreeding initially gradually declined  reflecting the progressive replacement of breeding animals selected based on PEBV until TS90 by males and females selected based on GEBV. Thereafter  the average population inbreeding rose at a steady rate that was similar for W1:1 and W1:3 but significantly lower than for BL_ref. Considering the complete 10-year period  <U+0394>Fa was on average 57% lower for GE_ref than for BL_ref when the population was selected based on the W1:1 breeding goal (+0.36% per year vs. +0.84% per year) and 68% lower for the W1:3 breeding goal (+0.51% per year vs. +1.58% per year).  Averages of the 100 replicates; simulated scenarios: BL_ref<U+2009>=<U+2009>breeding scheme based on traditional pBLUP genetic evaluations using phenotypes of the candidates for trait 1 and phenotypes of sibs for trait 2 sampled in 10% of the litters; GE_ref<U+2009>=<U+2009>breeding scheme based on genomic evaluations with annual numbers of candidates and phenotyped sibs identical to the BL_ref scenario; <U+2009>W1:1: Breeding goal =  Breeding Value for trait 1 +  Breeding Value for trait 2; W1:3: Breeding goal =  Breeding Value for trait 1 +  Breeding Value for trait 2. No significant relationship was found between the annual number of sibs phenotyped for trait 2 and <U+0394>Fa when the population was selected based on the W1:1 breeding goal. When greater weight was given to trait 2 in the breeding goal (W1:3)  increasing the proportion of litters with a sib recorded for trait 2 from 10 to 70% significantly reduced the annual increase in inbreeding by -17%. However  <U+0394>Fa tended to be 7% higher for BL_90% than for BL_70% (-value of the difference<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.053). Increasing restrictions on the number of litters with candidates logically resulted in selecting males and females that were more related to each other. This significantly accelerated the increase in inbreeding in the population. For example  the average inbreeding coefficient increased 8  28  55 and 111% faster for GE_80%  GE_60% GE_40% and GE_20%  respectively  than for GE_ref  when the population was selected based on the W1:1 breeding goal. However  the global increase in inbreeding over the 10-year period was smaller for all genomic schemes than for any of the pBLUP schemes. Moreover  the advantage of the genomic over the pBLUP schemes was even more pronounced when the relative weight of trait 2 in the breeding goal increased: <U+0394>Fa values were 10 and 36% lower for the least favourable genomic scenario (GE_20%) compared to the most favourable pBLUP scheme for W1:1 and W1:3  respectively. The results presented here were obtained by stochastic simulation of a selected population under several scenarios. Particular attention was paid to modelling a realistic pig population structure with overlapping generations  as well as a genome presenting appropriate linkage disequilibrium and adequate marker density. However  several assumptions and simplifications were necessary  as in any simulation study  mainly to ensure that computation time remained reasonable. For instance  management of inbreeding was not considered in the selection and mating procedures  while this is a major concern for pig breeders. This resulted in markedly higher inbreeding rates and probably stronger selection intensities than what is observed in practice. However  the same selection and mating procedures were applied to both the genomic and the pBLUP scenarios. One can therefore assume that the comparisons were relevant to assess the relative merits of the breeding schemes considered. Nevertheless  the economic results should not be considered as precise predictions but rather as orders of magnitude. For simplicity  only two unrelated traits were considered in the breeding goal. However  in practice  most traits recorded on phenotyped sibs and candidates are genetically correlated  meaning that measurements on one trait carry information on other traits. On the one hand  multiple-trait pBLUP genetic evaluations are routinely used in current pig breeding schemes to take advantage of this additional information  providing increased accuracies compared to single-trait PEBV. On the other hand  multiple-trait genomic evaluation models have been little explored and evaluated to date  although several models have been proposed. Calus and Veerkamp [] and Jia and Jannink [] showed by simulations that multiple-trait genomic evaluations can generate higher accuracies of GEBV than single-trait models. Similar to traditional pBLUP evaluations  greater improvements in accuracy were observed for low-heritable traits that are highly correlated with high-heritable traits. Moreover  according to []  using multiple-trait genomic evaluations would be particularly advantageous for traits for which the phenotype is not directly observed on candidates  like trait 2 in the present study. However  for such traits  the relative increase in accuracy generated by multiple-trait compared to single-trait models tended to be lower with genomic evaluations than with pBLUP evaluations []. This suggests that the superiority of the pig genomic breeding schemes over traditional breeding schemes could be somewhat lower than estimated here for independent traits when traits are correlated and multiple-trait evaluations are used. In addition  genomic selection generates greater genetic gain than pedigree-based genetic evaluations  and could therefore result in fixing favourable alleles of the QTL more rapidly. One can thus assume that genomic selection could change genetic correlations between traits more markedly than traditional selection  modifying the long-term efficiency of the breeding scheme. Several studies [–] have shown that the accuracy of genomic predictions may depend significantly on the number of QTL affecting the traits and on the distribution of their effects. It would therefore be interesting to test the sensitivity of our results by repeating our simulations with different genetic architectures. However  similar relative improvements in terms of average annual genetic trends were observed in [] for three different QTL densities (10 QTL/M  30 QTL/M and 60 QTL/M) when changing from BL_ref to GE_ref. Moreover  Daetwyler et al [] observed that the accuracy of the GEBV calculated with the GBLUP method  as in our study  seemed not to be affected by the number of QTL or by the distribution of QTL variance. These findings suggest that our results should be relatively conservative to the genetic architecture hypothesis  but further simulations are needed to confirm this. Our results tended to show that replacing traditional pBLUP genetic evaluations by genomic evaluations in a breeding scheme organized around the combined phenotyping of candidates and sibs could result in more improvement in terms of accuracy of EBV  annual genetic trends and inbreeding than increasing the number of sibs phenotyped for trait 2 while retaining traditional evaluations. This superiority of genomic selection in terms of annual response in the breeding goal was due to the fact that the accuracy of EBV increased significantly for both traits compared to the reference traditional scheme. By contrast  under the pBLUP scheme  increasing the number of phenotyped sibs only improved the accuracy of the EBV for trait 2. In the nucleus population simulated here  only six animals per litter (seven in litters that had a phenotyped sib) were used for genetic purposes  whereas the average number of weaned piglets per litter in the French Piétrain population that was modeled is approximately eight. Therefore  another way to further improve the efficiency of the pBLUP scheme would be to phenotype these unused animals for trait 1  resulting in a higher accuracy of the PEBV for that trait. However  each candidate in the pBLUP scenarios already had an own phenotype for trait 1  along with phenotypes on its two parents  five full-sibs  and several half-sibs. Therefore  the benefits of these additional animals on the accuracy and genetic gain for trait 1 would be very low  and this option was not considered here. We compared the accuracy of the pBLUP and genomic evaluations through the correlations between the TBV and the PEBV or GEBV of the evaluated animals. This criterion has emerged as the most commonly used metric to assess the prediction accuracy of a genetic evaluation method  since it has a linear relationship with response to selection. Another criterion to evaluate the merits of different breeding value prediction methods is their ability to produce unbiased estimates of true breeding values. Unbiasedness is a desirable property in genetic evaluation because it enables  in particular  a proper comparison of the genetic merit of animals present in different environments or times  and correct estimates of realized genetic trends. In simulations  unbiasedness of a given breeding value prediction method can be assessed by comparing the estimated and the true genetic trends in the simulated population over time  or by estimating the regression coefficient of true on estimated breeding values at each genetic evaluation time. Unfortunately  these criteria were not calculated in this study. The potential extra gain for the breeding goal produced by the most efficient genomic scheme (GE_ref) compared to the most efficient pBLUP breeding scheme (BL_90%) depended on the relative economic weights of the traits in the breeding goal. When the trait recorded on candidates and the trait recorded only on sibs had comparable economic weights (W1:1)  the potential extra gain of a genomic scheme was considerable  since it improved selection for both traits. By contrast  when a large proportion of the breeding goal concerns the trait recorded on phenotyped sibs (as in the W1:3 case)  improving accuracy for the trait recorded on candidates was less crucial  and the potential extra gain of a genomic scheme over a traditional scheme was less. The accuracy of a candidate’s PEBV depends mainly on the availability of an own phenotype and on the number of its closest relatives that have a phenotype. In this study  this number was on average fixed over time for a given pBLUP scenario  as was the corresponding average accuracy of PEBV. In contrast  the accuracy of GEBV increased with the size of the TP. Thus  it could be assumed  if the simulation had been run for more years and if TP1 had grown continuously instead of being limited to candidates from the last four years after year 10 (for computation reasons)  that the accuracy of GEBV for both traits would have tended to increase steadily until the oldest animals in the TP had become uninformative. The superiority of the GE_ref over the BL_ref scheme would therefore have increased further over time. Furthermore  in the simulations  the TP and SNP effects were only updated once a year in order to limit computation time. As a result  the accuracy of the GEBV of candidates  and therefore the selection efficiency in the 17 batches between two updates were lower than if the SNP effects had been re-estimated each TS using TP that would have been continuously updated with animals that are closely related to the candidates (e.g. [–]). In addition  selection based on a combination of the candidates’ GEBV and their own phenotypes  which were routinely recorded  would also have slightly increased the accuracy of genomic selection. Thus  our results probably underestimated the potential technical superiority of genomic versus pBLUP schemes. Our results also showed that replacing pBLUP by genomic evaluations in a pig nucleus would have a very beneficial impact on the evolution of population inbreeding  confirming theoretical expectations []. The reason is that the breeding value of an individual can be considered as a combination of the breeding value of its parents and a Mendelian sampling term. The Mendelian sampling term is poorly estimated using pBLUP methodology for animals without phenotyped offspring  since the phenotypes of ancestors and relatives mostly contribute to the estimation of the parental component of an animal’s breeding value. As a consequence  the PEBV of related animals are correlated  especially for traits for which the candidates do not have an own phenotype. Consequently  the pBLUP scenario favoured the co-selection of related animals from among the candidates. This phenomenon was even more pronounced for breeding goal W1:3 than for W1:1  because of the greater weight on trait 2  for which full-sib candidates had the same relatives phenotyped for this trait and therefore the same PEBV. In contrast  genomic evaluation results in a more precise estimate of the Mendelian component of the breeding values  producing less correlated GEBV for related animals  less co-selection of related animals  and therefore a smaller increase in inbreeding. Increasing the number of litters with one sib phenotyped for trait 2 from 10% to 70% also reduced the increase in inbreeding under the pBLUP scenarios when a large weight was given to trait 2 in the breeding goal (W1:3). However  this favourable effect seemed to disappear  or even reverse  when this number exceeded 70%. The favourable trend observed up to 70% was not due to a reduction in the within-litter correlation between the EBV of candidates  as in the genomic schemes  but the result of a change in the heterogeneity of the accuracy of the PEBV for trait 2 among the candidates. In schemes with the smallest numbers of phenotyped sibs  only a few candidates benefited from one full-sib being phenotyped for trait 2. These animals had more accurate  and therefore less regressed  PEBV for this trait compared to the majority of candidates  which had only more distant phenotyped relatives. The animals born in these few litters consequently had a greater chance of being selected to renew the nucleus  especially since their birth litter had a high parental average PEBV. Moreover  the PEBV of litter-mate candidates were highly correlated  since they had the same PEBV for trait 2 (based on the data of the same phenotyped sibs)  which had a greater weight than trait 1 in the W1:3 breeding goal. This resulted in high inbreeding rates. Thus  increasing the proportion of litters with a phenotyped sib allowed candidates from more litters to have accurate PEBV for trait 2  which led to the selection of animals from a larger number of families and a deceleration in the increase in inbreeding. However  the procedure applied to choose litters with a phenotyped sib gave priority to litters produced by boars with the fewest offspring phenotyped for trait 2. In other words  the additional 20% phenotyped sibs in the BL_90% scenario compared to the BL_70% scenario mostly came from boars that had had the longest productive life and already a large number of offspring. One can assume that the litter-mates of these phenotyped sibs had consequently more accurate PEBV for trait 2 than the other candidates  and a greater chance to be selected  re-accelerating the increase in inbreeding in the population. In contrast  greater selection pressure was focused on trait 1 in the W1:1 goal  since the accuracy of the PEBV for this trait was higher than for trait 2. Because each candidate had its own phenotype for trait 1  the within-litter correlation between the PEBV was weaker for goal W1:1 than for W1:3  and the co-selection of full-sib candidates was less important. Thus  the level of inbreeding was lower for the W1:1 breeding goal  and the impact of the number of phenotyped sibs on this parameter was not noticeable. The benefits of GS in terms of greater annual gain for the breeding goal and lower rates of inbreeding had a cost  since the animals making up the initial TP  as well as 13 770 candidates and 270 phenotyped sibs per year under the reference scheme had to be genotyped. Genotyping all these animals with the porcineSNP60 beadchip would generate very high extra costs  exceeding €2 million per year (considering an approximate current price of €150/animal) for the simulated population considered under the reference scheme. Thus  we assumed that the use of imputation techniques was possible  enabling a dramatic reduction in the cost of implementing GS. Imputation is already routinely used in dairy cattle  with excellent results [–]. In pigs  recent studies [–] have also shown promising results. For simplicity  we assumed here that imputation of the candidates’ missing genotypes did not cause a loss in selection efficiency  which is not fully realistic and tends to favour the genomic scenarios in the economic comparisons. However  the results of Hickey et al. [] in pigs suggest that  assuming that candidates are genotyped for 5000 markers or more and have both their parents genotyped with the porcineSNP60 beadchip  the imputation error rate and therefore the loss of selection efficiency would indeed be very low  in which case our results remain valid. The second solution investigated here was to reduce the implementation costs of genomic evaluation by reducing the number of animals genotyped. This was achieved by downsizing the initial TP1 and reducing the annual number of candidates. In order to limit the loss in selection efficiency  the parental EBV of the litters were used as prior information to detect the most useful animals to genotype. Our results showed that this strategy was effective. The loss of efficiency in terms of response in the breeding goal and rate of inbreeding compared to the best potential genomic scheme (GE_ref) was indeed limited with reductions up to approximately 50% in the initial size of TP1 and in the annual number of genotyped candidates. The limited degree of loss in accuracy of GEBV despite significant reductions in the number of genotyped animals was due to the characteristics of TP1. First  the accuracy of GS is positively related to the size of the TP (e.g. [  ]) but the marginal increase in the predictive ability of a TP due to the inclusion of additional individuals decreases for large TP [  ]. In our simulations  TP1 varied from 13 770 in year 6 to 55 080 after year 9 under GE_ref. With such numbers  and given the heritability of trait 1 considered here (h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4)  the impact of a 20% or 40% reduction in size of the TP on accuracy was limited. It is however likely that the loss of accuracy would have been more marked for a less heritable trait. In addition  the accuracy of GEBV is also related to the degree of relationships between the candidates and the TP []  which was high in the present case since TP1 consisted of candidates  some of which became parents of the next generation. Thus  despite a reduction in size  the candidates still had closely related animals in TP1  which probably limited the loss in accuracy. The reduction in the number of candidates genotyped also resulted in a reduction in response for trait 1 because of a reduction in selection intensity  since a fixed number of young animals (10 females per TS for each herd  and nine males per TS) were selected from a smaller number of genotyped candidates. However  the loss in selection intensity was lower than might have been expected considering only the decrease in the number of candidates  since the discarded litters were selected based on their parental EBV. Thus  the chances of detecting one of the best candidates from among the animals born in the X% worst litters would have been low anyway  especially for low values of X. To verify this  we repeated the GE_40% scenario simulations for the W1:1 goal but discarding 60% of the litters at random. As expected  the loss in response for trait 1 compared to GE_ref was greater (-24%) than when the litters’ parental EBV was used (-12%). The moderate loss in selection response despite a marked reduction in the number of genotyped candidates observed in this study was consistent with the conclusions reached by Henryon et al. [] who also showed by simulation that most of the benefits from GS in a pig nucleus breeding scheme  in terms of genetic gain  can be achieved by genotyping a small proportion of the available candidates selected based on their PEBV  including their own phenotype. In our study  the prior information considered to target candidates to be genotyped was the parental EBV at birth  and piglets from the discarded litters were excluded from the pool of candidates  resulting in lower selection intensity. Another strategy would have been to phenotype for trait 1 also the piglets born in discarded litters and then jointly evaluate the genotyped and non-genotyped candidates using a 1-step GBLUP evaluation method [  ]. This strategy is similar to that considered in [] but with different prior information  and might have been even more efficient than the genomic scenarios that we applied  particularly in cases with a small number of genotyped candidates. First  the total number of candidates would have remained unchanged across the compared genomic scenarios  thus limiting the unfavourable impact on selection intensity of genotyping only a proportion of the candidates. Second  the genotyped animals would have had slightly more accurate GEBV for trait 1  resulting from additional records on non-genotyped related candidates. In that context  optimizing the proportion of male-to-female genotyping would be one way to further improve the efficiency of the genomic scenario []. The 1-step GBLUP strategy was  however  computationally too costly to be implemented in our simulations  and its additional benefits compared to the genomic scenarios simulated were therefore not evaluated. At present  the cost of genotyping breeding animals with the porcine60SNP beadchip and of genotyping young animals for sufficient SNPs to minimize the imputation error rate (5000 or more []) is similar to the most expensive of our three genotyping costs scenarios. In that context  an additional annual expense of €350 000 to €530 000 (depending on the cost of phenotyping additional sibs and on the relative weights of the traits in the breeding goal) would be necessary to render it more efficient  in terms of genetic gains  to implement genomic evaluation rather than improving the current pBLUP design. Thus  the threshold for implementation of GS is high  but probable reductions in genotyping costs in the future will gradually lower it. In addition  the results obtained by Huang et al. [] suggest that it might be possible to genotype candidates and phenotyped sibs for only a few hundred markers  while preserving most of the efficiency of genomic evaluations and reducing individual genotyping costs to approximately $25. The use of such optimized imputation strategies would lower the threshold for implementation of GS. Our results were obtained by simulating a pig nucleus of 1050 breeding females and 50 boars  selected to improve a combination of two unrelated traits. The average accuracy of the PEBV of candidates is expected to be similar in populations of different sizes but with the same structure as simulated here  since a candidate would have approximately the same number of closely related phenotyped animals  regardless of population size. As a consequence  ignoring the effects of population size on selection intensity and the effects of inbreeding  a given pBLUP scenario should provide comparable genetic gains in either a smaller or larger nucleus. In contrast  the sizes of the TP in a genomic scheme with the same structure as here  which are composed of candidates or phenotyped sibs  would increase with size of the nucleus population. Therefore  larger or smaller selection nuclei than simulated here can be expected to result in higher or lower average accuracies of GEBV and realized genetic gains. The relative benefits of the different pBLUP and genomic scenarios considered here therefore depend  to some extent  on the size of the nucleus population. Our proposed methodology must be repeated in order to produce results relevant to the different populations being considered for implementation of genomic evaluations. Further work is also necessary to examine the benefits of GS with respect to more realistic breeding goals that combine several correlated traits. Our results show that genomic selection could substantially increase genetic gains achieved in a purebred pig sire line breeding scheme organized around combined phenotyping of candidates and sibs with pBLUP evaluations  while significantly reducing the annual increase in inbreeding in the population. The potential improvements provided by implementing genomic evaluations significantly exceed the possible benefits of increasing phenotyping capacities for the most limited traits while retaining traditional pBLUP evaluations. Implementing a genomic breeding scheme would generate large additional costs. However  substantial savings could be achieved by pre-selecting the candidates to be genotyped based on their parental EBV  and still maintain an advantage over the traditional pBLUP scheme. From an economic point of view  implementing genomic evaluations is not always the most efficient investment to improve the efficiency of a breeding scheme  but a threshold for additional annual expenses can be determined  below which increasing the number of phenotyped sibs while maintaining pBLUP evaluations is preferred  and above which genotyping animals to implement genomic evaluations is more efficient. This threshold depends on the cost of phenotyping additional sibs  on genotyping costs in combination with the imputation strategy  on the breeding goal and on the size of the nucleus population. Therefore  a breeding company must consider the relevance of implementing genomic evaluations based on the characteristics of the population and its possible annual financial commitment.

Genomic breeding values were estimated within families and combined with conventional family breeding values for candidates that were pre-selected based on conventional BLUP breeding values. This strategy was compared with a conventional breeding scheme and a full genomic selection program for which genomic breeding values were estimated across the whole population. The effects of marker density  level of pre-selection and number of sibs tested and genotyped for the sib-trait were studied. Within-family genomic breeding values increased genetic gain by 15% and reduced rate of inbreeding by 15%. Genetic gain was robust to a reduction in marker density  with only moderate reductions  even for very low densities. Pre-selection of candidates down to approximately 10% of the candidates before genotyping also had minor effects on genetic gain  but depended somewhat on marker density. The number of test-individuals  i.e. individuals tested for the sib-trait  affected genetic gain  but the fraction of the test-individuals genotyped only affected the relative contribution of each trait to genetic gain. A combination of genomic within-family breeding values  based on low-density genotyping  and conventional BLUP family breeding values was shown to be a possible low marker density implementation of genomic selection for species with large full-sib families for which the costs of genotyping must be kept low without compromising the effect of genomic selection on genetic gain. A typical breeding goal for salmon contains traits that can be measured directly on the selection candidates  typically growth-related traits  and traits that are measured on sibs of the candidates  typically disease challenge and slaughter traits. Genomic breeding values [] depend less on own phenotype than traditional BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) breeding values  and can increase genetic gain  especially for traits that are difficult to improve by conventional selection []. Simulations  in which high-density genotyping of a large number of fish was assumed  showed that genomic selection could increase accuracy of selection and genetic gain in aquaculture species through increased selection accuracy  especially for traits measured on sibs of the selection candidates []. In aquaculture breeding  the number of selection candidates and test-individuals to genotype is large and thus  full genomic selection is more expensive to implement than in other species  especially regarding the low economic value of each selected individual []. Suggested implementations for genomic selection in aquaculture must therefore focus on cost efficiency. There are three intuitive ways to decrease the genotyping costs in an aquaculture genomic breeding scheme: reduce the number of markers  reduce the number of genotyped selection candidates  and reduce the number of genotyped test-individuals to be used in the reference-population  i.e. animals with phenotypes and genotypes used to estimate marker effects. However  each of these strategies includes a risk of losing the benefit of genomic selection through reduced accuracy of selection  by reducing the number of markers or the size of the reference population []  or by reducing selection  if too few selection candidates are genotyped to benefit from the genomic breeding values. One way to reduce genotyping costs is to pool DNA from test-individuals with high and low performance  respectively  and thereby analyse two test-samples for each trait  instead of one from each tested individual []. The pooling strategy facilitates communal rearing of individuals from different families  but does not contribute to reducing the number of selection candidates to genotype or the number of markers. Another way to reduce genotyping costs in a family-based breeding program is to estimate genomic breeding values separately within each family []. This within-family genomic selection facilitates low-density genotyping  because the required number of markers increases approximately in proportion to effective population size []. Hence  within a full-sib group  with an effective population size of 2  genotyping 100 markers should give approximately the same accuracy of the within-family deviation as genotyping 50 000 markers in a population with an effective population size of 1000 []. Estimation of a separate within-family component of the breeding value is based on the same principles as imputation []  but skipping the imputation-step means that no animal needs to be high-density genotyped. It is assumed that family breeding values with high accuracy are available  so that only the within-family component of the breeding value needs to be estimated using genomic information. It is also assumed that only additive genetic effects are taken into account  and that the breeding value of an individual can be estimated as a sum of the family breeding value and the within-family deviation from the family mean. In that case  the sum of conventional family breeding values and within-family genomic breeding values  using the same strategies as in the previously proposed within-family marker-assisted selection []  could result in a large increase in accuracy with low-density genotyping. The tested strategies to use within-family genomic breeding values are simple extensions of a traditional family-based breeding program that could be implemented without re-structuring the breeding program. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential of within-family genomic breeding values to increase genetic gain and reduce rate of inbreeding. Alternative strategies considered varying marker densities  levels of pre-selection and number of individuals with phenotypes and genotypes for a trait not measured on the selection candidates. The latter defines the size of the reference population for a trait measured on sibs of the candidates. These strategies were compared to a conventional breeding strategy  using only conventional BLUP breeding values  and a full genomic selection breeding strategy  using only genomic breeding values. Stochastic simulations were used for comparisons and the design resembled an aquaculture breeding population. A population with an effective population size of 1000 was simulated for 4000 generations  according to the Fisher-Wright population model to create a historical population in mutation-drift balance. Every individual had a diploid genome with ten 100 cM chromosomes  and polymorphisms were created by random mutations  as in Sonesson and Meuwissen []  resulting in SNPs randomly distributed over the genome. In the last generation  100 SNPs from each chromosome (1000 SNPs in total) were chosen randomly from the generated SNPs with a minor allele frequency above 0.05 and assigned to be QTL. We assumed a large number of QTL  each with a small effect  to avoid over-estimation of the information content in the genomic data. Among the remaining SNPs  the 50 or 100 SNPs with the highest minor allele frequencies from each chromosome were assigned as molecular markers to reflect different marker densities. To test marker densities below 50 per Morgan  every second marker  among the 50  was deleted repeatedly to create data with 25  12  6 and 3 markers per Morgan. This strategy resulted in low-density marker panels with an adequate distribution over each chromosome. Two traits were simulated  and each QTL had a simulated effect for these two traits  sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with means 0 and variance  where  and  are the genetic variances (both set to 1) for a trait measured on sibs (SIB) and a trait measured on the selection candidates (CAND)  respectively. The true breeding values (TBV and TBV) for each individual were calculated as the QTL effects multiplied by the number of copies of a given allele and used to generate phenotypic records. True genetic variances were estimated from the true breeding values  and for all scenarios they were very close to the expectation of 1 for both traits in the first generation before selection started (results not shown). The SIB-records (y) were simulated as: y<U+2009>=<U+2009>TBV<U+2009>+<U+2009>e  and CAND-records as y<U+2009>=<U+2009>TBV<U+2009>+<U+2009>e  where e and e were random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with variances s and s  respectively. It was assumed that both traits had a heritability of 0.25  and that the traits were genetically and phenotypically uncorrelated. The size and breeding structure of the population under selection were based on the salmon breeding population of AquaGen AS ()  but simplified to facilitate stochastic simulation. A base population of 300 males and 300 females was generated by random mating between individuals from the last generation of the historical population. The base generation animals were mated randomly  creating 300 full-sib families. From each full-sib family  200 offspring  100 males and 100 females  were considered as selection candidates and 10  20 or 33 offspring were considered as test animals  i.e. they obtained phenotypic records for SIB and could not be selected as parents. Subsequent generations were generated by selecting 300 males and 300 females among the selection candidates on their estimated breeding values and performing random mating to form 300 full-sib families in each generation  assuming non-overlapping generations. Equal economic weights were used for the two traits. From each full-sib family  a maximum of 15 females and 15 males were selected  to reduce the rate of inbreeding and avoid large differences in rate of inbreeding between selection strategies. Three different kinds of estimated breeding values were used; BLUP-EBV  GS-EBV and COMB-EBV. BLUP-EBV and COMB-EBV were estimated simultaneously for both traits  while GS-EBV was estimated separately for each trait and then combined. BLUP-EBV were estimated using conventional BLUP methodology  with the model:   where  was a ((C + S)<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector  where C and S are the total numbers of animals with CAND and SIB records  respectively  accumulating over generations  containing the phenotypes for the two traits CAND and SIB   was a (2<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector of the overall means for the two traits and  a ((C + S)<U+2009>×<U+2009>2) design matrix to assign observations to traits   was a ((C + S)<U+2009>×<U+2009>N) design matrix assigning the observations to N animals  where N is the number of animals in the pedigree  recorded from the first generation of the selection experiment   was a (2 N<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector of breeding values  with variance:  where  was the additive relationship matrix between the animals  and  was a vector of random residuals with variance  where  is the identity matrix. GS-EBV were genomic breeding values  estimated separately for each trait using the BLUP-method of Meuwissen et al. []  also sometimes referred to as genomic blup  which is a two-step approach. First  the marker effects were estimated with the model:  where  was the phenotypic record for individual   trait    was the mean of trait    was the number of markers   was the standardised marker genotype for animal i in position    was the random effect of marker  on trait   assumed to have a variance of  and  was a random residual for animal   trait .  where  is the number of 1-alleles animal  carries  and  is the frequency of the 1-allele in the population. Thereafter  GS-EBV were estimated as  for the selection candidates  where  is the estimate of the marker effect for marker   trait . The records used to estimate the marker effects came from all genotyped animals with phenotype  and differed between the two traits. For SIB  the reference population consisted of the genotyped test-individuals  while for CAND  the reference population consisted of genotyped selection candidates with CAND-records. The assumption that the genetic variance is known is not valid in real data  for which additional data might be needed to estimate the genetic variances. COMB-EBV was a combination of a conventional family estimated breeding value and a genomic within-family breeding value  where the COMB-EBV of individual i was calculated as: <U+2009> <U+2009> <U+2009><U+2009>  where  and  were vectors of BLUP-EBV of the sire and dam of individual   respectively  for the two traits  estimated as described in the BLUP-EBV-section  and  was the within-family genomic breeding values for individual   family   for the two traits  estimated for family  as <U+2009><U+2009><U+2009><U+2009><U+2009><U+2009>  where  was a ((c + s)<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector of observations from family   where c was the number of genotyped candidates from family  and s was the number of genotyped test-individuals from family    was a vector of means for the two traits for family    (dimension: (c + s)<U+2009>×<U+2009>2) and  (dimension: (c + s)<U+2009>×<U+2009>2(c + s)) were design matrices  assigning observations from family  to traits and individuals within the family  while  was a (2(c + s)<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector of within-family breeding values from family   expressed as a deviation from the family mean with variance  where  was the genomic relationship matrix for the animals from full-sib family   estimated based on the available markers as <U+2009>   where  is a matrix of standardised genotypes calculated within family . Other variables were as defined above. When estimating genomic breeding values within a family  only records from that family were used. Therefore  the reference populations for SIB (one for each family) consisted of 33 (in most cases  but fewer in some scenarios described later) test-individuals with records and genotypes  while the reference populations for CAND consisted of the genotyped selection candidates from the actual family and varied in size between families and strategies. None of the estimation methods for genomic breeding values included the own CAND-phenotype of the selection candidate directly  but the information was included in the estimation by including the selection candidate in the reference population for CAND. The within-family genomic selection strategy (W-FAM)  a two-step selection scheme designed to take advantage of the family based breeding program and COMB-EBV  which was compared to two different one-step approaches  one that used GS-EBV (GS_POP) and one that used BLUP-EBV (CONV). The within-family genomic selection strategies (W-FAM) consisted of two steps; pre-selection and final selection. Pre-selection was based on BLUP-EBV after the phenotypes for both traits were obtained. The number of pre-selected males and females  respectively  was varied from 1000 to 30 000 (3% - 100%). Pre-selecting 100% of the selection candidates is equivalent to omitting pre-selection and genotyping all candidates and test-individuals. The pre-selected candidates and all test-individuals from the families in which one or more candidates were pre-selected were genotyped. The pre-selected candidates obtained COMB-EBV  and final selection of 300 male and female parents for the next generation was based on these estimated breeding values. Stronger pre-selection led to fewer families as well as fewer animals within each family selected. The latter had consequences for the reference populations for CAND  which consisted of the genotyped selection candidates. The reference populations for SIB consisted of 33 individuals  irrespective of the level of pre-selection. Scenarios with fewer test-individuals (10 or 20 per family) and the effects of genotyping only a random 50% of these test-individuals were included to study the effects of the number of SIB phenotypes and/or genotypes. Within the W-FAM strategy  marker densities between 3 and 100 markers per Morgan were tested. For comparison  a conventional strategy (CONV)  and a full genomic selection strategy (GS_POP) were used. Both these strategies included only one selection step. In CONV  selection was performed based on BLUP-EBV after phenotypes were obtained for CAND on the candidates and for SIB on the test-individuals  equivalent to the pre-selection step in the W-FAM strategy. In GS_POP  all animals in the population were genotyped  and selection was performed in one step based on GS-EBV. The GS_POP-strategy was tested for two different marker densities  50 or 100 markers per Morgan. The GS_POP-strategy and the W-FAM strategy with 100% pre-selection were equivalent except for the breeding value estimation method used. The strategies were evaluated on their accuracy of selection  estimated as the correlation between true and estimated breeding values for the selection candidates  and genetic gain and rate of inbreeding averaged over 10 generations of selection. All results are averages of 50 replicates. Table  summarizes the results for selection accuracy  genetic gain and rate of inbreeding obtained with the different strategies for two marker densities (50 or 100 markers per Morgan) when no (CONV) or all (W-FAM and GS_POP) animals were genotyped. With both marker densities  genotyping all candidates and sibs within the W-FAM strategy for 50 markers per Morgan increased total genetic gain by 15%  compared to CONV  by increasing genetic gain for the SIB and CAND traits by 16% and 14%  respectively. Doubling the marker density to 100 markers per Morgan did not affect the W-FAM-results significantly. Using 50 markers per Morgan  GS_POP gave a reduction in total genetic gain and shifted genetic gain from CAND towards SIB  causing a 16% increase in genetic gain for SIB but a 19% reduction in genetic gain for CAND  compared to CONV. Increasing the marker density to 100 markers per Morgan increased total genetic gain for the GS_POP-strategy by 15%  but W-FAM still outperformed GS_POP when looking at the average over 10 generations. However  it should be noted that GS_POP had an accumulating reference population  while W-FAM re-built the reference populations every generation. GS_POP thereby gave low genetic gains for the first 2-3 generations  but performed similar to W-FAM after a plateau had been reached (results not shown). Even when evaluating the averages over 10 generations  GS_POP obtained a larger increase in genetic gain for SIB than W-FAM  but lower genetic gain for CAND. The difference between these strategies when no pre-selection is applied is how the family component of the breeding value is estimated  using genomics in GS_POP  but conventional BLUP in W-FAM. In both cases  the family component will be more accurately estimated for CAND than for SIB  due to more phenotypic records for CAND within each family and own phenotype for the selection candidates. Conventional BLUP breeding values were more sensitive to this than the genomic breeding values  causing the gap in accuracy between the family components of CAND and SIB to be larger in W-FAM than in GS_POP. The effects of breeding strategy and marker density on rate of inbreeding were limited by the restriction on the number of selected parents from each full-sib family. Still  the genomic selection schemes gave a reduction in rate of inbreeding of 7 to 29%  compared to CONV. GS_POP resulted in a higher rate of inbreeding than W-FAM when the marker density was 50 markers per Morgan  but the estimation methods re-ranked at a higher marker density  for which GS_POP gave the lowest rate of inbreeding. For W-FAM  the effect of marker density was limited  even for a wider range of densities (Table ). Regardless of trait  marker density had only small effects on the genetic gain down to the density of 12 markers per Morgan. At lower marker densities  genetic gain decreased with decreasing marker density. With only three markers per Morgan  total genetic gain was only 6% greater for W_FAM than for CONV  using less than 50% of the potential of the W-FAM strategy. When pre-selection was used to reduce the number of genotyped animals  the number of candidates to genotype was fixed while the number of test-individuals to genotype varied with the number of families from which the pre-selected candidates originated. The numbers of genotyped animals per generation are in Table  that shows that pre-selection reduced the number of genotyped animals by several thousands. When genotyping 10% of the selection candidates  94% to 98% of the potential additional gain from the W-FAM strategy was obtained  depending on marker density (Table ). The effect of pre-selection on total genetic gain increased with increasing marker density  i.e. at low marker densities  a stronger pre-selection could be applied without losing genetic gain. Rate of inbreeding increased by 3 to 29% when 10% of the candidates were pre-selected  compared to genotyping all candidates  and the effect of pre-selection increased as marker density increased up to 50 markers per Morgan (Table ). A method to reduce genotyping costs even more is to reduce the number of sibs tested and/or genotyped from each family. While the number of test-individuals from each family affected total genetic gain  the fraction of test-individuals genotyped affected the relative contribution of each trait to total genetic gain only. Thus  results are shown for SIB only. When a reduced number of test-individuals (10 to 20) was assumed  W-FAM increased genetic gain for SIB by 10 to 13%  compared to CONV  and the difference between genotyping half of or all the test-individuals was small and insignificant (Table ). When a reference population of 33 was assumed  genetic gain for SIB increased by 26% if all test-individuals were genotyped  but only by 15% if a random 50% of the test-individuals were genotyped  compared to CONV. These results indicate that in a situation for which the potential gain of W-FAM is small  genotyping fewer animals might not reduce the genetic gain  but for a potential larger improvement  more genotyped individuals are needed. The W-FAM strategy uses the typical family-based aquaculture breeding structure with large full-sib families  to obtain accurate conventional breeding values for each family and combine them with genomic within-family breeding values  only using molecular markers to estimate the deviation from the family mean for each candidate. Our hypothesis that W-FAM should require a much lower marker density than GS_POP was confirmed by the results. GS_POP showed a considerable effect of marker density  already between 50 and 100 markers per Morgan  while W-FAM showed no significant effect of marker density on genetic gain until very low marker densities were tested. Both strategies showed an effect of marker density on rate of inbreeding  but the difference in inbreeding between scenarios was limited  because of the common restriction on the number of selected full-sibs. Even at low marker densities  GS_POP and W-FAM schemes gave lower rates of inbreeding than CONV  due to the within-family selection. For W-FAM  the increase in accuracy of selection  compared to CONV  is 9 and 11% for 50 and 100 markers/Morgan  respectively (Table )  whereas total genetic gain increased by 15 and 17%  respectively. This may be explained by a lower correlation between the estimated breeding values of full-sibs  which increases the selection intensity in two ways: directly [] and via the constraint on the number of full-sibs selected from each family  which can be seen by the lower rate of inbreeding for W-FAM  compared to CONV. The W-FAM-results are not affected by the effective population size since each full-sib family is treated separately  and the genomic predictions are mainly tracing parents’ chromosome segments rather than population-wide linkage disequilibrium. However  thousands of animals were genotyped for each generation  when summing candidates and test-individuals. For any of the proposed strategies to be cost-effective  the genotyping costs per sample must be quite low  which is facilitated by the use of low-density marker panels. A pre-selection down to approximately 10% could be performed without losing more than 2 to 6% of the effect of W-FAM on genetic gain. This is in concordance with previously reported results for pigs  where a strong pre-selection before genotyping was recommended for genomic selection when animals had own phenotype before pre-selection was applied []. In the present study  phenotypes of candidates were assumed for one of the two traits under selection only  but full-sibs records were available for the other trait at the time of pre-selection and this information was included in the CONV-EBV used for pre-selection. Using W-FAM  pre-selection of candidates caused a reduction in the number of candidates to genotype  as well as test-individuals  because test-individuals from families with no pre-selected candidates were not genotyped. The number of animals genotyped to build a reference population was therefore reduced without reducing the accuracy of selection. However  rate of inbreeding was increased  probably because strong pre-selection increases the amount of between-family selection compared to within-family selection. The relative contribution of the two traits to total genetic gain was little affected by the number of pre-selected candidates (results not shown)  an expected result when assuming the traits to be un-correlated and both traits are considered in both selection steps. Tables  and  together show an interaction between marker density and level of pre-selection  which indicates that marker density is more relevant when more animals are genotyped and that level of pre-selection is also more relevant for higher marker densities. The number of genotyped sibs from each family affected the relative contribution of each trait to total genetic gain  rather than the total genetic gain. The potential of genomic selection to increase a SIB-trait could therefore be reduced if not all test-individuals are genotyped. Since genotyping more or less test-individuals affected the distribution of genetic gain among traits  the rate of improvement does not depend only on the characteristics of the tested trait but also on the other traits in the breeding goal. The effects of genotyping a fraction of the test-individuals within each family should therefore be tested by including data on all relevant traits before reduced genotyping of test-individuals is applied. In this study  the strategies were compared under assumptions believed to favour W-FAM over GS_POP  such as large families  a simple family structure and low marker densities. For the first generations  GS_POP also gave low gains due to the lack of a proper reference population until a few generations of reference animals had accumulated. After approximately five generations  GS_POP reached maximum accuracy  and evaluating only generations 5 to 10 caused GS_POP and W-FAM to perform similarly when a marker density of 100 was used (results not shown). For traits that are expensive to phenotype  it might therefore be more cost-effective to perform dense genotyping than to obtain phenotypes for several fish per family  especially in the long run  since GS_POP continuously increases the size of its reference population. For marker densities between 100 to 1000 markers per Morgan  an increase in accuracy of up to 33% was reported when comparing full genomic selection with a conventional strategy []. Thus the GS_POP-strategy might also be preferred in cases for which dense genotyping is cheap and available. Between adjacent QTL  r in the simulated dataset was 0.0353  and r between a QTL and the closest marker  using 100 markers per Morgan  was 0.0703. The r between adjacent markers when using 100 markers per Morgan was 0.117  showing a large effect of that we systematically chose SNPs with the highest minor allele frequency as markers. Thus  the required marker density in real data might be higher than indicated by the simulations  because the selection of SNPs on minor allele frequency performed in the simulations causes higher linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs than expected from the SNP density. The GS_POP-strategy could be performed without separate rearing of families  thereby reducing the bias of estimated breeding values due to common environmental effects and reducing costs related to separate rearing. However  on the one hand  W-FAM requires that the fish have a known pedigree  at least one generation back  because pre-selection is performed prior to genotyping. On the other hand  W-FAM can be implemented within the current breeding scheme of many species which produce large families and collect phenotypes from each family. Implementation can be done at low costs by pre-selection of candidates before genotyping  and by genotyping relevant sibs only at low marker density. Because the required marker density is low  the W-FAM strategy can also be useful for species for which no dense SNP-chips are available. The genomic breeding value estimation in W-FAM can probably be improved by using methods that trace markers back to older ancestors  extending the definition of what is called a family []. Also other improvements of the statistical method could increase the performance of W-FAM  such as weighted blending of pedigree and marker information and better use of the own performance information of the candidates. The W-FAM strategy was found to be able to increase genetic gain  compared to CONV  both for traits measured on candidates and for traits measured on sibs of the candidates. Pre-selection down to 10% of the candidates and marker densities down to 12 markers per Morgan could be used with only minor reductions in genetic gain. Assuming a family breeding program with large families  within-family genomic selection can be a low-risk and low-cost implementation of genomic selection where the genomic evaluation can be implemented within the current breeding scheme and give additional genetic gain.

Since the costs to develop SNP chips are decreasing  chips with 500 SNPs/Morgan should become available in a short-term horizon for non domestic species. With the growing availability of genomic tools  animal genetic studies are evolving with a wide and increasing diversity of applications. In recent years  genome-wide markers have been increasingly used in selection programmes of farm animals [] but much less in conservation programmes. One straightforward application of genomic tools in such programmes is to use information from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels to increase the accuracy of estimated genetic relationships between individuals [  ] which would improve the strategies aimed at managing genetic diversity. Management of populations under conservation programmes are usually aimed at maintaining the maximum possible genetic diversity (usually measured as expected and observed heterozygosity and sometimes also as allelic diversity) and avoiding high levels of inbreeding. This can be achieved by optimizing contributions of potential parents through the minimization of their global coancestry [–]. With a limited number of microsatellite-type markers  Fernández et al. [] concluded that the exclusive use of molecular information to compute coancestry coefficients for the optimization process was of limited value to maintain genetic diversity compared to genealogical information. However  recently de Cara et al. [] showed that with high-density panels of markers  the expected and observed heterozygosities maintained were higher using molecular coancestry than genealogical coancestry. The benefits of using marker information to maintain diversity at ungenotyped loci across the whole genome depend on the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between these loci and the markers used to manage the population  which itself depends on effective population size () and marker density (). In endangered populations   is usually low since many generations and  therefore  LD is expected to be high. This enhances the potential benefits of molecular approaches to maintain genetic diversity. However  the density of available SNP panels differs largely among species []. While high-density panels containing tens or hundreds of thousands of SNPs have been developed in the last years for farm animal species (e.g. cattle  sheep  swine  chicken  horse and salmon)  this is not the case for other species for which the payoff for SNP panels is more limited. However  as the technology becomes cheaper  arrays will be developed for non-commercial species []. Therefore  it is essential to determine the order of magnitude of the minimum SNP density required to maintain a significant percentage of the existing diversity through population management []. The aims of this study were to (i) investigate  through computer simulations  how  and SNP density affect the performance of molecular coancestry to maintain genetic diversity when used in the optimization of contributions; and (ii) determine the minimum SNP density required to maintain at least the same genetic diversity with molecular coancestry than with genealogical coancestry. Populations at mutation-drift equilibrium with LD between loci were generated through computer simulations. These populations were subsequently managed over ten generations based on genealogical or molecular information (see below). A large number of scenarios with different population sizes and numbers of markers per chromosome were considered. In order to generate a base population at mutation-drift equilibrium  5000 discrete generations of random mating were simulated. Four different population sizes (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20  40  80 or 160 individuals  half of each sex) were considered. Sires and dams were sampled with replacement and  was kept constant across generations. Note that under this regime  equals census size (). The genome was composed of 20 chromosomes of 1 Morgan each. Two types of biallelic loci (marker and non-marker loci) were simulated. Marker loci were used for management (see below) and non-marker loci were used for measuring diversity. The number of non-marker loci per chromosome was always 1000 but different densities were considered for marker loci (<U+2009>=<U+2009>10  30  50  100  500  1000 and 2000 SNPs per chromosome). All loci were equidistant and marker loci were interspersed between the non-marker loci in such a way that they covered the whole chromosome evenly. All loci were fixed for allele 1 at the initial generation (<U+2009>=<U+2009>–5000). The mutation rate per locus and generation was <U+2009>=<U+2009>2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 for both types of loci. The number of new mutations simulated at every generation was sampled from a Poisson distribution with mean 2 where  is the number of chromosomes and  is the total number of loci (markers and non-markers) per chromosome. Mutations were then randomly distributed across individuals  chromosomes and loci and they switched allele 1 to allele 2. If a mutation occurred at a position where a previous mutation had already occurred  this allele was allowed to return to its previous state (i.e.  1) instead of choosing another position for the mutation but this rate of reverse mutation was very low. Individuals were mated at random. When generating the gametes  the number of crossovers per chromosome was drawn from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to 1. Crossovers were randomly distributed without interference. For all scenarios considered  the population reached mutation-drift equilibrium after 5000 generations. We assessed this equilibrium by checking that the mean heterozygosity measured at non-marker loci was stabilized. The population at this point is referred to as the base population (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). In order to check the generality of the results for different mutation rates when creating the base population  some additional scenarios were run assuming a lower mutation rate (2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10). In these scenarios   was set to 1000 and tested marker densities were <U+2009>=<U+2009>2500  3000 and 3500 SNPs/Morgan. High values were chosen for  and  to achieve a reasonable number of segregating loci at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 given this lower mutation rate. Management of the population was carried out for ten discrete generations. Population size was kept constant across generations and equal to its size at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (i.e.  <U+2009>=<U+2009>20  40  80 or 160 individuals for the high mutation rate scenarios and 1000 for the low mutation rate scenarios). The management method followed the strategy of minimizing global coancestry. Thus  the contribution of each individual (i.e.  the number of offspring that each individual leaves for the next generation) was optimized by minimizing the following expression: where  is the contribution of individual  and  is the coancestry between individuals  and . Optimization was subjected to the following restrictions: both the sum of contributions of females and sum of contributions of males were equal to  (i.e.    where  and  are the numbers of female and male candidates  respectively) []. Coancestry coefficients () were calculated either from molecular or genealogical data. The molecular coancestry coefficient between individuals  and  was computed as   where  is the number of SNPs and  is the identity of the  allele of individual  with the  allele of individual  for SNP  and takes the value of 1 if both alleles are identical and zero if they are not []. Molecular coancestry coefficients used in the optimization across generations were calculated using only the marker loci segregating at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. Genealogical coancestries were calculated assuming that individuals at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 were unrelated and not inbred. All optimizations were performed using a “simulated annealing” algorithm as described by Fernández and Toro []. In addition  an extra set of simulations was carried out in which genotypes for non-marker loci (i.e.  loci targeted to minimize the loss of diversity) were assumed to be known and used in the optimization. These extra simulations provided the upper limit of the diversity level that could be maintained using molecular information. In these scenarios (NM)  molecular coancestry coefficients were calculated from the non-marker loci and thus  management was based on the same loci that were used to measure diversity. In all simulated scenarios  once the contributions were fixed  matings between individuals were performed at random. Expected (EH) and observed heterozygosities (OH) and allelic diversity (AD) were measured over all non-marker loci and evaluated across the ten generations of management for each simulated scenario. For a single locus  EH (also called gene diversity) was calculated as   where  is the frequency of allele   OH and AD were calculated  respectively  as the number of heterozygous individuals and the number of different alleles at the locus. These three variables were then averaged over all non-marker loci. The correlation between molecular and genealogical coancestry coefficients was also calculated across generations. Linkage disequilibrium was measured at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 as the average squared correlation coefficient between adjacent pairs of SNPs [] which can be expressed as   where  is the frequency of allele  at the first locus   is the frequency of allele  at the second locus and  is the difference between the observed haplotype frequency and the expected frequency under linkage equilibrium (). The results presented are averages over 50 replicates. A new base population at mutation-drift equilibrium was simulated for each replicate and the same base population was used for both management methods (genealogical and molecular). The current study was carried out with the consent from the INIA Scientific Ethic Committee. We hereby confirm that the INIA Scientific Ethic Committee which is the named IACUC for the INIA approved this study. As expected  the distribution of allelic frequencies at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 was U-shaped. The number of fixed loci was higher in populations with a lower . The proportion of segregating markers at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 ranged from 48 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) to 99% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>160). As expected  the amount of LD at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 before management began  increased with increasing  and with decreasing  (Figure ). Values for  ranged from 0.13 to 0.30 for <U+2009>=<U+2009>20 and from 0.02 to 0.10 for <U+2009>=<U+2009>160 in scenarios with the highest mutation rate. Notwithstanding  the increase observed in   when increasing   was small for high densities of SNP. For the scenarios with the lowest mutation rate ( =1000)   ranged from 0.065 to 0.072. These levels of LD are in the same range as those obtained in previous studies considering similar population parameters [  ].   <U+2009>    Table  shows EH values calculated when optimization was performed with molecular or genealogical information. Results obtained using genealogical data are expressed as deviations from those obtained using molecular data. OH values (not shown) were always higher than EH values across all the scenarios simulated. The mean difference between both measures of diversity was 3% and the maximum difference  reached with the lowest initial  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) and the lowest marker density (<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 SNP/Morgan)  was 8.4%. Thus  deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<U+2009>=<U+2009>(EH – OH)/EH) were always negative and ranged from -0.006 to -0.092. This was mainly due to sampling [] and to a lesser extent to the management strategy implemented  which resulted in lower levels of genetic relationships than those expected using random contributions. As expected  the initial heterozygosity (EH and OH) was higher in scenarios with higher  (Table ). These scenarios also maintained a higher amount of diversity across generations than those with lower . For instance  using genealogical data the percentage of EH maintained after ten generations of management for <U+2009>=<U+2009>20 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>160 was 88% and 98%  respectively. The levels of EH at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 ranged from 0.136 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) to 0.378 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>160) (Table ). This higher value is similar to that reported by Engelsma et al. [] who simulated a similar value of 4 that is proportional to heterozygosity. The maintained EH decreased regularly across generations in most scenarios  except when the SNP density was very high  in which case EH remained stable for several generations as previously reported and discussed by de Cara et al. []. In the extreme case in which non-marker loci were used in the optimization  EH even increased in the first generations. For low densities (generally  <U+2009><<U+2009>500)  management based on genealogical coancestry resulted in higher diversity than management based on molecular coancestry and the difference in EH between these two strategies increased across generations. For instance  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 and management based on molecular coancestry  the EH maintained at <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 reached 74% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) and 89% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>160) of the initial EH but with management based on molecular coancestry it increased to 88% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) and 99% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>160). However  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>500  the EH maintained with management based on molecular coancestry  i.e. 90% and 99% of the initial EH for <U+2009>=<U+2009>20 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>160  respectively  exceeded that with management based on molecular coancestry  i.e. 87% and 98% for <U+2009>=<U+2009>20 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>160  respectively. The advantage of using molecular coancestries increased with increasing . In any case  differences in heterozygosity between management strategies using both types of information (molecular and genealogical) were generally small. The proportion of EH maintained at <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 using marker information in the optimization compared to non-marker information (i.e. the upper bound for EH) increased with increasing densities (Table ). For example  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>20 (160)  the EH maintained reached 65% (80%) of the upper bound with <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 and 77% (88%) with <U+2009>=<U+2009>100. However  with <U+2009>><U+2009>100 the returns decreased and with <U+2009>><U+2009>500  the increase in EH was practically negligible. Figure  shows the difference in OH maintained at <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 between scenarios using molecular or genealogical coancestry for different . With a low density (e.g.  <U+2009>=<U+2009>10)  the performance of molecular-based management improved with increasing   although as mentioned above this performance was worse than that of genealogical-based management for all values of . With <U+2009>><U+2009>30  the performance of molecular-based management increased with decreasing .                                                                                                                                                                               For the smallest  considered  a <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 (i.e.  <U+2009>=<U+2009>5  SNP/Morgan) was sufficient to reach higher levels of diversity with molecular than with genealogical coancestry. For <U+2009>><U+2009>20  the density required to achieve these levels increased to 500 SNPs per chromosome. Given that scenarios with intermediate densities between <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>500 were not simulated  the number of markers required for management based on molecular coancestry to maintain the same levels of heterozygosity than that for management based on genealogical coancestry was estimated for each  through linear interpolation  assuming that the change in performance from <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 to <U+2009>=<U+2009>500 was constant. Values obtained were equal to about 3 times  (ranging from 2.6 to 3.3). This result showing that a SNP density of 3 SNP/Morgan for molecular coancestry was required to equalize the performance of genealogical coancestry was generalized to the scenarios in which the mutation rate used to generate the base population was reduced by two orders of magnitude (from 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 to 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and  was increased correspondingly (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1000). The difference in OH maintained at <U+2009>=<U+2009>10 between scenarios using molecular or genealogical coancestry was -0.003  0.000 and 0.002 for <U+2009>=<U+2009>2500 (/<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.5)  3000 (/<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.0) and 3500 (/<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.5)  respectively. Thus  the same result is found with different combinations of  and . When AD was used as measure of diversity  genealogical coancestry was always more efficient in maintaining diversity than molecular coancestry except for the scenario with the smallest  and the highest SNP density (Figure ). It is interesting to note that for a given   the largest difference in AD between both management strategies (i.e.  using genealogical or molecular coancestry) occurred at intermediate values of .                                                                                                                                                                               Table  shows the evolution across generations of the correlation between molecular and genealogical coancestries obtained when management was based on molecular data. The correlation was highest with the smallest  and the highest . In general  the correlation was high (over 0.8) except in early generations for scenarios with a low . Counter-intuitively  higher correlations between molecular and genealogical coancestry at <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 did not lead to smaller differences between both management methods. This study investigated the effect of effective population size () and marker density () on the efficiency of molecular coancestry when used in the optimization of contributions aimed at minimizing the loss of genetic diversity. As expected  higher densities and lower  improved the performance of the management based on molecular coancestry. This was due to the higher LD created between marker loci and non-genotyped loci at which diversity was measured. The density of SNPs required to maintain at least the same heterozygosity than that maintained using genealogical data was approximately 3 SNP/Morgan. The benefits of using molecular coancestry calculated with dense marker data were small when compared to genealogical coancestry (a benefit of 3% in the most favorable molecular scenario). However  these results differed significantly from those obtained using microsatellites [  ] in which case management based on genealogical coancestry always outperformed that based on molecular coancestry. The combined use of genealogical and molecular information could increase furthermore the precision of the coancestry coefficient and therefore its efficiency []. Molecular coancestry coefficients have been calculated as the proportion of shared alleles between individuals. Many corrections aimed at making molecular coancestry closer to genealogical coancestry have been proposed and all assume that initial allelic frequencies are known [  ]. However  at least in our context of management aimed at maintaining the highest levels of diversity  there is no advantage in applying these corrections. De Cara et al. [] showed that when the number of markers is sufficiently large  the use of molecular coancestry always maintains higher levels of diversity than genealogical coancestry. They also tested two estimators  which did not improve the performance of molecular coancestry. Clearly  density requirements depend on the purpose for which markers are used. In the context of genomic selection  Solberg et al. [] reported that the accuracy of selection continued to increase with increasing marker density at least up to 8  for scenarios with <U+2009>=<U+2009>100. However  the increase in SNP density had reduced returns in terms of accuracy. They showed that by doubling marker density from 1 to 2 the accuracy of estimated breeding values increased by 14%. This figure was reduced to only 2% when marker density was doubled from 4 to 8. This very small increase in accuracy appears to be insufficient to justify the increase in marker density  especially taking into account that with a density of 4 SNP/Morgan the accuracy had already reached 92% of the upper bound that could be obtained theoretically []. Similarly  in the context of conservation programmes  the increase in SNP density had reduced returns in terms of maintained diversity (Figure ). In scenarios with <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  the EH maintained after 10 generations ranged from 77% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>20) to 88% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>160) of the upper bound (obtained when non-marker loci were used in the optimization). These figures increased  respectively  to 80 and 90% when marker density was increased to 500 and then stayed practically constant with higher densities. Thus  under the conditions studied here  a density of 500 could be considered as the most cost effective density  given that it makes it possible to maintain a substantial amount of heterozygosity with a relatively small number of markers. Most of the SNP chips already available for farm animals (e.g. cattle  sheep  swine  chicken  horse and salmon) contain more than 500 SNP/Morgan and thus  they would be suitable for programmes on the conservation of genetic resources using a method based on the minimization of coancestry. Thus  when developing SNP chips for a new species with this objective  the marker density should reach 500 SNP/Morgan. Since the costs of developing SNP chips are decreasing  SNP chips with such densities should be feasible in a short-term horizon. Solberg et al. [] concluded that a density of 800 was not sufficient to achieve the maximum accuracy of genomic breeding values. This density is considerably higher than that recommended here for the maintenance of diversity (<U+2009>=<U+2009>500). For other tasks associated with conservation genetic programmes such as the determination of relatedness between individuals  a density lower than 500 SNP/Morgan would be sufficient []. As mentioned above  the performance of management based on molecular coancestry relative to that based on genealogical coancestry increased with decreasing   except when the density of SNPs was very low. This could be due to the fact that with a very low density  the level of LD between markers and non-genotyped loci is low even for the smallest . However  larger sample sizes (i.e.  larger ) can make the detection of groups of individuals with higher levels of genetic diversity possible. We observed that as  increased  the effect of  over the existing LD became more pronounced. The overall effect is that higher  lead to a substantial reduction in LD counteracting the beneficial effect of larger sampling sizes on the performance of management based on molecular coancestry. Allelic diversity has been considered as an alternative measure of genetic diversity  particularly from a long-term perspective because the limits to response to selection are determined by the initial number of alleles and because allelic diversity is more sensitive to bottlenecks than EH and therefore reflects better past fluctuations in population size []. It should be noted that the optimization method used here was originally developed to maximize expected heterozygosity and thus AD is maintained only indirectly [  ]. Consequently  the power of using markers to maintain AD is lower than that to maintain heterozygosity and therefore larger densities are required for molecular information to outperform genealogical management in terms of AD. In fact  this only occurred with <U+2009>=<U+2009>2000 and for <U+2009>=<U+2009>20. The fact that for any given   the performance of management based on molecular coancestry was less good for intermediate  could also be the consequence of the opposite effects of increasing  (i.e. reduced LD but increased sample size). As expected  the correlation between molecular and genealogical coancestries increased with increasing density but this was not translated in an increased similarity in the diversity maintained with both approaches. At <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  all individuals were assumed to be unrelated and  thus  genealogical coancestry was uniform across the individuals. This led to the equalization of contributions from all individuals. However  molecular coancestry varied and the optimization method could find a combination of contributions that resulted in higher levels of EH even when some of the candidates did not contribute at all (about 60% of the individuals did not yield offspring). The higher the number of markers  the higher was the variation in coancestry between individuals and the power of the method to discriminate between them. This led to a higher efficiency of molecular coancestry to maintain genetic diversity. Therefore  even with very high correlations between coancestries both methods produce different results. Here  we investigated the benefits of using molecular SNP data to maintain the levels of global diversity of a population. Another advantage of using molecular information is the possibility of maintaining diversity at specific genome regions especially those responsible for adaptive variation. However  this could increase inbreeding and loss of diversity in the rest of the genome []. Thus  in this situation  it would be preferable to manage local and global diversity simultaneously by imposing restrictions on global coancestry while optimizing the local diversity maintained. In conclusion  a SNP density of 3 SNP/Morgan seems to be sufficient to maintain at least the same level of heterozygosity than that maintained with genealogical data. SNP chips of higher densities are available for farm animal species and they are expected to be soon available for wild species. Thus  molecular coancestry could become a powerful tool in the management of conservation programmes for the maintenance of genetic diversity. Goddard ME: Uses of genomics in livestock agriculture.

These effects cannot be observed directly and models used to study pre-weaning growth assume that they are additive. However  it is reasonable to suggest that the influence of direct effects on growth may differ depending on the value of maternal effects i.e. an interaction may exist between the two components.MethodsTo test this hypothesis  an experiment was carried out in Romane sheep in order to obtain observations of maternal phenotypic effects (milk yield and milk quality) and pre-weaning growth of the lambs. The experiment consisted of mating ewes that had markedly different maternal genetic effects with rams that contributed very different genetic effects in four replicates of a 3 × 2 factorial plan. Milk yield was measured using the lamb suckling weight differential technique and milk composition (fat and protein contents) was determined by infrared spectroscopy at 15  21 and 35 days after lambing. Lambs were weighed at birth and then at 15  21 and 35 days. An interaction between genotype (of the lamb) and environment (milk yield and quality) for average daily gain was tested using a restricted likelihood ratio test  comparing a linear reaction norm model (interaction model) to a classical additive model (no interaction model).ResultsA total of 1284 weights of 442 lambs born from 166 different ewes were analysed. On average  the ewes produced 2.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8 L milk per day. The average protein and fat contents were 50<U+2009>±<U+2009>4 g/L and 60<U+2009>±<U+2009>18 g/L  respectively. The mean 0–35 day average daily gain was 207<U+2009>±<U+2009>46 g/d. Results of the restricted likelihood ratio tests did not highlight any significant interactions between the genotype of the lambs and milk production of the ewe.ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis of additivity of maternal and direct effects on growth that is currently applied in genetic evaluation models."

An interaction between genotype (of the lamb) and environment (milk yield and quality) for average daily gain was tested using a restricted likelihood ratio test  comparing a linear reaction norm model (interaction model) to a classical additive model (no interaction model). A total of 1284 weights of 442 lambs born from 166 different ewes were analysed. On average  the ewes produced 2.3<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.8 L milk per day. The average protein and fat contents were 50<U+2009>±<U+2009>4 g/L and 60<U+2009>±<U+2009>18 g/L  respectively. The mean 0–35 day average daily gain was 207<U+2009>±<U+2009>46 g/d. Results of the restricted likelihood ratio tests did not highlight any significant interactions between the genotype of the lambs and milk production of the ewe. Our results support the hypothesis of additivity of maternal and direct effects on growth that is currently applied in genetic evaluation models. Pre-weaning growth is a complex trait for which phenotypic observations recorded on the lamb result from effects contributed by two individuals: by the lamb via direct effects and by the mother via maternal effects. The direct effects correspond to the suckling behaviour and growth ability of the young. Maternal effects depend on the mother’s ability to produce the milk required for growth and her maternal behaviour  and are strictly environmental from the perspective of the lamb []. Both direct and maternal effects are under genetic and environmental control. In the context of pre-weaning growth models  the standard assumption is that the observed phenotype is the sum of the environmental and genetic effects contributed by the ewe and its lamb []. In some cases  these models produce surprising results  e.g.  strong negative estimates of the correlation between maternal and direct genetic effects [  ]. Some authors have suggested that the hypothesis of additivity between direct and maternal effects may be too restrictive []. Experimental findings have demonstrated significant interactions between maternal and offspring genotypes in mice [] and insects []. Wolf [] gave a simple explanation of this in the case of mammals for growth performances: “…if offspring differ in how efficiently they process milk  and this difference has a genetic basis  then the contribution of the maternal character (performance on milk production) would not be additive”  or in other words  growth<U+2009>=<U+2009>milk production*feed conversion efficiency. This suggests the presence of an interaction between direct and maternal effects. Our aim was to test this hypothesis in Romane sheep in order to determine whether the assumption of additivity applied in current genetic evaluation models is appropriate or not. To achieve this  we developed an experimental design in which both growth and maternal phenotypes were recorded. Using a reaction norm model  we tested for the presence of an interaction between the direct genetic effect of the lamb and the maternal phenotypes. The experiment was carried out over a three-year period in order to obtain observations of maternal effects (milk quantity and quality) and growth records in Romane sheep. It consisted of mating ewes with markedly different maternal genetic effects (three groups: high  moderate and low maternal genetic effects) with rams that contributed very different direct genetic effects (two groups: high and low direct genetic effects) in four replicates of a 3 × 2 factorial plan. The measurements were performed on the lambs that resulted from these matings. Ewes and rams were selected from Romane sheep born at the INRA experimental farm La Sapinière (France) and which constitute the nucleus flock of the INRA401 composite sheep strain []. Estimated breeding values (EBV) based on average daily gain from 0 to 45 days (0-45 day ADG) obtained with an additive animal model (including direct and maternal effects) were used to classify the animals into different maternal and direct genetic effects groups. To obtain these EBV  data on lamb growth from 4260 multiparous Romane ewes (19 203 lambs  294 sires) were analyzed. Random effects included in the model were correlated direct and maternal genetic effects and permanent environmental effects for the ewe and litter effects. Significant fixed environmental effects and one way interactions for age of the ewe  sex of the lamb  litter size at birth*litter size at weaning  and year*season were included also. Based on the resulting EBV  240 multiparous ewes (2 to 3 years old) were selected: 80 with high maternal genetic effects  80 with moderate maternal genetic effects and 80 with low maternal genetic effects. Twelve rams  six with low direct genetic effects and six with high direct genetic effects  were selected also. Animals were divided into two cohorts (named A and B)  with equal numbers of animals from the direct and maternal genetic groups. During the experimental period  each ewe was mated twice (in April 2009 and April 2010 for animals in cohort A  in June 2010 and April 2011 for animals in cohort B). If the first mating of a ewe was performed with a male of the low direct genetic effects group  then the second mating was performed with a male of the high direct genetic effects group  and vice versa. The first mating of both cohorts was carried out at the La Sapinière experimental farm  after which the animals were moved to the INRA experimental farm Langlade for the second mating. Natural mating occurred after synchronization of the females by inserting a 20 mg FGA vaginal sponge (Chronogest CR  Intervet) for 14 days  followed by injection of 300 or 400 UI PMSG (Chronogest PMSG  Intervet) just after withdrawal of the sponge. The lambs born from these matings were separated into two groups that were  respectively  artificially reared and maternally reared. In the maternally reared group  the lambs were twin-reared indoors with their mothers in small groups of six to nine ewes (eight groups per cohort and per year) in 14.5 m pens. From lambing to 28 days after lambing  ewes were fed with 900 g hay  2700 g silage and 1100 g concentrate. From 28 to 42 days after lambing  ewes were fed with 1200 g hay  3500 g silage and 650 g concentrate. To avoid stealing of milk  lambs were placed in a small pen when ewes were fed. Lambs did not have access to their mothers’ food until they were 35 days old. Lambs were weighed at birth  15  21  35 and 60 days after lambing and at slaughter (between 90 and 120 days). Milk yield was estimated using the lamb suckling weight differential technique [] at around (depending on the date of lambing of the ewe) 15  21 and 35 days after lambing  as follows: from 5:00 AM to 7:45 AM  lambs were separated from their mothers  then returned to the ewes and allowed to suckle and empty the udder. At 8:00 AM  they were once again separated from their mothers. At 10:30 AM  the ewes were moved to individual pens (1.45 m) and the lambs were weighed prior to suckling the ewe for a short period lasting a maximum of 15 min (the lambs were removed from their mothers as soon as they finished suckling). The lambs were weighed again after suckling and lambs and ewes returned to separate pens. At 1:30 PM  the ewes were moved again to individual pens and the weigh-suckle-weigh procedure was carried out. After the second weighing  lambs and ewes were returned to the same pen. Milk composition was determined from samples of at least 15 mL collected by hand milking from both sides of the udder after a short lamb suckling period (2 minutes) in order to empty the cistern. The ewes and lambs were managed in the same way on the day of milk collection as on the day of milk yield evaluation. Samples were collected on days 15 and 21 at 10:30 AM and on day 35 after lambing at 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM and milk fat (MF) and protein (MP) contents were determined by infrared spectroscopy at the LIAL commercial laboratory. From day 35 postpartum  lambs were fed hay ad libitum and protein in the form of commercially-prepared lamb creep pellets. Milk production records were used to define the maternal phenotypic effects of the ewes as a continuous variable. Two maternal effects were considered: milk yield per day (MY) and total milk solids (TMS)  defined as TMS<U+2009>=<U+2009>(MF<U+2009>+<U+2009>MP)*MY for each of the three collection days (the mean MF and MP over the morning and afternoon were used to define milk composition on day 35). The ADG of maternally-reared lambs for the three periods (from 0 to 15  15 to 21 and 21 to 35 days) were used as the dependent variable. In order to test whether there was an interaction between direct and maternal phenotypic effects (MY or TMS)  the following recursive reaction norm model with known covariate [  ] was used to analyse the data: where  is  or  is the ADG of the lambs for the three periods                 are the fixed class effects of age at weighing (15  21 or 35 days)  year (2009  2010  2011)  sex of the lamb  weight of the lamb at birth (< 2.5 kg  ><U+2009>=<U+2009>2.5 kg and<U+2009><<U+2009>3.5 kg  ><U+2009>=<U+2009>3.5 kg and<U+2009><<U+2009>4.5 kg  ><U+2009>=<U+2009>4.5 kg)  lag in days between milk measurement and age at weighing ([-4 4])  litter size at birth ([  ])  “sex” of the litter (1<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 females  2<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 male and 1 female  3<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 males)  age of the dam (2  3 or 4 years old);  is the interaction between age at weighing and lag time between weighing and milk measurement   is a regression coefficient    is the additive genetic effect of the dam   and  are the additive genetic effects of the lamb on the intercept and slope of the linear reaction norms with variance covariance matrix    where  is the additive relationship matrix  and  and  are residuals with variance covariance matrix  Fixed effects included in the models were selected in a step-by-step descending procedure  comparing the nested models with the likelihood ratio test (alpha risk was set at 5%). For this selection  single-trait models ignoring relationships were fitted using the mixed procedure of SAS version 8.1 []. The interaction between genotype of the lamb and milk production of the ewe was tested by comparing the previous recursive reaction norm model to a model that ignores the term  x  (recursive intercept model)  using the restricted likelihood ratio test (RLRT<U+2009>=<U+2009>-2logL<U+2009>+<U+2009>2logL  where logL is the logarithm of the restricted maximum likelihood of model x) . These two models were fitted using the ASReml software []. In the recursive intercept model  heritability for MILK was estimated as . The direct and maternal heritabilities for ADG were estimated as  and   with  Heritabilities estimated with the additive model used to estimate EBV to select sires and dams for 0-45d ADG were 0.15<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 and 0.07<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.02 for direct and maternal genetic effects  respectively. The estimate of the genetic correlation between the two traits was 0.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.14. The average maternal EBV for the low  medium and high maternal genetic effects group were -9.7 (standard deviation SD 4.4)  4.0 (SD 3.3) and 16.6 g/day (SD 3.5)  respectively. The average direct EBV for the low and high direct genetic effects group were -14.1 (SD 8.5) and 29.1 g/day (SD 7.0)  respectively. The average fertility rate for the matings made was 79% and mean prolificacy was 2.4 lambs per ewe. There were 476 lambs in the maternally reared group (corresponding to 175 ewes  of which 71 naturally suckled their lambs during two successive years of the experiment). The average lamb mortality rate between days 0 and 60 was 2.5%. Thirty-four lambs were eliminated from the analysis because they were single suckling due to the death of its full-sib and were  therefore  not representative. Furthermore  2% of the pre/post suckling weighing data were eliminated from the analysis because their lambs did not suckle for one of the time points. The final dataset contained 1284 records on 442 lambs born from 166 ewes. The mean ADG of the lambs over the 0–35 day period was equal to 207 g/day (SD 46). As expected (Table )  the mean ADG was significantly higher in the high than in the low direct genetic effects group (<U+0394><U+2009>=<U+2009>12<U+2009>±<U+2009>4 g/day) and in the high compared to the medium (<U+0394><U+2009>=<U+2009>16<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 g/day) and low (<U+0394><U+2009>=<U+2009>28<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 g/day) maternal genetic effects group. Summary statistics on ADG and milk production by age are in Table . ADG was significantly higher in the 0–15 day period than in the 15–21 day and the 21–35 day periods (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). The average milk yield was 2.3 L/day (SD 0.8) and tended to decrease with age of the lambs over the 15–35 day period. There was a significant positive relationship between milk yield and the maternal genetic effects groups; the average milk yield was higher in the group with high maternal genetic effects (2.5 L/day) than in the groups with moderate (2.3 L/day) and low maternal genetic effects (2.2 L/day). The average MF was 60 g/L (SD 18) and the average MP was 50 g/L (SD 4). There was no clear difference in MF and MP between the maternal genetic effects group. The average TMS was 253 g/day (SD 87)  significantly different depending on the maternal genetic effect group: means of 238<U+2009>±<U+2009>5  247<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 and 272<U+2009>±<U+2009>5 g/day in the low  medium and high maternal genetic group  respectively. Phenotypes for MY and TMS were  of course  highly correlated (0.90). The mean correlation between phenotypes for MY and ADG was 0.58 and remained quite stable with age of the lambs. The correlation between phenotypes for TMS and ADG was slightly lower (0.54). The recursive reaction norm model with TMS as a covariate did not converge. Thus  results of models with TMS are not presented. Variance components estimated with the recursive intercept and reaction norm models with MY as covariate are in Table . Results of the restricted likelihood ratio test  comparing the recursive intercept and reaction norm models showed no significant interaction (RLRT<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.58) between direct genetic and maternal phenotypic effects. The residual variance was similar for both models (˜ 820) and much lower than the phenotypic variance (2887). Heritabilities estimated for the direct and maternal effects for ADG in the intercept model were higher than estimates from the additive model that was used to select parents of the offspring: 0.34<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 and 0.23<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  respectively. The heritability of MY was high 0.66<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03. The estimated genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects was high and positive at 0.47<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.26. The regression coefficient linking ADG to MY was similar for both models (3.9)  indicating that a 0.1 L/day increase in MY by the mother induced a 3.9 g/day increase in ADG for each of her lambs. The mean prolificacy rate observed during our experiment was higher than that reported in Romane sheep by the French national recording scheme in 2010 (1279 ewes with a mean prolificacy rate after female synchronization equal to 2.13)  in part because national records include younger females. Lamb mortality in the naturally-reared group (2.5%) was lower than that reported for the Romane breed in France (6%) but within the same range as that reported by another study in Scottish Blackface sheep []. Average growth rate was in line with that reported for the breed (French national recording scheme). The objective of this study was to test whether an interaction exists between direct genetic and maternal phenotypic effects affecting ADG  given that these two components cannot be observed in practice. Environmental sensitivity to unobservable environmental factors can be analysed using a reaction norm model with an unknown covariate (RNUC). Different approximations [] or ad-hoc procedures [] have been reported to account for unknown covariates in reaction norm models. In RNUC  estimation of covariance functions is very sensitive to the data structure (number of animals per environment and connectedness between environments) []. Furthermore  Shariati et al. [] demonstrated that the variance of the environmental effects is not identifiable if there is not at least one pair of unrelated animals in the same environment  which does not occur for pre-weaning growth  except with cross-fostering. For these reasons  we did not use RNUC to test for an interaction of direct with maternal effects but designed an experiment to obtain observations of the environmental effects contributed by the dam. The experimental approach used is valid only if we are confident in the measurements of maternal effects obtained  i.e. that they are not biased. We evaluated milk yield using the weigh-suckle-weigh method. Since it had been shown that there is a positive correlation (0.86) between milk yield estimates obtained over a full 24 h period and those derived from a 12 h period []  we extrapolated the daily yield using a 6 h test period for experimental convenience  similar to what has been done by other research groups []. It is acknowledged that the weigh-suckle-weigh method tends to underestimate milk yield  for several reasons: a lamb may not be able to consume all the milk available during a short period of suckling []  a disturbance of normal suckling behaviour on the day of the test may induce a reduction in milk intake by the lamb [] or inhibit milk release by the ewe []  and the weight increment may be underestimated due to the voiding of faeces and urine []. In order to limit such underestimation  milk yield was only estimated in ewes rearing two lambs to ensure that all available milk was consumed  and the ewes and lambs were trained to be separated and grouped several times during the day. The excretion of faeces or urine between two successive weighings was recorded during a test of the weighing method and the proportion of such events was found to be small (less than 8% of the lambs). Also  underestimation of milk yield is not a problem in our case since it is a non-differential bias that does not affect the ranking of the ewes for milk yield. To obtain a more accurate measurement of milk production  one solution might be to make a third mating and to collect milk from the ewe by a milking machine throughout lactation (assuming that lactation remains stable with age). Milk production adjusted for the number of lambs born then corresponds to a maternal effect if there is no difference between ewes regarding how they accept the constraint of machine milking. However  milking is a difficult task in meat sheep. To test the presence of an interaction between direct and maternal effects  we used a linear reaction norm model. Higher-order polynomials were tested but the models failed to converge. In the literature  reaction norm models with significant higher order terms are exceptions [  ]. To take the relationship between ADG and milk yield into account  we used a recursive model  which assumed that milk yield of the ewe affected ADG of the lamb but that ADG had no effect on milk yield. Some authors have considered a simultaneous relationship between ADG and average daily feed intake []. This positive feedback of ADG on milk yield may not occur in our case because  as explained previously  twin rearing should insure that the maximal milk production potential of the ewe is reached regardless of the ADG of the lambs. The estimate of heritability for milk yield was higher than has been reported in the literature for dairy sheep []. Estimates of heritabilities for direct and maternal effects for ADG from the reaction norm model were also higher than reported in the literature [] and than estimated with the additive linear model that was used to select parents of the offspring. Higher heritabilities can be explained by the selection of parents and the more controlled environment in which the study took place in comparison with field data which is confirmed by the lower ratio of the residual variance to the phenotypic variance observed on our experimental data in comparison with field data (0.28 versus 0.46). Furthermore  our reaction norm model did not include a permanent environmental effect of the lamb (the model did not converge for that case) to take repeated measurements into account  which could also have contributed to overestimation of the heritability. For MY  the permanent environment of the ewe was not included in the model because its variance was not significantly different from 0. Our estimate of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects was in the range of those obtained in previous studies  which varied from -0.52 [] to +0.52 []. Contrary to what was expected  we were not able to identify a significant interaction between direct effects and milk production using the reaction norm model. A first explanation for the discrepancy between our findings and our interpretation of the physiological equation (growth<U+2009>=<U+2009>feed conversion efficiency*milk consumption*milk quality (physiology)  growth = direct effects* milk consumption*milk quality (interpretation)) could be that our test had insufficient power because  although parents were chosen based on extreme direct or maternal genetic effects  the genetic difference between direct effects for lambs or between milk productions of the ewes was not sufficiently large. A second explanation is that our interpretation of the physiological equation is correct but the feed conversion efficiency (FCE) varied with the milk consumed differently depending on the genotype of the lamb in such a way that it eliminated an interaction between direct effects of the lamb and milk production. The corresponding model for ADG of animal  in (milk) environment  could be the following (ignoring other environmental effects for the sake of simplicity): <U+2009>=<U+2009>(<U+2009>+<U+2009>)<U+2009>+<U+2009> (model 1) where  is the direct genetic effect of animal  in environment  and  is the mean feed conversion efficiency. If  then model 1 becomes <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>   which is a model with no interaction between direct and maternal effects. Change in feed conversion efficiency with change in feed intake has been reported in the literature [–]. In our case  we observed that the FCE decreased with the quantity of milk consumed and was not correlated with ADG (Figure ). Nonetheless  we found no strong evidence in the literature indicating that the effect of feed intake on FCE differs depending on the genotype of the animals considered. To confirm this hypothesis  it would be interesting to evaluate the FCE of lambs with different genotypes when they are artificially reared with different controlled quantities of milk available each day. We plan to conduct this experiment in the near future on the experimental farm of Langlade (France).                                                  This experiment  conducted over a three-year period with a large number of animals  made it possible to obtain information on the milk production and consumption of Romane sheep which  to our knowledge  has not been reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to measure direct genetic and maternal phenotypic effects to test for the existence of an interaction between them. We were not able to highlight any interactions between the direct and maternal effects in this experiment  which supported the hypothesis of additivity used in genetic evaluation models.

With this marker density  confidence intervals were sufficiently small (14 cM on average) to search for candidate genes. Altogether  this new information provides a valuable starting point for the identification of causative genes responsible for important QTL controlling growth  body composition and metabolic traits in the broiler chicken. For decades  major genetic improvements in growth and body composition of broiler chickens have been achieved by standard selection based on pedigree and phenotypic information. For body weight (BW)  which has a moderate heritability (~0.35)  standard selection has been very efficient because measurement of this phenotype is easy and inexpensive  even for large populations. For body composition  such as breast muscle (BMW) or abdominal fat (AFW) weight  despite a greater heritability (~0.50)  genetic progress has been slower for two reasons: (1) intensity of selection has been lower because of the difficulty and cost to measure these phenotypes  and (2) genetic evaluations have been less accurate because evaluation of candidates is based on information from relatives only. In addition  over the years  the genetic gain for growth has been accompanied by a large increase in carcass fatness []  which itself has a negative impact on both feed efficiency and the environment via a higher excretion of nitrogen and phosphate [–]. Genetic selection against fatness is hindered by the high positive phenotypic correlation between body weight and fat content ( = 0.74) []. For many traits  and more specifically for those under lower selection pressure  genetic variability must still be high within and across chicken populations. This variability has been studied in many different breeds or selected lines for 20 years through quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection (for a review  []). However  information provided by traditional microsatellite-based QTL analyses cannot be used in selection programs because of very large confidence intervals on QTL location. More recently  whole-genome sequencing of multiple chicken breeds has led to the identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  providing very high-density genetic maps compared to the previously low-density microsatellite marker maps []. Despite the poor correlation between growth and body composition performances  it has been possible to divergently select experimental fat (FL) or lean (LL) broiler chicken lines that have different body compositions but quite similar body weights []. A difference in energy metabolism between such divergent lines has been highlighted []. FL chickens generally exhibit lower plasma glucose levels than LL chickens  unlike what is typically observed in obese mammals. Regardless of their nutritional status (fed or fasted)  total plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels are higher in FL than in LL chickens  suggesting a higher rate of hepatic lipogenesis in FL chickens. The plasma level of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) is also higher in FL chickens  possibly because they have more adipocytes in their abdominal fat depot []. Differences have also been reported for several hormones  including IGF1  which has a higher level in plasma in FL than in LL chickens  regardless of the nutritional state []. Previous studies on these lines have determined that alleles of QTL that affect growth and body composition are not fixed in the FL or LL lines [  ]. Using SNPs  the present study aimed at detecting new QTL that affect 17 traits related to growth  body composition and several relevant physiological variables in a FL × LL F population. A medium-density genetic map (1422 markers) was used  which is much lower than what would be obtained with 60 K SNP arrays  and does not allow for linkage disequilibrium analyses  but it is dense enough for fine mapping of QTL using linkage analyses  and the selected markers cover the whole sequenced genome. Different interval mapping strategies were applied using QTLMap software: single-trait analyses with single and multiple QTL on the same chromosome [  ]. A three-generation design was used at the INRA PEAT experimental farm (Nouzilly  Indre-et-Loire) by inter-crossing two experimental meat-type chicken lines  i.e. the fat (FL) and lean (LL) lines  that had been divergently selected for seven generations using the abdominal fat weight/animal weight ratio as an index of fattening  while reaching quite similar live body weights at 9 weeks []. After selection  the two lines were maintained by limiting inbreeding. In the F generation  five FL males were mated to 13 unrelated LL females and four LL males were mated with eight unrelated FL females to generate the F generation. Five F males (three from an FL × LL cross and two from an LL × FL cross) were each mated to nine or 10 unrelated F dams to produce 579 F progeny that were reared in five successive hatching groups. Blood was collected from all chickens for DNA analyses. The F2 chickens were raised under similar conditions (one floor pen per hatch) and fed  using conventional feed: a starter ration from 0 to 3 weeks of age (metabolizable energy: 3050 kcal/kg  crude protein: 220 g/kg  lysine: 12 g/kg  methionine + cystine: 8.5 g/kg  tryptophan: 2.5 g/kg  threonine: 8.3 g/kg  calcium: 11 g/kg  available phosphorus: 4.2 g/kg)  and a grower ration from 4 to 9 weeks of age (metabolizable energy: 3100 kcal/kg  crude protein: 200 g/kg  lysine: 11.3 g/kg  methionine + cystine: 8.22 g/kg  tryptophan: 2.27 g/kg  threonine: 7.38 g/kg  calcium: 8.96 g/kg  available phosphorus: 3.8 g/kg). To synchronize biological and metabolic rhythms  the chickens were maintained under a 14-hour light/10-hour darkness cycle (14L10D)  with lights on from 9 am to 11 pm. Chickens were slaughtered at nine weeks of age and carcasses were eviscerated and stored at 4°C for 20 hours before dissection. All procedures were conducted under Licence No. 37–123 from the Veterinary Services  Indre-et-Loire  France and in accordance with guidelines for Care and Use of Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching (French Agricultural Agency and Scientific Research Agency). Body weight was measured at 1  3  5  7 and 9 weeks of age  i.e. BW1  BW3  BW5  BW7  and BW9  respectively. Body composition traits measured at 9 weeks included breast muscle percentage (BMP)  pectoralis minor (BMWmin) and pectoralis major (BMWmaj) weights  abdominal fat weight (AFW) and percentage (AFP)  thigh weight (ThW) and percentage (ThP)  and shank diameter (ShD) and length (ShL). Weights were expressed in grams. Lengths and diameters were expressed in millimeters. For physiological measurements  blood samples were collected at 7 weeks of age from the wing vein with syringes containing EDTA as anticoagulant  after an overnight fast. To minimize stress  chickens were placed in crates at 4 pm on the day prior to sample collection and lights were turned off. On the day of sampling  chickens were maintained in darkness until body temperature () was measured  and then blood samples were collected and kept on ice.  (in °C) was measured in the cloaca with an electronic thermometer (Testo 110  Testo  Forbach  France) while handling and restraining the chickens gently. The level of fasting plasma glucose (glucose) was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Beckman Analyzer 2  Beckman  Palo Alto  CA) and expressed in mg/dL. The level of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) level was determined with an enzymatic colorimetric kit (Wako  Chemicals  Neuss  Germany) and expressed in mEq/L. Fasting plasma IGF-I levels were measured by radioimmunoassay  as previously described by Enright . [] and expressed and analyzed as pg/10 µl of plasma diluted at a ratio of 1/7. The five F sires were genotyped for a set of 9216 SNPs covering the 28 first autosomes and the GGAZ ( chromosome Z). A subset of 1536 SNPs was selected using MarkerSet software [] based on SNP location and heterozygozity in the F population to maximize both genome coverage and marker informativity. All F animals were genotyped for these 1536 SNPs and for 120 microsatellites that were used in a previous analysis []. SNP genotyping was performed at the National Genotyping Center (CNG  Evry  France) using Illumina GoldenGate technology (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). For microsatellite genotyping  two to 10 markers were combined for multiplex PCR amplification based on size and amplification conditions and analyzed on an automated sequencer (ABI 3700  PE Applied Biosystems  Foster City  CA). The marker length and genotype of the animals were determined using GeneScan and Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems  Version 3.7). Mendelian errors were corrected using the MendelSoft software []. When needed  the GLM procedure of SAS was used to adjust traits for sex and hatch groups (fixed effects) and BW9 (covariate). BW9 was not used as covariate for BW1  BW3  BW5  BW7  ThP and IGF-I. Correlations between adjusted traits were then calculated using the \"cov2cor\" function in R []. The significance level for the bilateral correlation test for more than 500 values and  < 0.01 was 0.115  using the Bravais-Pearson  table. Heritabilities and genetic correlations of the measured traits were estimated by the REML method with the VCE6 software []. The model included the fixed effects of hatch ( = 5) and sex ( = 2)  the animal genetic effect ( = 623)  as well as BW9 as a covariate (except for BW1  BW3  BW5  BW7  ThP and IGF-I  as previously mentioned). For body weight traits  a maternal random effect ( = 47) was added. Genetic locations of the markers were extracted from the international consensus map []. The location of markers that were not included in the consensus map was extrapolated from that of flanking markers. Briefly  considering marker  with flanking markers  and   the local ratio of genetic (cM = centimorgans) to physical (Phy) distance [ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>(cM–cM)/(Phy–Phy)] was used to calculate the genetic location of the marker based on its physical distance from the previous marker cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>cM<U+2009>+<U+2009>[(Phy–Phy)<U+2009>×<U+2009>ratio]. A total of 234 markers had no reliable physical location or presented technical problems (low call rate and/or high Mendelian errors)  so only 1422 of the 1656 markers (1536 SNPs and 120 microsatellites) were selected for the analysis. A linkage QTL interval mapping analysis was performed using the QTLMap software ()  which was developed for outbred experimental populations [  ]  taking into account the familial structure of the population (five half-sib sire families and heteroscedastic model). Fixed and covariate effects were taken into account as previously  i.e. when they were significant at the 5% level in the GLM  and were estimated jointly with the QTL parameters. No assumptions about fixation of alleles in the founder lines and the number of the alleles segregating at QTL were made (i.e. a separate QTL effect was estimated for each sire). This was particularly important with this population  since it has been previously demonstrated that most of the QTL detected  including those that affect abdominal fatness  a highly selected trait  were not fixed in the founder lines [  ]. A fast algorithm was used to estimate transmission probabilities at each location of a chromosome based on the SNP genotypes []  which made it possible to use a large set of markers. A specific GPU accelerated version of QTLMap was used to reduce computation time []. The presence of QTL was assessed using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) under the hypothesis of one versus no QTL linked to a given set of markers []. The QTLMap software was also used to test more complex hypotheses  such as whether two linked QTL influence the same trait []. Two approaches were used for multiple-QTL analysis. When one QTL was identified in a chromosome  the hypothesis of one QTL in the chromosome (H1) was compared to the hypothesis of two QTL in the chromosome (H2). This is of particular interest to test whether a QTL detected in a single-QTL linkage analysis was a ghost  or whether another QTL might be segregating elsewhere on the chromosome. When no QTL was detected for a chromosome by trait combination  the hypothesis of no QTL on the chromosome (H0) was compared to the H2 hypothesis to test for segregation of two antagonistic QTL. In all cases  the two QTL locations under H2 were estimated considering all possible combinations of locations  using a two-dimensional grid. Since the heterogametic sex in chicken is the male  it was possible to perform within-sire family analyses on GGAZ. Confidence intervals of QTL positions were estimated by the drop-off method []. For all QTL analyses  significance thresholds were determined by simulating phenotypes under the null hypothesis of the test to obtain an empirical distribution of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in accordance with the pedigree and marker information. Thus  for the no-versus-one QTL test  phenotypes were simulated under H0  assuming a polygenic model with the trait heritability detailed in Table . For the two-versus-one QTL test  performances were simulated under H1. The most likely location and effect estimated during the no-versus-one QTL test were used to determine the QTL effect on phenotype. The QTL effect used in these simulations was the average of the effects of all heterozygous sires. One thousand and 10 000 (for multiple-QTL and single-QTL analyses  respectively) simulations were performed for each trait by chromosome combinations  and quantiles of maximum LRT were calculated according to Harrel and Davis []. At the position with the highest LRT  the substitution effect of QTL alleles was estimated in each sire family and significance of the effect (difference from 0) was tested by a -test  using the within-family residual standard error  i.e. the intra QTL genotype distribution of the trait adjusted for the other effects in the model (fixed  covariate and polygenic). The additive value of the QTL effect was assessed as the average of significant substitution effects in the sires ( < 0.05). A description of traits  along with Pearson correlation coefficients and estimated genetic correlations between adjusted traits are in Tables  and   respectively. No correlations were presented for BW9 since it was used as covariate to adjust the other traits. Significant ( < 0.01) phenotypic correlations were either higher than 0.115 or lower than -0.115. As expected  correlations between BW measured at different ages were positive  and ranged from 0.21 (for BW1 and BW7) to 0.93 (for BW5 and BW7). Abdominal fatness  expressed either as total weight (AFW) or percentage of BW (AFP)  was negatively phenotypically correlated with several composition traits  i.e. BMP (-0.26)  BMWmaj (-0.3)  ThW (-0.14)  ThP (-0.14)  ShL (-0.24) and ShD (-0.38) and the metabolite glucose (-0.2). Glucose was also negatively correlated with NEFA (-0.20) but positively correlated with body temperature (0.28). No significant correlations were observed for AFW and AFP with BMWmin. ThW and ThP were positively correlated with BMP (0.21) and BMWmaj (0.26) but had no significant correlation with BMWmin (-0.01). ShL was positively correlated with BW3 and BW5  while ShD was negatively correlated with BW1 (-0.17) and BW3 (-0.13). Positive correlations were found between shank and thigh traits (ShL  ShD  ThW and ThP). Finally  white muscle traits (BMP  BMWmaj and BMWmin) were positively correlated with  (0.19) and negatively correlated with plasma IGF-I levels (-0.13). Several phenotypic correlations were confirmed at the genetic level: large positive genetic correlations (ranging from 0.64 to 0.94) were found between BW at the different ages  moderate positive correlations of ShL with BW at 1 to 5 weeks of age (0.39 to 0.49)  and marked negative correlations of abdominal fatness (expressed as weight or percentage) with ShD (-0.62) and plasma glucose (-0.66) (Table ). Significant negative genetic correlations were also found for AFW and AFP with  (-0.58) and with IGF1 (-0.46). BW7 was positively correlated with thigh traits (0.58)  while breast muscle development (BMWmaj and BMP) was positively correlated with ShD (0.46) but negatively with ShL (-0.46). Genetic correlations of NEFA with BW at 5 or 7 weeks of age and with IGF1 were positive and high (ranging from 0.67 to 0.83) but could not be estimated with abdominal fat and breast muscle traits (AFW  AFP and BMWmaj) because of lack of convergence (most probably because of the rather low heritability of NEFA). The distribution of the 1422 markers that were used is detailed in Table . The first 28 autosomes and GGAZ were covered by at least 17 genetic markers  except for GGA16  25 and 27 (3  5 and 13 markers  respectively). Chromosome GGA16 contains the major histocompatibility complex () and many duplications. Since this chromosome is not well covered by genome sequencing  only a few genetic markers are available  all located in an interval of less than 100 kb. Chromosomes 25 and 27 were poorly represented in the initial 9216 SNP set  and most of them were not informative in our population. The average marker interval was 2.1 cM. Since MarkerSet uses SNP locations and heterozygozity information in the F population to maximize genome coverage and marker informativity  the average marker interval was very homogeneous between chromosomes  except again for GGA16 (0 cM) and GGA25 (7.7 cM). This average marker interval was much lower than that obtained when using only microsatellite markers  i.e. 18.7 cM (data not shown); furthermore  it covers almost all chromosomes. The experimental design used for this study was based on large sire families  optimized for linkage analysis. Recent studies in layers have shown that for association analyses  the maximal distance between markers should not exceed 100 kb  and concluded that the Illumina 60 K SNP chip is appropriate for such studies []. Considering that the present study had one marker every 2.1 cM (or about 700 kb)  using association analysis approaches would not be appropriate. Single-QTL analyses led to the identification of 47 QTL that were located on 19 chromosomes and affected all 17 phenotyped traits  except BW1 and BW3 (Table ). A few QTL had both a high chromosome-wide significance ( < 0.001) and a high genome-wide significance ( < 0.05). These QTL affected AFW and AFP (GGA19)  BMWmin (GGA2 and GGAZ)  BMP (GGA9)  ShD (GGA19)  IGF-I (GGA1)   (GGA5) and glucose (GGA18). Other QTL were also highly significant but only at the chromosome-wide level and affected AFP (GGA27   < 0.01)  ThP (GGA8   < 0.01)  and  (GGA11   < 0.01). All other identified QTL had a chromosome-wide significance of  < 0.05. QTL allelic substitution effects ranged from 0.42 (BMWmaj on GGA4  BMWmin on GGA9 and glucose on GGA7) to 1.03 (BMWmin on GGA7) residual standard deviations with a mean of 0.55 standard deviations. Chromosome GGA27 was the best represented  with five identified QTL  followed by GGA3  4  7  19 and 20  which each carried four QTL. The average confidence interval (CI) was equal to 14 cM  with large differences depending on the region (from 2 cM to 36 cM)  mainly due to differences in marker density and informativity. However  the average CI was much smaller compared to the average CI of 32 cM observed for the same population in a study on abdominal fatness and breast muscle weight when using only microsatellites []. QTL that affected growth  body composition and metabolic traits have been extensively studied in the chicken [] and some of the QTL identified in this study had been previously described: AFW on GGA19 []  AFP on GGA19 [] and GGA27 []  BMWmaj and BMWmin on GGA7 []  BW5 on GGA3 [] and GGA4 []  BW7 on GGA4 [] and IGF-I on GGA1 [  ]. However  38 of the 47 QTL identified here have not been described before. Conversely  some QTL that control glucose or NEFA that were previously identified in another chicken population were not observed here []. Multiple-QTL analyses were performed to examine the potential presence of two QTL that segregate on the same chromosome and control the same trait. The results of multiple-QTL analyses are summarized in Table . The test of one-against-two QTL (H1  H2) was first performed. Four pairs of QTL were identified and for each pair  the QTL previously detected under the single-QTL analysis was confirmed and a second QTL was identified. The new QTL on GGA3 at 96 cM that influenced BW5 had a high chromosome-wide significance ( < 0.01)  while the remaining chromosome-wide QTL were significant at  < 0.05. The test of none-against-two QTL (H0  H2) was then examined to test the possibility that two linked QTL located in a short interval might not be detected because of their antagonist effects. Eight new pairs of QTL were identified ( < 0.05) using this test. Together  these two two-QTL analyses (H0  H2 and H1  H2 hypotheses)  identified 20 additional QTL. Their effects ranged from 0.48 (BW3 on GGA18) to 0.93 (BMWmaj on GGA5) standard deviations  with a mean of 0.63 standard deviations. When a QTL was identified at a same location using H1 and H2 hypotheses  their effects were quite similar. Considering only the QTL detected under the H0  H2 hypothesis  the average distance between the two QTL was 59 cM and ranged from 8 to 210 cM. Surprisingly  the two QTL that affected BMP and BW3 on GGA3 were very distant (210 cM and 168 cM  respectively). This may be because estimating two QTL effects together is more powerful and leads to a more precise QTL location []. However  excluding these two pairs of QTL  the average distance between the two QTL was 15 cM  consistent with the hypothesis of two closely located QTL with antagonist effects. Two of the QTL detected under the H0  H2 hypothesis had previously been described in other populations  supporting the validity of the results for BMWmaj on GGA5 [] and BMP on GGA3 []. When determining the threshold under the H1  H2 hypothesis  one QTL was simulated using the location and effect previously identified under the single-QTL analysis. This is quite a conservative test  because if the location and effect were false (i.e. if a ghost QTL was detected under H1)  the H2 hypothesis would likely be rejected. However  the second QTL affecting BW5 identified on GGA3 under this hypothesis was highly significant ( < 0.01)  and has been previously described [  ]. The QTL affecting BW7 and located on GGA4 has also been previously described []. Identification of highly significant QTL that have been previously described in other populations indicates that the results are robust. Many QTL were identified in this study  with intervals that contain for most of them a few dozen genes. From among these positional candidate genes  functional candidate genes were identified using the AnnotQTL web tool [] for QTL regions that were significant at the genome level ( < 0.05). For BMWmin on GGA2 and  on GGA5  none of the described genes had a function that could be linked to the trait. However  many genes are not yet annotated or currently have a functional annotation that is difficult to link to the studied traits. Conversely  on GGA1  a very strong QTL that affects plasma IGF-I level is co-located with the gene that codes for the IGF-I protein. This strongly suggests that a mutation involved in IGF-I expression  putatively in the promoter of the IGF-I gene  could be responsible for the regulation of plasma IGF-I levels in the chicken. This mutation appears to be highly frequent in the population  since four of the five tested males were heterozygous for this QTL. Although the fat and lean chicken lines differ for circulating IGF-I levels at 9 weeks of age (FL > LL  [])  the mutation does not appear to be specific to one of the founder lines  since allele origins were equally shared between the two lines. A similar QTL was previously suggested in an F population that resulted from the cross of chickens with high and low growth rates []. These lines have no common genetic background with the FL and LL lines. Up to 11 QTL for IGF-I plasma level have been described in different mouse strains ([] and references therein) but the most significant QTL has been identified on mouse chromosome 10  where the  gene is located. In mice  circulating IGF-I levels are closely correlated with IGF-I mRNA expression in the liver []. However  an eQTL search conducted on liver samples collected from 282 F mice failed to detect IGF-I cis-eQTL and thus did not support the hypothesis that a mutation in the regulatory regions of  could be responsible for the QTL that influences the level of circulating IGF-I []. Since liver samples were not collected from the FL × LL F population  this hypothesis could not be tested in the present study. On GGA9  a QTL that affects BMP was identified. The gene  ()  previously described as associated with chicken growth  specifically breast muscle weight []  is located in this region. For glucose plasma concentration  a QTL was identified on GGA18. Two genes in this QTL interval could be interesting functional candidates:  () and  (). When overexpressed in transgenic mice   has been described as affecting blood level glucose []. ASPSCR1 interacts with glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4)  but no effect on glucose plasma concentration has been reported. On GGA19  a highly significant novel QTL that affects both AFP and AFW was identified. This region contains the  gene ()  which is involved in fatty acid synthesis. A study of an SNP located in this gene has been found to be associated with fatness traits in chickens []  enhancing the candidate status of this gene. A closer look at these genes might identify putative mutations that could be used for marker-assisted selection in chickens. On this same chromosome  but at a different location  another QTL affected ShD. A possible candidate gene for this QTL is  ()  which is known to affect the fiber type transformation in skeletal muscle []. Finally  a QTL that affects BMWmin was observed on GGAZ. For this region   () could be a good functional candidate gene  since it is involved in the cell cycle and has been described as promoting myogenic differentiation []. While these genes appear to be good functional candidates  it is necessary to identify and validate mutations to confirm their link with the observed QTL. This study enabled us to identify 67 QTL  many of which had not been described before. This result may be explained by the population used and the higher marker density  which increased marker coverage of micro-chromosomes. Because of the lack of markers on most micro-chromosomes in previous studies  only a few QTL had been identified on GGA19  23  24  26 and 28  and none on GGA21  22 and 25 []. In contrast  we identified QTL on GGA21 (NEFA)  GGA19 (AFW  AFP  BMWmin and ShD)  GGA26 (AFW)  and GGA28 (BMP and ShL). In addition to greater genome coverage  the use of a larger set of SNPs made it possible to carry out multiple-QTL analyses and thus to detect many new QTL. This comprehensive study highlights several candidate genes that affect growth and body composition traits in meat-type chickens but further studies are required to confirm their role. Epistatic effects should also be considered  since such interactions have already been described in chicken for growth and body composition traits [  –].

Within- and between-breed genetic diversity need to be assessed to preserve the highest intra-specific variability. Information on genetic diversity and risk status is still lacking for many Creole cattle breeds from the Americas  despite their distinct evolutionary trajectories and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.MethodsA comprehensive genetic analysis of 67 Iberoamerican cattle breeds was carried out with 19 FAO-recommended microsatellites to assess conservation priorities. Contributions to global diversity were investigated using alternative methods  with different weights given to the within- and between-breed components of genetic diversity. Information on Iberoamerican plus 15 worldwide cattle breeds was used to investigate the contribution of geographical breed groups to global genetic diversity.ResultsOverall  Creole cattle breeds showed a high level of genetic diversity with the highest level found in breeds admixed with zebu cattle  which were clearly differentiated from all other breeds. Within-breed kinships revealed seven highly inbred Creole breeds for which measures are needed to avoid further genetic erosion. However  if contribution to heterozygosity was the only criterion considered  some of these breeds had the lowest priority for conservation decisions. The Weitzman approach prioritized highly differentiated breeds  such as Guabalá  Romosinuano  Cr. Patagonico  Siboney and Caracú  while kinship-based methods prioritized mainly zebu-related breeds. With the combined approaches  breed ranking depended on the weights given to the within- and between-breed components of diversity. Overall  the Creole groups of breeds were generally assigned a higher priority for conservation than the European groups of breeds.ConclusionsConservation priorities differed significantly according to the weight given to within- and between-breed genetic diversity. Thus  when establishing conservation programs  it is necessary to also take into account other features. Creole cattle and local isolated breeds retain a high level of genetic diversity. The development of sustainable breeding and crossbreeding programs for Creole breeds  and the added value resulting from their products should be taken into consideration to ensure their long-term survival."

A comprehensive genetic analysis of 67 Iberoamerican cattle breeds was carried out with 19 FAO-recommended microsatellites to assess conservation priorities. Contributions to global diversity were investigated using alternative methods  with different weights given to the within- and between-breed components of genetic diversity. Information on Iberoamerican plus 15 worldwide cattle breeds was used to investigate the contribution of geographical breed groups to global genetic diversity. Overall  Creole cattle breeds showed a high level of genetic diversity with the highest level found in breeds admixed with zebu cattle  which were clearly differentiated from all other breeds. Within-breed kinships revealed seven highly inbred Creole breeds for which measures are needed to avoid further genetic erosion. However  if contribution to heterozygosity was the only criterion considered  some of these breeds had the lowest priority for conservation decisions. The Weitzman approach prioritized highly differentiated breeds  such as Guabalá  Romosinuano  Cr. Patagonico  Siboney and Caracú  while kinship-based methods prioritized mainly zebu-related breeds. With the combined approaches  breed ranking depended on the weights given to the within- and between-breed components of diversity. Overall  the Creole groups of breeds were generally assigned a higher priority for conservation than the European groups of breeds. Conservation priorities differed significantly according to the weight given to within- and between-breed genetic diversity. Thus  when establishing conservation programs  it is necessary to also take into account other features. Creole cattle and local isolated breeds retain a high level of genetic diversity. The development of sustainable breeding and crossbreeding programs for Creole breeds  and the added value resulting from their products should be taken into consideration to ensure their long-term survival. Today  it is estimated that throughout the world  there is one cow for every five people. The most recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on farm animal genetic resources [] illustrates the importance of cattle as a domestic species. Overall  cattle breeds represent about 22% of the documented mammalian livestock breeds  but among these  16% are extinct  16% are threatened and for 30% information on population sizes and number of breeding animals is lacking. This erosion in cattle diversity occurred mainly during the last century for different reasons i.e. commercial breeds were preferred to native populations  crossbreeding led to dilution  and the widespread use of artificial insemination resulted in a sharp decline in sex ratio [  ]. The risk status of each breed is defined on the basis of both demographic and cultural aspects []. For example  the FAO has developed a public database [] as a warning system for worldwide domestic animal genetic resources (AnGR)  in which breeds with less than ~1000 breeding females and/or less than ~20 breeding males are classified as threatened []. As a preservation measure  the European Union provides financial support to livestock producers of native breeds that are considered in risk of abandonment []. Nonetheless  there is general agreement that assessment and preservation of genetic diversity in livestock species are fundamental to meet future breeding needs  to investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and to reconstruct the history of farm animals [  ]. Autosomal microsatellites have been the most used genetic markers to estimate diversity parameters  to investigate breed relationships and to define conservation priorities []. Preservation of 'neutral’ genetic diversity is expected to contribute to maintaining specific breed traits due to natural and artificial selection. Indeed  microsatellites can be present in genes associated with important traits  including adaptation [  ]. Determining the conservation value of breeds is essential to define priorities  including allocation of funds  and to manage extant genetic diversity. Several methods based on the establishment of conservation priorities have been developed to maintain high levels of neutral genetic variation [  ]. The Weitzman approach [] has been widely used in conservation analyses of domestic animal populations (for a review see [])  including cattle [–]. This method uses a matrix of genetic distances as a measure of between-breed diversity and thus puts conservation priorities on the breeds that are more differentiated  i.e. that cause the greatest reduction in branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree when they are removed from the metapopulation. Weitzman [] introduced the concept of marginal diversity to account for the change in expected diversity of a metapopulation (for a given period of time) when the extinction probability of a sub-population increases []. Thus  in the Weitzman approach genetic diversity is maximized if genetically distant breeds (i.e. more unique) are preserved. However  this method has been strongly criticized because it ignores within-breed diversity [    –]. Moreover  breed uniqueness inferred from genetic distances may result from prevalence of rare alleles due to inbreeding  founder effects or strict genetic isolation  instead of a distinct evolutionary history [  ]. Notwithstanding these limitations  it is important to consider that the genetic diversity of a livestock species results from the genetic variation both within- and between-breeds in order to preserve the highest intra-specific variability [    ]. Within-breed diversity is routinely quantified by Nei’s [] expected heterozygosity  but alternative methods based on allelic diversity can also be used [  ]. Strategies that maximize heterozygosity keep the levels of allelic diversity as high as strategies that maximize allelic diversity  while they minimize the levels of inbreeding []. Thus  when prioritizing breeds for conservation  deciding whether genetic or allelic diversity should be considered depends on whether the focus is on short-term (e.g. avoiding inbreeding in highly threatened breeds) or long-term (e.g. future adaptation to changing environments) goals  or on an optimal combination of both (for a discussion see []). In practice  the contribution of each breed to global diversity could be simply estimated as the percentage of gene and/or allelic diversity lost or gained by its removal (as in an extinction scenario) from the metapopulation considered []. However  this would fail to give proper weight to the between-breed component  including the possibility of calculating negative estimates for certain breeds. Given the limitations of the above methods  alternative approaches have been proposed for breed prioritization  which aim at minimizing global molecular coancestry (i.e. inbreeding) considering both within- and between-breed kinship coefficients [      ]. For native European cattle breeds  methods based on molecular kinships have been used to assess their value for conservation decisions [  –    ]. Although genealogical inbreeding is a good predictor of molecular inbreeding  the opposite might not be true and depends highly on the number of genetic markers used to estimate heterozygosity []. Thus  the ideal situation would be to use a combination of pedigree and molecular approaches  but in many cases reliable genealogical data is unavailable. For management purposes  extensions of these methods have been proposed in which acceptable rates of inbreeding and exchange between breeds are defined [  ]. Assuming that both within- and between-breed contributions to genetic diversity should be taken into account to define conservation priorities  various weights applied to each component have been proposed [  –]. For example  Ollivier and Foulley [] used the Weitzman estimate of between-breed diversity weighted by the overall degree of population differentiation  i.e. Wright’s fixation index F[]  combined with the within-breed diversity (measured as the proportional loss in global heterozygosity when a breed is 'lost’) weighted by 1-F. It has been argued that higher weights should be given to the between-breed dimension [] or that the total genetic variance of a hypothetical trait should be considered []  but no consensus has been reached on a single method. Cañon et al. [] carried out a comparative analysis to assess conservation priorities in a comprehensive study of Iberian native cattle  using several of the above-mentioned methods. While their study did not make any definite recommendation  it provided a wide perspective on how genetic variation is distributed among peripheral and more variable breeds  which can be helpful for decision-makers to carry out conservation programs. Several studies have aimed at characterizing the genetic diversity of worldwide cattle (for a review see []). However  in many cases different marker panels were used and the number of breeds was limited  thus a large-scale comparison of the results  both in terms of genetic diversity and conservation priorities  was difficult. Europe and the Americas  including both North and Latin America  hold about 47% of the worldwide cattle population []. In Europe  local breeds are recognized as important AnGR and information on their genetic diversity and risk status is generally available. However  for many populations of Creole cattle from Latin America  such information essential for conservation purposes is lacking  in spite of their distinct evolutionary trajectories and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. Previously  we reported data on the genetic diversity and breed structure of Creole cattle using FAO-recommended microsatellite markers []  based on a large dataset of Iberoamerican cattle and other European and Indicine breeds. In the present study  we conducted a comprehensive analysis of conservation priorities of Creole cattle  with the aim of assessing their value for conservation decisions and management of animal genetic resources. Overall  data on more than 80 worldwide bovine breeds was used to investigate the contribution of different geographical breed groups to the global genetic diversity of cattle. We analyzed 3383 animals belonging to 82 populations of Iberoamerican cattle that included British  Continental European and Indicine breeds from 12 countries. Animals were sampled within the framework of the BIOBOVIS consortium [] according to recommended procedures for the collection of biological specimens (blood  semen or hair roots) from cattle. Details on the sampling procedures and breed distributions are reported elsewhere [  –]. International and country regulations regarding experimental research on animals were strictly followed. Based on previous results [    ]  relationships between cattle breeds were used to establish 13 major breed groups [for details see Additional file : Table S1]. Conservation analyses based on geographical distributions and distinct breed types (e.g. taurine  indicine and crossbred) were performed. Specifically  Creole cattle of the Americas (907 animals; 27 breeds) were distributed into six major groups: Creole1 (175 animals; 4 breeds)  cattle from the southern region of South America that are related to Iberian breeds and partly to African cattle; Creole2 (121; 4)  cattle populations from Colombia and Paraguay admixed with British breeds; Creole3 (50; 2)  Colombian cattle related to Iberian breeds; Creole4 (61; 2)  cattle from Panama  possibly with some influence from African zebu; Creole5 (212; 6)  mostly Mexican cattle admixed with Continental European breeds and also with zebu; and Creole6 (288; 9)  cattle from central America extensively admixed with zebu. Iberian breeds were separated into four groups: Iberian1 (609; 12)  most of the Portuguese breeds; Iberian2 (452; 10)  Spanish and Portuguese breeds that are known to have been admixed with commercial European breeds; Iberian3 (100; 2)  breeds from the Canary Islands; and Iberian4 (763; 16)  most of the Spanish breeds. For comparison purposes  we also analyzed other breeds that are known to have influenced the Creole cattle of the Americas and that were classified into three groups: British (200; 5)  includes mainly commercial breeds of British origin; Continental Europe (184; 4)  commercial breeds that originate from Continental Europe; and Indicine ( 168; 6)  widely spread zebu breeds. We used a microsatellite dataset previously generated by the BIOBOVIS research consortium []  which is available to the scientific community from a public database []. All animals were genotyped with a panel of 19 microsatellite loci:                                     and . These loci are distributed across 17 cattle autosomes and are recommended by the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) / Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Advisory Committee for genetic diversity studies. The genotyping and allele standardization procedures have been validated and are described in detail in []. Estimates of within-breed genetic diversity were obtained with GENETIX 4.05.2 software []  namely observed (H) and unbiased expected (H) heterozygosities  mean number of alleles (MNA) per breed and geographical breed group. This software was also used to estimate  statistics according to Weir and Cockerham []. Allelic richness (R) over all loci per breed was calculated with FSTAT v. 2.9.3 software []. Analysis of conservation priorities depends on how the metapopulation is defined to investigate partial contributions to global genetic diversity. Also  breed prioritization will vary considerably according to the relative importance of the within- and between-breed components of genetic diversity in each breed and to the genetic relationships among breeds. Given the extensive collection of cattle specimens available for this study and for the sake of simplicity  we took into consideration two dimensions that were analyzed separately i.e.  (1) the 27 Creole cattle populations and (2) the 13 major geographical breed groups defined above. From the perspective of practical applications  we chose to consider geographical breed groups with their specificities  rather than the complete worldwide distribution of cattle included in a single metapopulation. For the conservation analyses  we followed the methods described by Cañon et al. [] and outlined below. For a better understanding of the statistical procedures involved  we categorized the different approaches as follows: methods that aim at minimizing the overall kinship coefficient of the metapopulation (kinship-based methods)  a method that reflects only the between-breed diversity component (Weitzman approach) and combined approaches that take into consideration both the within- and between-breed components of global genetic diversity. We applied the Core Set methods of Eding et al. [] to investigate the population contributions to global diversity that account for within- and between-breed kinship coefficients by minimizing the overall kinship coefficient of the metapopulation considered and eliminating the genetic overlap between breeds in the core set []. Estimation of possible negative contributions by a given population is avoided through an iterative process that gives the lowest value a zero and recalculates the contributions after removal of the population. In the absence of genealogical data  kinships were estimated from molecular data with different methods: (1) marker-estimated kinships (MEK) obtained from individual genotypes  as described by Eding and Meuwissen []; (2) a variation of the MEK method based on log-linear regressions [] obtained with the weighted log-linear model (WLM); (3) same as (2) but the log-linear regressions were obtained with the mixed model (WLMM); and (4) average molecular coancestries () based on allele frequencies []. MEK were estimated with a macro function in Excel []  whereas the solutions for WLM and WLMM were obtained with matrices built with the MATLAB® software (The MathWorks  Inc.  USA). Average coancestry coefficients within () and between () each Creole breed and geographical breed group were calculated with the MOLKIN3 software []. Analyses of conservation priorities based on these similarity matrices (MEK  WLM  WLMM and ) were carried-out with a FORTRAN program developed and kindly shared by Eding and Meuwissen. We derived pairwise kinship distances from the MEK coefficients following Eding et al. [] as: d() =  +  - 2. Kinship genetic distances were used to construct the neighbor-net phylogenies of the Creole breeds and geographical breed groups with the SPLITS TREE4 4.12.6 software []. Genetic relationships were used to classify the Creole breeds and groups of breeds- and then to build contour plots of kinship coefficients (MEK and ) with the MATLAB® software (The MathWorks  Inc.  USA). In order to assess within-breed genetic diversity directly  the partial contributions of each Creole breed and each geographical breed group were also calculated as the proportional variation in expected heterozygosity of the metapopulation after removal of each breed or breed group (PC). We calculated the partial contributions (PC) of each Creole breed and each geographical breed group to the total genetic diversity using the Weitzman method []. Here  Reynolds genetic distances [] were used as a measure of between-breed diversity  while within-breed diversity was ignored. This approach estimates the reduction in length of the branches in a maximum likelihood phylogeny after removal of a population []. PC were calculated with the FORTRAN program developed by Garcia et al. []. An alternative approximation algorithm developed by Garcia et al. [] was also used to analyze the 13 geographical breed groups. Thresholds ranging from 0.550 to 0.001 were tested to verify the coherence of the results. Pairwise Reynolds genetic distances were calculated with the POPULATIONS 1.2.32 software [] and used to obtain neighbor-net phylogenies of the Creole breeds and geographical breed groups built with the SPLITS TREE4 4.12.6 software []. Ideally  analyses of conservation priorities should take into account both within- and between-population genetic variability in order to make more accurate management decisions. We used three approaches to calculate contributions that combine these two levels of the global diversity of the metapopulation: (1) aggregate diversity (PC) []  which uses Wright’s F to weight the between- and (1-F) to weigh the within-population components of diversity i.e.  PC = * + *(1-); (2) the approach of Piyasatian and Kinghorn []  which gives a weight five times higher to the between-population component (PC)  such that PC = * + *(–); and (3) the method proposed by Caballero and Toro [] and Fabuel et al. []  which gives equal weights to within-population coancestries and genetic distances. In this case  Nei’s minimum distances [] were used and calculations were done with MOLKIN3 software []. Results are organized according to the two dimensions defined above i.e.  the 27 Creole cattle populations and the 13 geographical breed groups [see Additional file : Table S1]. Summary statistics that describe the genetic diversity within the Creole cattle breeds and the geographical breed groups are in Tables  and   respectively. With a few exceptions  Creole breeds had a high level of genetic diversity (on average  H = 0.719±0.053  H = 0.739±0.049  MNA = 6.95±1.52 and R = 4.71±1.1). Among the Creole cattle  the Creole1 and Creole3 groups of breeds that are related to Iberian or British breeds and also to African cattle  showed intermediate to high levels of genetic diversity (on average  H > 0.671±0.123 and H > 0.708±0.116)  while the Creole breeds admixed with zebu cattle (Creole5 and Creole6) had high values across all estimates (on average  H > 0.712±0.091  H > 0.777±0.079  MNA > 10.84±2.34 and R > 4.92±1.17). The neighbor-net phylogeny of kinship distances (Figure a) shows the relationships among the Creole breeds. Interestingly  this phylogeny was similar to that derived from more traditional genetic distances (e.g. Reynolds distances []). Creole cattle from the southern regions of South America (Cr. Patagonico  Cr. Argentino and Cr. Uruguayo) were clustered together with long branch lengths  like the Colombian breeds Romosinuano and Costeño con Cuernos on one side  and Guabalá and Guaymí from Panama on the other. These breeds all share ancestral signatures of Iberian and African cattle []. The Caracú breed from Brazil and the Texas Longhorn breed from the United States were also clustered together in agreement with their common Iberian ancestry. Clearly  the Creole breeds Siboney  Cr. Cubano  Velasquez  Cr. Ecuatoriano  Cr. Pilcomayo  Caqueteño  Cr. Chiapas  Chino Santandereano  Cr. Casanareño  and Sanmartinero that clustered together share some common ancestry with zebu; they are known to have been crossed with indicine cattle. The majority of the Creole breeds from Mexico clustered together  whereas three breeds from Colombia (Blanco Orejinegro  Lucerna and Hartón del Valle) that have been crossed with commercial British cattle formed another cluster.  The genetic relationships among 27 Creole cattle breeds  and 13 geographical breed groups  are shown; breed acronyms are defined as follows: CRA  Cr.Argentino; PAT  Cr. Patagonico; CAR  Caracú; CRU  Cr. Uruguayo; BON  Blanco Orejinegro; HVA  Hartón del Valle; LUC  Lucerna; PCH  Pampa Chaqueño; CCC  Costeño con Cuernos; RMS  Romosinuano; GUA  Guabalá; GUY  Guaymí; SMA  Sanmartinero; CBC  Cr. Baja California; CHU  Cr. Chihuahua; CNY  Cr. Nayarit; CPO  Cr. Poblano; TLH  Texas Longhorn; CAQ  Caqueteño; CHS  Chino Santandereano; CAS  Cr. Casanareño; VEL  Velasquez; CUB  Cr. Cubano; SIB  Siboney; ECU  Cr. Ecuatoriano; CHI  Cr. Chiapas; PIL  Cr. Pilcomayo. The neighbor-net graph of geographical breed clusters in Figure b that was derived from kinship distances illustrates these distinct admixture patterns found in Creole cattle. For example  Creole3  which includes the Costeño con Cuernos and Romosinuano breeds (from Colombia)  clustered with cattle from the Canary islands of Iberian ancestry  whereas Creole2 was closely associated with commercial breeds of British origin. The levels of within-breed diversity can also be assessed using kinship coefficients with either the MEK obtained from individual genotypes or average coancestries () estimated from allele frequencies. Because of the poor quality of the extracted DNA  possibly due to inappropriate hair collection (e.g. insufficient hair roots and/or inadequate preservation)  no results were obtained for      and  loci in the 35 Cr. Casanareño specimens. Therefore  this breed was excluded from the calculation of allelic richness and from average coancestry analyses because absence of genotyping data for one breed prevents the MOLKIN software from generating complete results for the other breeds (namely between-breed coancestries of Cr. Casanareño and the other Creole populations). In order to visualize both within- and between-breed kinships  contour plots were drawn in which populations were sorted according to their genetic proximity defined in the phylogenetic neighbor-net graph (Figure a and [see Additional file : Figure S1a]). Red areas represent highly inbred Creole breeds i.e. Guabalá (MEK = 0.221 and  = 0.354); Blanco Orejinegro (MEK = 0.191 and  = 0.319); Cr. Patagonico (MEK = 0.215 and  = 0.339); Cr. Uruguayo (MEK = 0.205 and  = 0.335); Cr. Argentino (MEK = 0.209 and  = 0.330); Romosinuano (MEK = 0.206 and  = 0.344); and Costeño con Cuernos (MEK = 0.210 and  = 0.344)  while yellow areas represent breeds with intermediate kinship values i.e. Caracú (MEK = 0.163 and  m = 0.300)  Lucerna (MEK = 0.162 and  m = 0.302) and Sanmartinero (MEK = 0.152 and  m = 0.300).  Creole cattle breeds  and geographical breed groups  were classified according to their respective kinship phylogenies; breed acronyms are defined as follows:<U+2009>CRA  Cr.Argentino; PAT  Cr. Patagonico; CAR  Caracú; CRU  Cr. Uruguayo; BON  Blanco Orejinegro; HVA  Hartón del Valle; LUC  Lucerna; PCH  Pampa Chaqueño; CCC  Costeño con Cuernos; RMS  Romosinuano; GUA  Guabalá; GUY  Guaymí; SMA  Sanmartinero; CBC  Cr. Baja California; CHU  Cr. Chihuahua; CNY  Cr. Nayarit; CPO  Cr. Poblano; TLH  Texas Longhorn; CAQ  Caqueteño; CHS  Chino Santandereano; CAS  Cr. Casanareño; VEL  Velasquez; CUB  Cr. Cubano; SIB  Siboney; ECU  Cr. Ecuatoriano; CHI  Cr. Chiapas; PIL  Cr. Pilcomayo. These contour plots also reveal breed relationships with related breeds clustered in different yellow and green areas  i.e. Guabalá and Guaymí; Blanco Orejinegro  Lucerna and Texas Longhorn; Blanco Orejinegro  Cr. Patagonico  Cr. Uruguayo and Cr. Argentino; Blanco Orejinegro and Sanmartinero; and Romosinuano  Costeño con Cuernos and Sanmartinero. Finally  zebu-influenced breeds in dark blue areas (Caqueteño  Velasquez  Cr. Cubano  Siboney  Cr. Ecuatoriano and Cr. Pilcomayo) are clearly separated from all others. The geographical breed clusters with the highest within-group kinship values (red areas in Figure b and [see Additional file : Figure S1b]) were Creole3 (MEK = 0.200 and  = 0.297)  which includes the threatened Colombian breeds Costeño con Cuernos and Romosinuano  and Iberian3 (MEK = 0.172 and  = 0.271)  which includes two isolated breeds from the Canary Islands. Interestingly  the group of Indicine breeds  mainly composed of widely spread commercial zebu cattle  also had high kinship coefficients (MEK = 0.167 and  = 0.272)  which suggests the existence of a substructure within this group. Fairly high kinship coefficients were observed between Iberian1 (mostly Portuguese breeds) and Iberian2 (mostly Spanish breeds)  between the Continental European group and Iberian2  and between Iberian3 (Canary Islands) and Creole3 (Colombia)  as shown by the yellow areas in Figure b. Overall  the separation was greatest between the group of Zebu-influenced breeds in dark blue areas and the remaining groups followed by the separation between Creole6 and Creole4 with a higher degree of zebu admixture in light blue areas. The results of the analyses of conservation priorities of Creole breeds are in Tables  and . The kinship-based methods  namely MEKs   and WLM  resulted in a considerable number of Creole breeds with a null contribution to the overall genetic diversity (15  14 and 17 breeds  respectively  out of 27). Consequently  only highly prioritized breeds can be easily identified i.e. Siboney  Cr. Cubano  Pampa Chaqueño and Cr. Poblano (0.109 < MEKs < 0.215  0.100 <  < 0.251 and 0.052 < WLM <0.214) and the results were similar with the three methods applied. These may reflect the high within-breed genetic diversity of these breeds  possibly due to past crossbreeding. The WLMM method  which allows only one null contribution (in this case the Creole Blanco Orejinegro)  separated breeds more effectively and prioritized for conservation the Casanareño  Siboney  Cr. Cubano  Velasquez and Cr. Ecuatoriano breeds (0.56 < WLMM < 0.107). Nevertheless  the contrasting results for the Casanareño breed (MEK = 0  no data for  and high WLM and WLMM) must be interpreted with caution  because of the lack of results for four loci in this breed  as explained above. The breeds Pampa Chaqueño  Cr. Nayarit  Caracú  and Cr. Chiapas had intermediate conservation values (0.042 < WLMM < 0.048). The proportional contribution of each breed to the average heterozygosity of the metapopulation  resulted in many negative values (10 breeds)  which  if these breeds were removed  would lead to a 'gain’ in diversity. In accordance with their inbred status (high within-breed kinship coefficients)  the breeds Guabalá  Romosinuano  Cr. Patagonico and Costeño con Cuernos had the most negative PC values (between -0.411 and -0.357). This method ranked breeds with greater H values at a higher level  such as Cr. Nayarit  Caqueteño  Hartón del Valle  Cr. Chiapas and Cr. Chihuahua (0.196 < PC < 0.252). The breeds Chino Santandereano  Cr. Poblano  Cr. Ecuatoriano  Pampa Chaqueño  Velasquez and Cr. Pilcomayo had intermediate contributions (0.152 < PC < 0.192). Although Cr. Casanareño was excluded from the coancestry analysis  it resulted in a null MEK contribution and was highly prioritized by the WLM and WLMM as a consequence of having a significant effect (~14%) in the overall heterozygosity of Creole cattle. The Weitzman approach prioritizes highly differentiated breeds (i.e. those with large genetic distances from all others) based only on their contribution to between-breed genetic diversity. In this case  breeds with the highest contributions (5.39 < PC < 9.88) were Guabalá  Romosinuano  Cr. Patagonico  Siboney and Caracú followed by Costeño con Cuernos  Cr. Uruguayo and Cr. Argentino (5.38 < PC < 4.97). Mexican breeds had the lowest contributions amongst all breeds (< 2%). The combined approach of Ollivier and Foulley [] (PC)  which takes into account both within- and between-breed components of the genetic diversity  seems to provide more balanced solutions. In this case  the between-breed component (i.e. PC) was weighted by the overall F value of 0.087 obtained for the metapopulation of Creole breeds. The PC approach prioritized Creole breeds that also ranked high with the kinship-based methods (i.e. with high within-breed diversity)  namely Siboney  Cr. Cubano  Velasquez and Cr. Nayarit (0.385 < PC < 0.579). Nevertheless  some of the breeds prioritized by PC (i.e with greater genetic distances) also had high PC estimates  particularly Guabalá  Caracú and the above mentioned Siboney (0.337 < PC < 0.579). Creole breeds Chino Santandereano  Cr. Ecuatoriano  Cr. Chiapas  Caqueteño  Pampa Chaqueño  Hartón del Valle and Guaymí had intermediate conservation values (0.310 < PC < 0.378). The PC method gave the same results in terms of breed ranking for conservation priorities as the Weitzman approach. The results of the combined approach of Caballero and Toro [] and Fabuel et al. [] are in Table . The Texas Longhorn breed had the greatest contribution to global coancestry (  0.019) because its within-breed coancestry was quite high ( = 0.266) and its distance from all the other populations was among the lowest observed (D = 0.064). The breeds Cr. Argentino  Caracú and Cr. Uruguayo also had high contributions to  (0.014  0.012 and 0.011  respectively) as a consequence of their high  values (between 0.300 and 0.329). Although the Cr. Patagonico  Guabalá  Costeño con Cuernos and Romosinuano breeds had high  values (between 0.339 and 0.354)  their mean genetic distances were also rather large (between 0.106 and 0.127) and thus their contributions to  obtained from the difference between  and D were less significant (0.009  0.007  0.007 and 0.006  respectively). The Texas Longhorn breed had the highest contribution to D (0.073) and to proportional contribution estimates (PC  9.060)  but these estimates can be biased as a consequence of the rather large sample size of this population (N = 80)  which is taken into account in all calculations. This could also be valid for the PC estimates of the breeds Siboney (6.123)  Cr. Cubano (5.999)  Pampa Chaqueño (5.884) e Cr. Argentino (5.430)  which also had large samples sizes. Indeed  when the proportional contributions to genetic diversity are estimated by ignoring sample sizes (PC)  only the Siboney and Cr. Cubano breeds maintain their high ranking (4.108 and 4.025  respectively)  followed by Cr. Chiapas (4.001)  Cr. Nayarit (3.987) and Velasquez (3.981). The Caracú  Cr. Poblano  Cr. Uruguayo  Cr. Pilcomayo  Guaymí and Cr. Patagonico breeds had quite high proportional contributions to genetic diversity (3.813 < PC <5.321)  whereas Cr. Ecuatoriano had the lowest contribution (PC = 1.414)  perhaps because of its low representation (N = 12). The proportional contribution of each breed to a pool of maximum genetic diversity showed very little variation among Creole breeds  but removal of the Siboney and Cr. Cubano breeds from the metapopulation of Creole cattle caused the greatest loss in total genetic diversity (-0.6% and -0.4%  respectively). The results of the analyses of conservation priorities of geographical breed-groups are in Tables  and . With the kinship-based methods (MEKs    WLM and WLMM)  the breed groups Creole6 (zebu-influenced)  Indicine  British and Iberian4 (most Spanish breeds) were highly prioritized (0.064 < MEKs < 0.427  0.056 <  < 0.402  0.049 < WLM <0.546  0.087 < WLMM < 0.257) because of the rather high within-group genetic diversity which reflects their heterogeneous genetic make-up. Based on the MEKs and  estimates  Creole3 (Costeño con Cuernos and Romosinuano breeds from Colombia) had an intermediate conservation value (0.053 and 0.066  respectively). Similarly  with WLM and WLMM  the Iberian3 (breeds from the Canary Islands) and Continental European (WLM = 0.033 and WLMM = 0.076  respectively) breed groups had an intermediate position. As expected  PC estimates resulted in negative contributions for eight of the 13 geographical breed groups and prioritized Creole6  Creole2  Creole5  Iberian4 and Continental European cattle (0.041 < PC < 0.694) for conservation. Indicine cattle had a particularly high Weitzman estimate (PC = 27.16) which reflected their wide phylogenetic differentiation. This approach also prioritized Creole3 (16.53) and Creole4 (14.22)  whereas Iberian3 and Creole1 had more intermediate values (9.90 and 6.25  respectively). The strong differentiation of these geographical breed groups is confirmed by their large genetic distances  as shown [see Additional file : Figure S2]. Given the inherent limitations of the Weitzman procedure  especially when the number of breeds is large  the alternative approximation algorithm of Garcia et al. [] was also tested with the 13 geographical breed groups [see Additional file : Figure S3] to investigate the partial contributions of each breed to genetic diversity. Our results indicate that the approximate estimates of Weitzman and exact methods are in full agreement only for thresholds between 0.300 and 0.200. Furthermore  these results suggest that it would not be practical to carry this type of analysis of conservation priorities of worldwide cattle at the breed level (too many breeds  too computationally demanding)  even if the approximate method is used. These results provide additional support to our approach that considers geographical breed groups instead of individual breeds. The strategy based on the analysis of breed groups produced an overall F value of 0.048  which was used in the formula of Ollivier and Foulley [] (PC = * + *0.952) to calculate conservation values. With this method  well-differentiated breed groups such as Indicine and Creole6 were prioritized (1.083 and 0.873  respectively)  but Creole4  Creole5 and Creole2 also ranked high (0.372 < PC < 0.567). According to this method  Iberian2 (a group of Iberian breeds with a recognized admixed background) had the lowest conservation value (0.097). Both Piyasatian and Kinghorn [] and Weitzman approaches gave the same results in terms of ranking of conservation priorities  as shown in the analysis of individual Creole breeds. The results of the combined approach of Caballero and Toro [] and Fabuel et al. [] for the geographical breed groups are in Table . Contributions to global coancestry were high for Iberian4  Iberian1 and Iberian2 (between 0.028 and 0.038)  whereas they were moderate for the British  Creole5  Creole6 and Continental European groups (about 0.012). Their contributions to D were also high (between 0.051 and 0.183) due to their lower average Nei’s minimum distances. Accordingly  the above-mentioned Iberian breed groups were highly prioritized when samples sizes were considered (13.117 < PC < 22.623). Indicine and Creole6 had the most negative impact on overall genetic diversity when they were removed from the metapopulation (GDT|I = 0.787  loss/gain = -1.0% and GDT|I = 0.790  loss/gain = -0.6%  respectively). When the proportional contributions to genetic diversity were estimated ignoring sample sizes (PC)  Indicine  Creole6  Creole5  Iberian4  Creole2 and British breed groups ranked highest (7.715 < PC < 8.174). The need for conservation of genetic resources for food and agriculture is widely recognized []  but the existence of organized programs for the conservation of domestic animal breeds differs considerably between countries. With a few exceptions  e.g. [–]  systematic conservation actions have been taken for Creole cattle breeds (but not all) only in the last few years []. While several Creole breeds are considered 'not at risk’ according to the FAO risk categories (Table )  no information on the number of breeding animals and on their population trend is available for most of these breeds. Creole populations are descendants of Iberian cattle brought to the Americas nearly five centuries ago []; the process of separation and divergence of these populations with many generations of genetic drift has probably determined their retention of genetic diversity and adaptation to a very wide range of environmental conditions []. However  many of these Creole breeds have been abandoned or extensively crossed with commercial European and zebu breeds and conservation programs are necessary to avoid further losses of genetic diversity. In many cases  a conservation program will concern many breeds while financial resources are limited  thus the need to set priorities. Factors that need to be considered when defining such priorities include the importance of a breed in terms of genetic uniqueness but also its own genetic diversity  and other aspects such as adaptation to specific environments  possession of unique traits  cultural and historical value  contribution to environmental sustainability  etc. []. Once priorities have been established  different conservation strategies can be applied  namely  or  preservation  and cryoconservation  which differ in their ability to address the different aspects considered in the rationale for conservation []. Although other factors that can potentially impact conservation decisions are important  knowledge of the population structure of a livestock species in terms of distribution of genetic variability within- and between-breeds is a key factor to establish conservation priorities and strategies []  that aim at maintaining genetic diversity for future generations []. Previous studies [      ] have confirmed that Creole breeds retain high levels of genetic diversity  and that they differ considerably from each other and from their Iberian ancestors. Some of this diversity may result from admixture with exotic germplasm in a number of Creole breeds  such as those from Cuba and Ecuador  which have been influenced by admixture from zebu cattle over the last century []. Our results indicate that under different conservation perspectives  the groups of Creole breeds generally had a higher conservation priority than Iberian  British or Continental European breed groups (Tables  and ). This may reflect the strong selection pressure and consequent loss of genetic diversity of commercial European breeds over the years  such as those included in the British and Continental European breed groups  whereas herdbooks and organized breeding programs have only recently been adopted for a few Creole breeds. Among the Creole breeds  conservation priorities depended on whether the method used placed more emphasis on the contribution of each breed to the within- or the between-breed component of genetic diversity. Thus  if the focus was on breed distinctiveness  priority was given to most breeds classified in breed groups Creole1 (breeds from Argentina  Brazil and Uruguay)  Creole3 (two breeds from Colombia) and Creole4 (breeds from Panama)  whereas if the focus was on within-breed diversity  priority was given to breeds from Creole2 (three breeds from Colombia and one from Paraguay)  Creole5 (most Mexican breeds) and Creole6 (two breeds from Cuba  one from Ecuador  one from Mexico  and most Colombian breeds). Finally  for individual Creole breeds  the contribution to genetic diversity based on average coancestries combined with genetic distances (Table )  generally prioritized breeds that are thought to have the highest degree of zebu admixture (Creole5 and Creole6). The difficulties associated with the choice of the best method to prioritize breeds for conservation decisions were recently discussed in several papers [      ] and are illustrated by our results. For example  Martinez et al. [] reported that the highly-threatened Guabalá is a Creole breed with strong signatures of Iberian ancestry. However  in our study  it had the lowest levels of genetic diversity  the highest within-breed coancestry  and the highest average Nei’s distance (Tables  and ). Thus  including the Guabalá breed among those prioritized for conservation depended highly on the criteria used for breed ranking  i.e. it was classified as a top priority when the focus was on between-breed diversity (such as in the Weitzman procedure)  but was the first breed to be excluded when only the within-breed component of genetic diversity was considered (proportional contribution to H). This is in line with previous findings [  ] that indicate that small  inbred breeds will be given priority when the emphasis is placed on the between-breed component. This result invalidates the use of the Weitzman approach  based on genetic distances  as a single measure for breed prioritization. In contrast  higher ranking will be given to large  and possibly crossbred  populations when the emphasis is placed on the within-breed component []. Nevertheless  when other methods are used  the ranking of Guabalá depends on the weight given to each component of the overall genetic diversity  i.e. it has a low conservation value with kinship-based methods (Table ) because of its high inbreeding but it is highly ranked with methods that give greater weight to the between-breed component such as the Piyasatian and Kinghorn approach []. When analyzing the genetic diversity of Iberian cattle  Cañon et al. [] were faced with the same difficulty  i.e. that the more a breed was differentiated (e.g. Mirandesa) the more likely it had undergone strong genetic drift and showed high levels of inbreeding. Thus  classifying such breeds among the top priorities for conservation decisions depended on the strategy followed  although they constitute reservoirs of rare alleles. This pattern of genetic variation distribution is typical of sub-divided populations in which the global genetic diversity of the species is maintained at the cost of a loss in the genetic variability of the sub-populations. Overall  the choice of the most appropriate method to prioritize breeds for conservation decisions is determined by whether it is important to maintain genetic diversity for the short- or long-term. For example  if the focus is on short-term objectives  the emphasis should be placed on maintaining high levels of heterozygosity  while if it is on long-term objectives  the emphasis should be placed on allelic richness and breed differentiation []. In the particular case of Creole cattle  for which distinct evolutionary trajectories and selection for adaptation to extreme environments have played a major role  the preservation of high levels of allelic diversity is a key element for their long-term preservation and for maintaining their ability to cope and adjust to future environmental changes. Furthermore  in addition to establishing conservation priorities among candidate breeds  it may be important to carry out similar analyses on a within-breed basis to define conservation priorities among different herds  strains  etc.  which may be particularly important in breeds with a pronounced substructure []. One key issue  which is well-exemplified in the case of Creole cattle  is how misleading the exclusive consideration of high heterozygosity might be  and how it should be carefully assessed and interpreted. For example  several of the Creole breeds included in our study are known to have been admixed with zebu cattle in the beginning of the 20th century  and show strong signs of this influence [  ]. As expected  breeds with zebu admixture (which are mainly included in the Creole6 breed group) have the highest levels of heterozygosity (Table )  and thus are often classified as the top priority for conservation decisions (Tables  and ). Indeed  this is also in the case in the analyses of the geographical breed groups  which classify Creole6 and Indicine as the top priorities for conservation with most of the methods used (Table ). These results reinforce the idea that statistical analyses aimed at making conservation decisions are useful but should be considered carefully  since there is a risk that some breeds or breed groups may be ignored in conservation programs. Thus  such decisions must take into account additional factors  including the results of other methods such as cluster and admixture analyses. One example of an ancillary method is the estimation of marginal kinship-based diversities per breed []  which take into account extinction probabilities  to measure the expected loss of diversity within a defined time interval. Given the difficulties with estimating valid extinction probabilities [] for most of the Creole breeds  for which the risk status is largely unknown  we chose not to include this approach in our analyses but recognize its relevance to conservation studies. The establishment of conservation priorities based only on 'neutral’ genetic markers  such as microsatellites  can fail to take into account important genetic information associated with phenotypic variation (e.g. morphology or production traits)  disease resistance  and other adaptive traits. Starting with a few  animals imported from Iberia since the 15 century []  Creole cattle expanded throughout the Americas and adapted to environmental conditions ranging from the Chihuahua desert to Patagonia  or from the tropical climate of the Caribbean to the Chilean Andes. Natural selection probably played a major role in the adaptation to these novel and diverse environmental niches and in the differentiation of Creole subpopulations. When compared to other taurine breeds  Creole breeds have been shown to have better heat tolerance [  ]  greater resistance to ticks [  ] and to Tropical Ox Warble []  lower incidence of anaplasmosis []  better immune response []  greater docility and more desirable grazing behavior []  higher fertility and longevity []  and higher productivity under given conditions []. This resilience can be of extreme importance in a world facing climate changes []. Whole-genome approaches using next-generation sequencing have been developed for livestock species  particularly cattle  which allow identification of genomic regions under selection [–]. Because a high number of genetic markers in coding and non-coding genomic regions can be used (e.g. SNPs)  such a genomic approach can provide more reliable estimates of inbreeding coefficients when pedigree information is lacking  as well as more accurate measures of genetic diversity and of the conservation value of the different breeds []. Thus  and following recent FAO guidelines for the  preservation of AnGR []  it is important to investigate furthermore and carefully evaluate the usefulness of whole-genome SNPs to define conservation priorities of genetically distinct breeds of Creole cattle in addition to the microsatellite-based inferences reported in this study. Creole breeds have a particular evolutionary history that can be crucial to better understand the genetic basis of adaptation because  from a small number of animals originally brought from the Iberian peninsula []  Creole cattle populations have adapted to very distinct environmental conditions  spreading from Texas to Patagonia. Thus  it can be expected that Creole cattle carry specific genetic signatures of genomic regions under selection  and genome sequencing will be extremely useful to identify these regions. Prior to applying the conservation priority principles discussed here on a large scale  it is essential that a better and more extensive sampling is carried out  particularly for more endangered breeds  and that a general agreement is reached on the specific criteria to be used in the definition of priorities. Besides factors directly associated with genetic diversity  which have been the subject of our study  other aspects such as the contribution of a breed to food security and economic return  the demography and risk status  the existence of unique traits or specific adaptation features  the historical and cultural values  the contribution to sustainable development and environmental balance  etc.  should also be taken into account []. The end result may be an index combining the different ranking criteria weighted appropriately to establish conservation priorities  as outlined by the FAO [  ]. In any case  the consensus is that the best way to ensure the survival of a breed is to make its use more profitable and appealing to producers. The development of sustainable utilization and organized crossbreeding programs involving Creole breeds  and the added value resulting from their products  could make a major contribution towards their survival for the future. The contributions to within- and between-breed genetic diversity based on 'neutral’ genetic markers were evaluated in a large sample of Iberoamerican cattle breeds  to provide the basis for establishing conservation priorities. Our results indicate that Creole cattle breeds retain considerable levels of genetic diversity and that several local isolated breeds are important reservoirs of genetic diversity. Conservation priorities depended on the approach used  i.e.  on whether the emphasis was placed on the within- or the between-breed component of genetic diversity. In general  if the focus was on between-breed diversity  the Creole breeds classified as top priority were the most clearly differentiated with smaller census and higher levels of inbreeding  while if the focus was on within-breed genetic diversity  they failed to be considered. Thus  besides its contribution to the overall genetic diversity  other features of a breed should also be considered when considering a conservation program  such as its adaptation to specific environments  possession of unique traits  cultural and historical value  and contribution to environmental sustainability  among others. Other types of genetic markers  including novel SNPs  may detect other genetic factors related to breed differentiation  especially those underlying adaptation and production traits  and should be investigated for use in conservation applications.

ANN with Bayesian regularization performed as well as linear Bayesian regression models in predicting additive genetic values  supporting the idea that ANN are useful as universal approximators of functions of interest in breeding contexts. The availability of genome-wide dense marker panels for many species of plants and animals has opened doors for incorporating genomic information into practical breeding programs  an approach known as genomic selection []. It is now easy to generate genome-wide scans with more than one million SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) but these huge databases pose challenges in computational capacity  data analysis and interpretation of results for genomic selection []. For example  even with an initial screening to reduce the number of markers to less than ten thousand SNPs  it is still not feasible for most computational platforms to evaluate all combinations of SNP associations  even when low-dimension interactions are explored []. Hence  reduction of dimensionality and feature extraction arguably play pivotal roles in current genomic studies []. The intensive computation inherent in these problems has altered the course of methodological developments  and the same is true for genomic selection []. In the genome-enabled prediction of genetic merit for breeding purposes  parametric statistical methods tend to make strong assumptions about functional forms and the statistical distribution of marker effects. On the one hand  ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction assumes that all markers have an effect on the trait of interest  and that these effects share a common variance in their distribution. This simple assumption is obviously not true in reality. On the other hand  hierarchical linear Bayesian regression models  such as BayesA and BayesB []  allow marker effects to be estimated with differential shrinkage. However  posterior inference  in particular for the variances of marker effects  depends heavily on the prior assumptions used in these models []. Hence  BayesCp [] was proposed to overcome some of the above mentioned drawbacks. A BayesCp model postulates an unknown probability p that a SNP has no effect at all on the trait  while all non-zero SNP effects are assumed to be random samples from a normal distribution with null mean and a common variance. Recently  there has been interest in the use of non-parametric methods for the prediction of quantitative traits  such as reproducing kernel Hilbert space regressions [  ]  radial basis function models [] and non-parametric Bayesian models with Dirichlet process priors []. These nonparametric methods make weaker assumptions and can be more flexible for describing complex relationships []. Artificial neural networks (ANN)  also known as neuro-computational models  provide an appealing alternative for genome-enabled prediction of quantitative traits [  ]. These machine learning methods can act as universal approximators of complex functions [] because they are capable of capturing nonlinear relationships between predictors and responses and can adaptively learn complex functional forms  through a series of transformations (i.e.  activation functions) driven by parameters. Multilayer feed-forward is the most common architecture used in ANN  which consists of neurons assembled into layers. The first layer is called the input layer (the left-most layer of the ANN) that accepts data (e.g.  SNP genotypes) from sources external to the network  and the last layer (the right-most layer) is called the output layer that contains output units of the network. In between these two layers are so-called hidden layers  because their values are not observed in the training set. Hence  an ANN architecture is specified by the number of layers  the number of neurons in each layer  and the type of activation functions that are used. Neurons in each layer are connected to the neurons from the previous and the subsequent layer through adaptable synaptic weights. The network weights are evaluated in two steps: the feed-forward and the back-propagation steps. In the feed-forward step  information comes from the input layer and each unit evaluates its activation function  which is transmitted to the units connected to the output layer. The back-propagation step consists of running the whole network backwards to minimize the error function in the space of weights using the method of gradient descent. A set of weights that minimizes the error function is considered to be a solution of the learning problem for the ANN. Determination of the number of neurons to be placed in the hidden layer is a critical task in the design of ANN. A network with an insufficient number of neurons may not be capable of capturing complex patterns. In contrast  a network with too many neurons will suffer from over-parameterization  leading to over-fitting and poor predictive ability of yet to be observed data. Two popular techniques to overcome the over-fitting problem in ANN models are Bayesian regularization and cross-validated early stopping (CVES). Bayesian regularization (BR) constrains (shrinks) the magnitude of the networks weights  improves generalization and allows bias in parameter estimates towards values that are considered to be plausible  while reducing their variance; thus  there is a bias-variance trade-off []. Unlike other back-propagation training algorithm methods that use a single set of parameters  BR considers all possible values of network parameters weighted by the probability of each set of parameters. In practice  Bayesian regularized ANN can be computationally more robust and cost-effective than standard back-propagation nets because they can reduce or eliminate the need for lengthy cross-validation. With cross-validated early stopping (CVES) methods  the training data set is split into a new training and a validation set and a gradient descent algorithm is applied to the new training data set. The ANN performs an iterative process  first using the training data set to calculate the weight and bias estimates  and then applies these parameter estimates in the validation data set to calculate the prediction errors. The process iterates repeatedly  substituting parameter estimates from the training data set into the validation data set to find the smallest possible average prediction errors for the validation data set. Training ceases when the error in the validation data set increases in certain consecutive epochs (iterations) in order to avoid the problem of over-fitting (the number of consecutive epochs is 6 by default in MATLAB). The ANN parameter estimates with the best performance in the validation set is then used on the testing data to evaluate the predictive ability of the network. In a previous study  ANN with BR outperformed a benchmark linear model when predicting milk yield in dairy cattle or grain yield of wheat []. However  because breeding values are defined in terms of linear functions based upon additive inheritance  the predictive performance of ANN relative to linear additive systems is of some interest. This motivated the present study  in which the aim was to investigate the accuracy of ANN for predicting expected progeny differences (EPD) for marbling score in Angus cattle relative to hierarchical linear Bayesian regression models. Various ANN architectures were explored  which involved two training algorithms  two types of activation functions  and from 1 to 4 neurons in hidden layers. The data contained 3079 registered Angus bulls  genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip  from which the SNP content for the Illumina Bovine3K BeadChip [] was extracted. After data quality control and screening  a total of 2421 polymorphic SNPs were retained for analysis. The target variable to be predicted was EPD for marbling score  which had been computed by the American Angus Association using BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) for each of these animals  based upon their pedigree data and progeny carcass and ultrasound data []. In animal breeding  an EPD is defined as the predicted performance of a future offspring of an animal for a particular trait (marbling score)  calculated from measurement(s) of the animal’s own performance and/or the performance of its relatives under the assumption of additive inheritance. Hence  EPD represent a typical linear system since the EPD of an individual can be represented as a linear function of the EPD of relatives and a residual term that reflects the fact that an individual inherits a random sample of the genes present within its parents. The distribution of marbling score EPD in the Angus sample was symmetric and suggested a normal distribution (Figure )  with mean and standard deviation estimated at 0.0265 and 0.254  respectively [].                                                      A schematic presentation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed-forward of an ANN is presented in Figure . This is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network with a single middle (hidden) layer and four neurons. Training an ANN involves the minimization of an error function that depends on the network’s synaptic weights (the w’s in Figure )  and these weights are iteratively updated by a learning algorithm  to approximate the target variable. The updating is usually accomplished by back-propagating the error  which is essentially a non-linear least-squares problem []. Back-propagation is a supervised learning algorithm based on a suitable error function  the values of which are determined by the target (i.e.  marbling EPD) and the mapped (predicted) outputs of the network (i.e.  fitted values of marbling EPD). Weights in an MLP architecture are determined by a back-propagation algorithm to minimize the sum of squares of errors using gradient-descent methods []. During the training  weights and biases in the ANN are successively adjusted based on the input and the desired output. Each iteration of feed-forward in a MLP constitutes two sweeps: forward activation to produce a desired output  and backward propagation of the computed error to update the values for the weights and biases. The forward and backward sweeps are repeatedly performed until the ANN solution agrees with the desired value to within a pre-specified tolerance [  ].  Genotypes for 2421 (or 700) SNPs were used as inputs <U+2009>=<U+2009>{|<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 <U+2009>2 <U+2009>… <U+2009>}  where  is the number of individuals with genotypes; each SNP was connected to up to 4 neurons via coefficients   where  denotes neuron and  denotes SNP; here   is a weight from a hidden layer units to the output unit   is an activation function applied to hidden layer units (e.g.  the hyperbolic tangent)   is an activation function applied to the output layer unit (e.g.  linear)   and  are biases of hidden and output layer units  and  is a predicted value. Let  be a row vector that contains SNP genotypes for all  = 1 … n individuals  for the  SNP  where  = 1 …..   and  = 700 (referred to as the 700-SNP panel) or  = 2421 (referred to as the 3K-SNP panel). In an ANN  SNP genotypes are connected to each neuron in a single hidden layer via weights  for <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 <U+2009>… <U+2009> neurons  with each weight defining a specific SNP-neuron connection with appropriate biases (intercepts)    each pertaining to a specific neuron. The input into neuron   prior to activation is expressed linearly as   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>700 or 2421  and  is the bias parameter defined in the hidden layer and this quantity is then transformed using some linear or nonlinear activation function () as: The above is the output of the hidden layer  which in turn is delivered to the output layer (e.g.  each neuron  in the hidden layer sums ANN input  after multiplying them by the strengths of the respective connection weights    and adds biases  and then computes its output as a function of the sum)  and is collected as: where  is the weight specific to the  neuron (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 <U+2009>2 <U+2009>… <U+2009>) and  is the bias parameter defined in the output layer. Next  quantity (2) is activated with the following function: The above yields the fitted marbling EPD    for each individual in the training set. Finally  the predicted value of marbling score EPD can be computed in the testing set using a formula similar to (3). We used the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear (identity) activation functions in the hidden and output layers  respectively. We used BR and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) back-propagation as training algorithms. The basic idea of back-propagation algorithms is to adjust weights in the steepest descent direction (negative of the gradient)  such that the objective function decreases most rapidly []. However  in practice  this does not necessarily produce the fastest convergence  although the function may decrease most rapidly along the negative of the gradient. Several conjugate gradient algorithms have been proposed  in which a search is performed along conjugate directions  generally leading to faster convergence to a local function minimum than steepest descent directions [  ]. On the one hand  with the exception of SCG  the conjugate gradient algorithms use linear searches at each iteration and thus  are computationally expensive as they require that the network response to all training inputs be computed several times for each search. On the other hand  the SCG algorithm combines a model-trust region approach with the conjugate gradient approach and uses a step size scaling mechanism to avoid time-consuming linear searches []. Hence  SCG can significantly reduce the number of computations performed in each iteration  but may require more iterations to converge than do the other conjugate gradient algorithms []. SCG uses the CVES technique to prevent over-fitting  which is commonly used in neural networks and can improve their predictive ability (generalization). Training proceeds as follows. Let the data set be <U+2009>= { <U+2009>{}}  where  is a vector of inputs (SNP genotypes) for individual  and  is a vector of target variables (EPD). Once a set of weights   is assigned to the connections in the networks  this defines a mapping from the input  to the output . Let  denote a specific network architecture (in terms of numbers of neurons and choice of activation functions)  then the typical objective function used for training a neural network using CVES is the sum of squared prediction errors (): for  input-target pairs defining . Regularization produces shrinkage of parameter estimates towards some plausible values  while at the same time reducing their variance. In Bayesian models  regularization techniques involve imposing certain prior distributions on the model parameters. In Bayesian ANN (e.g.  BRANN)  the objective function that was specified in (4) has an additional term that penalizes large weights  in the hope of achieving a smoother mapping. Gradient-based optimization is then used to minimize the following function  equal to a penalized log-likelihood  where  ( ) is the sum of squares of network weights   is the ANN architecture  and a and  are positive regularization parameters that must be estimated. The second term on the right hand side of (5)  known as weight decay  favors small values of  and decreases the tendency of a model to over-fit the data. Hence  training involves a tradeoff between model complexity and goodness of fit. Large values of  lead to posterior densities of weights that are highly concentrated around zero  so that the weights effectively disappear  the model discounts connections in the network [  ]  and complex models are automatically self-penalized. From equation ()  if a << ß  the fitting or training algorithm places the most weight on goodness of fit. If a >> ß  emphasis is placed on reducing the magnitude of the weights at the expense of goodness of fit  while producing a smoother network response []. In an empirical Bayesian framework  the “optimal” weights are those that maximize the conditional posterior density (| <U+2009> <U+2009> <U+2009>)  which is equivalent to minimizing the regularized objective function  in equation (). Minimization of  is identical to finding the (locally) maximum  estimates of  denoted   which minimize  using the back-propagation training algorithms []. However  this is possible only if  >   where  is the number of parameters to be estimated. Bayes theorem yields the posterior density of  and  as: If the prior density ( <U+2009>|) is uniform  maximization of ( <U+2009>| <U+2009>) with respect to  and  is equivalent to maximization of (| <U+2009> <U+2009>). Bayesian optimization of the regularization parameters requires computation of the Hessian matrix of the objective function  evaluated at the optimum point []  but directly computing the Hessian matrix is not always necessary. As proposed by MacKay []  the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian matrix can be used if the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm is employed to locate the minimum of [    ]. The Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm [] achieves second-order training speed without computing the Hessian matrix. Briefly  the Hessian matrix is approximated as: where  is the Jacobian matrix that contains first derivatives of the network errors with respect to network parameters (the weights and biases). The gradient is computed as: and network parameters are updated as: Here   is Levenberg's damping factor  which is adjusted at each iteration and guides the optimization process. If the reduction of error sum of squares is rapid  a smaller value of  is used to bring the algorithm closer to the Gauss–Newton algorithm. Alternatively  the damping factor is increased to give a step to gradient descent direction if an iteration provides insufficient reduction in the error sum of squares []. Optimal values of regularization parameters   and   in BRANN can be calculated as: and where 0 = <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>2()<U+2009>=<U+2009> the number of effective parameters in the neural network  and  is the total number of parameters. Here  is the maximum  estimate of H described in (7). Consider the following linear model: where  is the marbling score EPD for the  animal;  is the overall mean;  is the substitution effect associated with the  SNP (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 <U+2009>… <U+2009>);  is an indicator variable corresponding to the genotype at the  SNP (0  1  2) for the  individual  and  is a residual term  where  is the residual variance. The BayesCp model [] assumes that each SNP effect is null with probability   or that it follows a normal distribution    with probability 1-   i.e.: Here   is a variance common to all non-zero SNP effects  which is assigned a scaled inverse chi-square distribution  . Furthermore  the value of  is unknown and needs to be inferred  with the prior distribution of  taken to be uniform between 0 and 1  A Bernoulli indicator variable    is introduced to facilitate sampling from the mixtures of the SNP effects  as follows: Hence  unconditionally  the variable  follows a univariate-t distribution    if <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  or is equal to zero otherwise []. Posterior inference of unknown parameters in the Bayesian model via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation is described in []. With a subset of  say <U+2009>=<U+2009>  selected markers  the statistical model takes the same form as (12)  replacing  with  for the number of markers. By assuming that all  of the selected SNPs (based on the posterior model probability and including the frequency of marker  during MCMC) have non-null effects on the quantitative trait  we define a BayesCp model with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  which was used for the statistical inference and model cross-validation subsequent to selection of markers (referred to as post-selection hereafter). So  posterior inference in BayesCp with  = 0 was as for BayesC   except that  was fixed at zero and hence sampling of the indicator vector  was no longer relevant. MATLAB [] was used to fit the ANN. Each neural network consisted of three layers (i.e.  input  hidden and output layers). The number of neurons in a single hidden layer varied from 1 to 4. Each ANN had 2421 (or 700) inputs (SNPs). Before processing  MATLAB automatically rescaled all input and output variables using the “mapminmax” function such that they resided in the range [-1  +1]  to enhance numerical stability. Two combinations of activation functions were used: (i) a set of hyperbolic tangent sigmoidal activation functions from the input layer to the hidden layer  plus a linear activation function from the hidden layer to the output layer  and (ii) a set of linear activation functions from the input layer to the hidden layer and from the hidden layer to the output layer. Training was stopped if any of the following criteria were met: (i) a maximum number (1000) of epochs was reached  (ii) performance had met a pre-specified (the performance function for feed-forward networks is the mean square error) level  (iii) the gradient was below a suitable target  or (iv) the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter exceeded 10. For each ANN architecture  eight replicates were run. Each replicate was independently initialized  in order to eliminate spurious effects caused by the starting values  and to improve predictive ability. The results were presented as averages across the eight replicates per ANN architecture. BayesCp with p set equal to zero (referred to as the BayesCpC procedure) was implemented via a high-throughput computing pipeline to select SNPs for post-selection statistical inference and cross-validation []. This pipeline ran multiple chains for both feature selection and cross-validation. A three-fold cross-validation approach was employed  in which the whole dataset was divided into three approximately equal portions  with two-thirds used for training and one-third used for testing  and the portions used for training and testing were rotated three times. Each cross-validation experiment was randomly replicated eight times. Three parallel MCMC chains were run for each feature-selection analysis  and each consisted of 50 000 iterations after a burn-in of 5000 iterations  thinned every tenth iterate. MCMC sampling for each cross-validation consisted of 100 000 iterations  with a burn-in of 10 000 iterations  thinned every tenth iterate. The predictive performance of each ANN was examined using either the 3K-SNP panel or an optimal subset of 700 selected SNPs. The latter were derived from the 3K-panel  selected using the BayesCpC procedure with three-fold cross-validation. This was accomplished by examining the prediction performance of varying panel sizes from 100 to 2400 SNPs in 100-SNP increments  and the optimal set that gave the best prediction in cross-validations was identified. The reason for not choosing the optimal subset based on ANN models was because the selection tasks with a grid of 24 candidate SNP-panels of varying sizes were too computationally intensive for BRANN. Nevertheless  the parallel-BayesCpC pipeline handled this task easily  because all jobs were submitted to run in parallel on a cluster of dedicated computers. As shown in Figure a  the correlation between marbling score EPD and their fitted values in the training set (referred to hereafter as fitting accuracy) increased almost monotonically with panel size  until reaching a plateau at a panel size of 1400 SNPs. However  the correlation between marbling score EPD and their predicted values in the testing set (referred to hereafter as predictive accuracy) reached its peak (0.863) with a panel size of 700 SNPs  and decreased thereafter. The decrease in prediction accuracy with > 700 selected SNPs possibly reflects over-fitting in the training set  which  in this case  happened much before the panel size exceeded the training set size (i.e.  approximately 2000 animals). Hence  with Bayesian regression models  prediction using more SNPs may not necessarily yield better results than prediction using a smaller panel  yet the optimal panel size may depend on many factors. In this study  we empirically chose the 700-SNP subset as the optimal panel. The fitting accuracy in the training set and predictive accuracy in the testing set using the optimal 700-SNP subset are illustrated in Figure b.  Correlations between marbling score EPD and their fitted (predicted) values in the training and testing sets  where the SNP panel consisted of 100  200 …  2400 markers  respectively;  correlation between EPD (input values) and fitted values in the training set (upper) and correlation between EPD (input values) and predicted values in the testing set for the optimal set of 700 SNPs (lower). The performance of the ANN architectures was examined based on the sum of squared errors (SSE) of prediction with a 3K panel  averaged over eight independent replicates of each ANN  for both BRANN and SCGANN. Each ANN had a distinct combination of training algorithm  transformation method  and number of neurons  but both  BRANN and SCGANN  had an input of 3K SNPs. The average SSE ranged from 13.936 to 16.882 for BRANN  and from 36.531 to 39.571 for SCGANN. Smaller SSE were produced by BRANN with nonlinear activation functions and from 2 to 4 neurons  and by SCGANN with nonlinear activation functions and from 1 to 4 neurons. There was no evidence that more complex networks (e.g.  with more neurons or a non-linear transformation function) produced better predictions than the linear model  as the ANN were similar in terms of their SSE. Possibly  this was because marbling score EPD is estimated under an additive model of inheritance in which additive genetic merit has a linear relationship with SNP effects. Nevertheless  BRANN performed as well as the linear models when predicting this linear system. Also  BRANN consistently produced a more accurate prediction of marbling score EPD than did SCGANN. On average  SSE obtained from BRANN were about 40% to 50% of those obtained from SCGANN (Figure ). This is attributed to the use of Bayesian regularization  which handles over-fitting better than does the SCG back-propagation.                                                      BRANN and BayesCpC performed very similarly with the 3K-SNP panel and both methods yielded higher prediction accuracies than did SCGANN (Figure ). On average  the correlation in the training set was 0.941 with BayesCpC. This correlation ranged from 0.942 to 0.967 with BRANN  and from 0.796 to 0.897 with SCGANN. The average correlation (in the testing set) was 0.776 with BayesCpC  and ranged from 0.776 to 0.807 with BRANN  and from 0.653 to 0.689 with SCGANN. In general  these correlations increased slightly with the number of neurons  but no consistent pattern was observed (Figure ).  training = correlations in the training sets; testing = correlations in the testing sets; BayesCpC = Bayesian regression model  where the BayesCp model is used for feature selection and BayesCp with p = 0 is used for post-selection statistical inference and cross-validation; BRANN = artificial neural network with Bayesian regularization; SCGANN = artificial neural network with scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation. With the 3K-SNP panel  the number of SNPs (i.e.  2421) exceeded the number of animals (~2000 animals) in the training set. This means that there were more parameters to be estimated than data points  even when all SNPs entered the model linearly. This explains the better predictive performance of BRANN over SCGANN: Bayesian regularization imposes a penalty for model complexity and prevents over-fitting  while SCGANN captures both signal and noise in the training set  leading to poor prediction. The results illustrate that ANN with Bayesian regularization can behave better than ANN with SCG back-propagation. BRANN penalize the estimation of large weights to achieve a smoother mapping  which leads to effectively more parsimonious models. In the BayesCpC procedure  the BayesCp model postulates that a portion  p  of all SNPs have no effect on marbling EPD. In a high-density SNP panel  p is typically expected to be large  meaning that the portion of “signal” SNPs  1 - p  is small  and the chance of over-fitting is reduced. Using the Illumina Bovine3K SNP genotypes  the posterior mean (standard deviation) of p was 0.621 (0.0830)  based on 2421 polymorphic SNPs; this means that  on average  918 SNPs were fitted in the model at each MCMC iteration. Hence  over-fitting was not a concern. Posterior densities for p are shown in Figure  and were computed using posterior samples obtained from each of the three parallel chains and from all pooled samples of the three chains. The density plots for the three parallel chains highly resembled each other and had similar means  indicating that convergence and length of the MCMC chains were appropriate for p. We noticed that the estimate of p obtained from the 3K panel was smaller than that based on BovineSNP50 genotypes  because the latter has typically been greater than 0.95 []. Thus  it would seem that  with a low-density SNP panel  the interpretation of SNPs having putatively non-zero effects on the target traits should be taken with caution  because many could be distant from the functional genes or quantitative trait loci. We also observed that the selected number of SNPs having non-zero effects based on BayesCp in the training set did not correspond to the number of SNPs in the optimal SNP panel for prediction (918 vs 700 SNPs). We suspect that parameter p in a BayesCp model does not fully inform on the size of an optimal SNP panel for prediction; a model that describes variation in a training set well does not necessarily yield the best predictions when generalized beyond the training set. This phenomenon is referred to as poor generalization in machine learning methods [].                                                          Unlike the case with 3K-SNPs  prediction using the selected 700-SNPs was not challenged by over-fitting. Hence  we observed a smaller difference in prediction performance between BRANN and SCGANN because regularization was not a decisive issue in the prediction. With the 700-SNP panel  the predictive performance of BayesCpC was slightly better than that of BRANN  possibly because the subset of SNPs was optimal  at least as selected by BayesCpC. As expected  BayesCp and BRANN outperformed SCGANN in the prediction of marbling score EPD but differences in performance were smaller with the 700-SNP panel than with the 3K-SNP panel. Average prediction accuracy was 0.863 with BayesCpC and ranged from 0.843 to 0.858 with BRANN  whereas the average prediction accuracy with SCGANN ranged from 0.743 to 0.793. For both BRANN and SCGANN  the difference in predictive accuracy between the linear and non-linear activation functions was negligible (Figure ).  training = correlations in the training sets; testing = correlations in the testing sets; BayesCpC = Bayesian regression model  where BayesCp is used for feature selection and BayesCp with p = 0 is used for post-selection statistical inference and cross-validation; BRANN = artificial neural network with Bayesian regularization; SCGANN = artificial neural network with scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation. We investigated the predictive performance of ANN in comparison to a hierarchical Bayesian regression model  using 3K-SNP and 700-SNP panels. The 700 SNPs were preselected from the former based upon their power to predict marbling EPD. Various ANN architectures to predict marbling score EPD were examined  in conjunction with two training algorithms  two types of activation functions  and from 1 to 4 neurons in the hidden layer. We did not observe significant differences in predictive accuracy between linear and non-linear models  probably because the relationship between marbling score EPD and SNP effects is theoretically linear. An EPD produces a smoothed data point based on additive inheritance  and this smoothing may mask non-linear variation in the response variable. A better way to analyze this trait would be to remove variation due to contemporary groups from the field data and then analyze individual marbling phenotypes  but this was not possible here because we did not have access to the raw data  which were  in general  collected on progeny of the genotyped bulls. The accuracy of EPD varies between individuals  which suggests that the residuals may be heteroscedastic due to unequal prediction error variances. An alternative is to use deregressed EPD as the target variable  for which the parent averages are removed and appropriate weights can be applied to account for heteroscedastic residuals []. Some reports suggest that training on deregressed EBV could generate higher accuracy of genome-enhanced breeding values than training on EBV []. However  the main purpose of the present research was to investigate the predictive performance of ANN in comparison with Bayesian regression models in a linear system. We used EPD instead of deregressed proofs because correct deregression involves matrix operations (the data available were incomplete for correct deregression)  or approximations. Both EPD and deregressed EPD are heteroscedastic because of an unequal amount of information  but the neural network software used did not allow for incorporation of heteroscedasticity in a straightforward manner. In genomic selection  the joint estimation of a genome-wide SNP set is challenging due to the so-called “large   small ” problem  meaning that there are many more parameters to estimate than there are data points. This leads to over-fitting of the model in the training set and poor predictive performance when generalized to the testing set. With the 3K-panel  the number of animals (n ˜ 2000) in the training data set was less than the number of SNP markers ( = 2421). Hence  over-fitting might occur with linear regression models. The same is true for ANN models. In the ANN with 4 neurons  for example  there were approximately 9700 weights and bias parameters to estimate  which is much more than the number of data points in the training set. Hence  variance shrinkage (as occurs in the hierarchical Bayesian regression models) or Bayesian regularization (as occurs in BRANN) plays a crucial role in attenuating “over-fitting” and attaining reproducible predictive performance. In ANN  the effective number of parameters used in the model is typically less than the total number of weights  because some weights do not contribute due to shrinkage. Thus  over-fitting is attenuated and a model that generalizes well can potentially be attained []. In BRANN with the 3K-panel  for example  the effective number of parameters was 1282  1213  1031  999 and 998  respectively  for linear and 1-  2-  3- and 4-neuron nonlinear architectures. These numbers are much smaller than the actual number of parameters in the models or the number of data points (ranging from 1946 to 2060 EPD) in the training set. On the one hand  parametric statistical approaches have limited flexibility for modeling high-order non-linear interactions that may be important for complex traits [  ]. On the other hand  neural networks have the potential to capture nonlinear relationships and may be useful in the study of quantitative traits under complex gene action  given suitable inputs. In a previous study  it was shown that non-linear neural networks outperformed a benchmark linear model when predicting phenotypes  especially in inbred wheat lines where cryptic gene interactions are expected []. In the present study  the predictive ability of BRANN was similar to that of BayesCpC with the 3K-panel and the selected 700-SNP panel. In addition  there was no difference in predictive ability between linear-ANN and non-linear ANN. We expected this because marbling score EPD are estimated under an additive linear model and so they should be predicted adequately under an ANN with a linear activation function. Nevertheless  we found that non-linear ANN with Bayesian regularization behaved as well as the linear models when predicting an additive target. Our results support the idea that ANN with Bayesian regularization can act as universal approximators of linear or non-linear functions of interest in breeding contexts. Although BRANN consistently yielded better predictions than SCGANN  computing time with BRANN may restrict the application of these models. BRANN training updates the weights and biases using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization  and its computing time can increase drastically with the number of SNPs included in the model. For example  while it took only about 4 minutes to perform 1000 iterations for a BRANN with 1 neuron for the 700-SNP panel  112 minutes were required for the 3K-SNP panel. The 3K-SNP analysis also consumed tens of times more memory. Thus  the application of BRANN to high-density chips (say 50K SNP or higher) is a significant challenge and improvements in the algorithms are needed before BRANN can be practically applied to genomic selection. One solution is to use (distributed) parallel computing  as we did with the high-throughput computing pipeline that implements hierarchical Bayesian regression models []. The SCG training algorithm was proposed to avoid the time-consuming search employed in BRANN  with significantly reduced computing time per iteration. However  the SCG back-propagation approach yielded worse predictions than both BRANN and the Bayesian regression models. Finally  we found that feature selection may be important for Bayesian regression models because a model using all SNPs did not necessarily give the best prediction of marbling EPD. This situation is unlike ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction  or the G-BLUP method [  ]  where a model that includes all markers would typically be favored due to the increase in accuracy that comes with including additional markers. ANN with Bayesian regularization can perform as well as linear Bayesian regression models in predicting additive genetic values. ANN may be useful for predicting complex traits using high-dimensional genomic information and capture nonlinearities  and do so adaptively. While the selection of models of varying dimensions may be an issue worth exploring  it brings tremendous computing challenges  particularly when the data set is large. Hence  high-performance computing will be required for genomic selection using Bayesian regression models or artificial neural networks.

In all breeds  imputation accuracy was higher than 97%  which indicates that imputation to the high-density chip was accurate. Imputation accuracy depends mainly on the size of the reference population and the relationship between reference and target populations. The development of a high throughput chip of 54 001 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cattle  the Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (50K)  has drastically reduced genotyping costs and strongly contributed to the current implementation of genomic selection (GS). This approach  which was first proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  uses a reference population (usually consisting of progeny-tested bulls) with both genotypes and phenotypes to estimate marker effects and then uses these estimates to predict breeding values for animals without phenotypes. The accuracy of prediction depends mainly on the size of the reference population  heritability of the phenotypes  and level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) [  ]. In some bovine breeds  a very large number of animals have been genotyped with the 50K chip and it is now possible to predict breeding values of animals at birth with high accuracy. In breeds with a limited number of progeny-tested bulls  assembling a large enough reference population is a real challenge. Under the assumption that LD is conserved across breeds  reference populations from different breeds can be combined to increase the size of the reference population. Conservation of LD  however  requires more than 300 000 informative SNPs and therefore  is not fulfilled with the classically used 50K chip []. The BovineHD BeadChip (HD) that was developed in 2010 and contains 777K SNPs is expected to be sufficiently dense to detect conserved LD across breeds and allow multi-breed GS. Re-genotyping all animals on this HD chip is  however  not economically feasible but prediction (imputation) of HD genotypes from 50K genotypes is possible. Several imputation methods have been implemented and are widely used to impute genotypes from one chip to another. They are based either on population LD (Fastphase []  Beagle []  MaCH []  IMPUTE2 [])  or on a combination of LD and family information (Fimpute []  Dagphase []  AlphaImpute []  FindHap []). Many studies have compared these methods for imputation from low-density panels to the 50K chip. Beagle 3.3.0 has been shown to be an accurate software package [–] and is commonly used in bovine datasets. In this study  Beagle 3.3.0 was used to study the accuracy of imputation from the Illumina 50K to the HD chip in 16 French cattle breeds and to investigate the main factors that affect this accuracy. The dataset comprised 5153 animals genotyped with the HD chip. The cryopreserved semen  or blood samples of the animals included in our study  which were used for genotyping  were procured from various commercial AI organizations and breeder organizations through their routine practice in the framework of breeding programs. Therefore  no ethical approval was required for sampling of biological material. The HD chip contains 777 964 markers with an average probe spacing of 3.45 kilobases (kb) []. Animals belonged to 16 breeds (seven dairy breeds and nine beef breeds). The number of genotypes was not equally distributed across breeds (Table ) but depended on population size. Animals genotyped with the HD chip were chosen based on their marginal contribution to the population  as defined by Boichard et al. []  and computed using the PEDIG software []. If possible  two to three progeny of each founder were also genotyped in order to increase phasing accuracy  and the most influential progeny were chosen for HD-genotyping. In some situations  and in particular in breeds with small populations  the number of HD-genotyped animals was constrained by the availability of DNA from ancestors. The family structure of each breed is detailed in Table . The mean number of HD-genotyped male progeny per bull was higher in dairy breeds (2.5) than in beef breeds (2). In the Holstein breed  a large proportion of genotypes originated from the Eurogenomics consortium [  ]. Another dataset  containing 33 746 animals genotyped with the Bovine SNP50 BeadChip []  was also available. The genotypes originated either from the national genomic selection program or from complementary research programs  except for most of the Holstein genotypes  which were from the Eurogenomics consortium. HD and 50k genotypes were used for parentage testing and to check the clustering quality of the HD genotypes by concordance analysis of the genotypes of the 1838 individuals genotyped on both chips. Quality control was performed within-breed on the HD and 50K genotypes  using the same criteria for both chips. Genotyped animals with a call rate lower than 0.95 were removed from the analysis. Only markers mapped on the UMD3.1 assembly covering the 29 bovine autosomes were used for analysis. SNPs showing departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p-value < 0.001) or with more than 10% missing genotypes were removed. In addition  genotype consistency was checked using 1838 animals that were genotyped on both chips and 352 markers that were discordant for more than 1% of these animals were excluded. After editing  708 771 and 44 580 SNPs were retained on the HD and 50K sets  respectively. The 37 634 SNPs present on both HD and 50K sets were used to mimic 50K genotypes. Parentage was tested following the French routine genomic selection procedure  using both 50K and HD datasets (S. Fritz  personal communication). This procedure uses 500 informative markers and a parentage error was concluded if more than 10 incompatibilities were detected. In case of inconsistency  the progeny was removed  except when at least two progeny from the same sire were found incompatible with their sire. In this case  the sire was removed. Genotypes were checked for Mendelian inconsistencies between compatible parents and offspring. The genotype of the male parent was deleted if more than 20% of its progeny showed contradiction  in other cases the genotype of the progeny was set to missing. The accuracy of imputation from 50k to HD genotypes was computed within each breed. For this purpose  the HD-dataset was divided into two parts. The oldest animals were used as a training population to mimic a reference population genotyped with the HD chip. The 20% youngest animals formed the validation population. For animals in the validation population  markers that were only present on the HD chip were masked to mimic a target population genotyped with the 50K. Beagle 3.3.0 was used to impute mimicked 50K genotypes up to high-density. This software uses a population-based method called “localized haplotype-cluster method”  as described by Browning and Browning []. The method builds and clusters haplotypes along the whole chromosome and then uses an underlying variable length Markov chain based on haplotypes counts (and consequently on local LD patterns) to determine transition probabilities from one marker to the next. The scale and shift parameters were set to 2 and 0.1  respectively  and no pedigree information was taken into account. Imputation accuracy was estimated based on the comparison between imputed and known HD genotypes and was defined as the allelic imputation error rate  computed as the ratio between the number of falsely imputed alleles and the total number of imputed alleles []. Identification of SNPs with high error rates is important because they may induce errors in QTL detection and genomic selection. To identify these SNPs  only the breeds with the largest populations (Blonde d’Aquitaine  Charolais  Holstein  Limousine  Montbéliarde and Normande) were considered in order to avoid erroneous identification of errors due to the use of a low number of genotypes when computing the error rate for a SNP. Given the large number of breeds included here  it was possible to analyze the factors that may have an effect on imputation accuracy. Two types of variables that differ between breeds were studied: genetic diversity indicators such as the level of linkage disequilibrium and the number of effective ancestors  and variables specific to our datasets  such as the number of genotypes in the reference population and the relationship between reference and validation populations. To avoid bias due to sampling  we used the indicators computed by Danchin-Burge [] using the complete pedigree file of each breed. The number of effective ancestors was preferred to effective population size since the former is less sensitive to the depth of the pedigree []. Linkage disequilibrium was computed within-breed as a squared correlation coefficient based on phased genotypes for each marker pair []  as defined in equation (): where A1  A2  B1  B2 are the alleles of SNP A and B  p p  p  and p are the corresponding allelic frequencies  and p is the frequency of the A1B1 haplotype. For the Abondance breed  LD was computed for SNPs on  (BTA) chromosomes 5  10  15  20 and 25 and no differences between chromosomes were observed (data not shown). Therefore  for other breeds  LD computation was only performed on BTA5. Pairs of SNPs for which one SNP has a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5% in the considered breed were discarded because it has been shown that LD tends to be very low in such cases []. Furthermore  removing SNPs with low MAF facilitates comparisons between populations [  ]. Then  LD for all marker pairs were averaged by the distance between SNPs. We focused particularly on the level of LD between SNPs 70 kb apart  which corresponds to the average distance between two informative SNPs on the 50K chip. Average relationship levels between training and validation populations were measured based on pedigree information using the PEDIG [] software. A relationship coefficient was computed for each pair of individuals in each population and then averaged for each breed. The effect of the different factors on imputation accuracy was assessed by multiple regression across all evaluated datasets (including both dairy and beef breeds). Tested factors were the reference population size  the number of effective ancestors  the linkage disequilibrium level at 70 kb and the relationship between training and validation populations. Factors were considered significant if the regression coefficient was different from zero (p-value < 0.05). Since our aim was to improve imputation accuracy in breeds with a small reference population size  multi-breed imputation was tested. Training and validation populations from different breeds were combined and then imputation accuracy was computed as described above. Considering the diversity of the breeds involved in this project  it did not seem relevant to combine all breeds. Instead  breeds were grouped based on Reynolds genetic distances between breeds  which were computed by Gautier et al. [] using allele frequencies on the 50K chip and represented in a Neighbor-Joining tree. One branch  which was composed of the Abondance  Montbéliarde and Tarentaise breeds  was taken as an example of closely related breeds and these breeds were merged for the multi-breed study. Imputation accuracy was then computed per animal and averaged for each breed. The results of LD decay are presented in Figure . Within the first 10 kb  LD strongly decreased in all breeds  thereafter it decreased at a lower rate and differences between breeds became noticeable. LD levels at 70 kb (Table ) varied from 0.16 in the Parthenaise breed to 0.26 in the Holstein breed; on average LD levels at 70 kb were higher by 0.04 in dairy breeds than in beef breeds  in agreement with the difference in number of effective ancestors between these breeds.                                                      Error rates were low in most breeds  with an overall mean error rate of 1.36% (Table ). However  large differences were observed between breeds  with a minimum error rate of 0.31% in the Normande breed and a maximum of 2.41% in the Simmental breed. The error rates were less than 0.7% for breeds with more than 500 animals in the reference population. Error rates were lower in dairy breeds (mean error rate = 1.02%) than in beef breeds (mean error rate = 1.62%). In beef breeds  the error rate ranged from 0.64% in the Charolais breed to 2.26% in the Rouge des Prés breed. In dairy breeds  error rates were higher in the Simmental and Brown Swiss breeds  which are regional breeds in France with many imported ancestors and limited numbers of genotyped animals. Sizes of training and validation populations are presented in Table . Error rates decreased linearly when the number of animals in the reference population increased (Figure ). Again  we observed a higher accuracy in dairy breeds: an error rate lower than 1% was achieved with only 100 to 200 genotyped animals in dairy breeds  whereas approximately 400 animals were required for beef breeds. With more than 400 genotyped animals  the impact of reference population size on accuracy leveled off  which suggests that the effect of size of the reference population is non-linear when a critical size is reached.  Breeds with more than 300 animals in the reference population are represented by a square  those with more than 200 animals by a circle  and those with 200 or less animals by a diamond. The relationship between the number of effective ancestors and imputation error rate is illustrated in Figure . The number of effective ancestors appeared to have an opposite effect on dairy versus beef breeds. In dairy breeds  the number of effective ancestors was low (< 50) and its relationship with imputation error rate was positive. However  the two breeds with the highest number of effective ancestors (Simmental and Brown Swiss) among the dairy breeds had the highest imputation error rate but also the smallest reference populations and many foreign ancestors were not genotyped. In beef breeds  a negative relationship between the number of effective ancestors and imputation error rate was observed  but the breeds with the highest number of effective ancestors (Charolais and Limousine) also had the largest reference populations. This suggests that the effect of the number of effective ancestors was masked by the effect of the reference population size. However  when considering populations with equal reference population sizes (e.g. Limousine and Montbeliarde)  the error rates increased with number of effective ancestors.  Breeds with more than 300 animals in the reference population are represented by a square  those with more than 200 animals by a circle  and those with 200 or less animals by a diamond. Figure  presents the relationship of the imputation error rate with the degree of genetic relationship between training and validation populations (R). The first observation is that R was clearly lower in beef than in dairy breeds  which may be explained by a higher number of effective ancestors in beef breeds. The second observation was that when breeds with the largest populations were discarded  the relationship between R and imputation error rate appeared to be linear. Among breeds with large populations  the relationship between training and validation populations had only a limited effect on the imputation error rate. The Charolais and Limousine breeds had low imputation error rates despite their lower R but these breeds have large reference populations. However  the lower R in the Holstein breed probably explains why the error rate was higher in this breed than in the Normande or Montbeliarde breeds.  Breeds with more than 300 animals in the reference population are represented by a square  those with more than 200 animals by a circle  and those with 200 or less animals by a diamond. Finally  multiple linear regression was performed to better quantify the impact of each factor on imputation accuracy. Results of the multiple linear regressions are in Table . Reference population size and R had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on imputation error rate  in contrast to the number of effective ancestors and the level of LD. About half of the variation in imputation error rates was explained by reference population size and one quarter by R. Using the regression coefficients  we can predict that increasing R by 1% reduces imputation error rate by 0.12% and that adding 100 animals to the reference population decreases the error rate by 0.26% (Table ). This suggests that the size of the reference population is the major factor affecting imputation error rate but the relationship between training and validation populations must also be taken into consideration. Despite the difference between breeds  our results suggest that the number of effective ancestors and the level of LD are not major factors affecting imputation accuracy. Imputation error rate was computed for each SNP in order to detect SNPs that were mismapped in the UMD3.1 assembly. This analysis was performed for the six major breeds (three beef breeds and three dairy breeds). Results in the Montbéliarde breed are presented in Figure . Despite an overall mean error rate of 0.51%  13 104 and 6030 SNPs had error rates greater than 5 and 20%  respectively. Consequently  the error rate dropped from 0.51 to 0.40% after removing potentially mismapped SNPs with error rates greater than 5%.                                                      The relationship between MAF and imputation error rate is illustrated in Figure  for the Montbéliarde breed. SNPs were divided in two groups based on their imputation error rates. No relationship with MAF was detected for SNPs with error rates less than 0.1  whereas error rates increased with MAF for SNPs with high error rates. Assuming that the LD between a mismapped SNP and its direct neighbors is low  a mismapped SNP is imputed by chance and therefore its error rate is related to its MAF.                                                      We looked for SNPs with high error rates in each breed based on a threshold that was defined as the mean error rate plus 3 times its standard deviation for that breed. Three thousand and eighty-three  1980  and 1146 SNPs had high error rates in at least two  three or six breeds  respectively. SNPs with high error rates in at least three breeds are likely mismapped and are listed in Additional file : Table S1. Since imputation accuracy depends highly on the number of HD genotypes  we increased the size of the reference population by combining breeds. The results for single- and multi-breed situations are in Table . No difference in accuracy was found between single- and multi-breed imputation for the Abondance and Montbéliarde breeds. For the Tarentaise breed  imputation error rate was slightly higher in the multi-breed analysis than in the single-breed analysis. In this study  we evaluated accuracy of imputation from 50K to HD-genotypes for 16 cattle breeds and we investigated the corresponding causes of variation. We observed large differences in imputation accuracy between breeds. Several factors may explain these differences  i.e. size of the reference population and the relationship between training and validation populations (closely related to population structure). Results from the multiple linear regression performed in this study  combined with other published results  lead us to propose several hypotheses on the impact of each factor. The number of HD genotypes in the reference population ranged from 72 in the Bazadaise breed to 634 in the Holstein breed and is the major factor that explains differences in imputation accuracy between breeds. The imputation error rate decreased by 0.26% when 100 animals were added to the reference population. However  other studies have shown a non-linear effect of reference population size on imputation error rate. In Holstein cattle  Schrooten et al. (unpublished data) reported that imputation error rate decreased by between 0.17 and 0.04% when moving from 200 to 500 HD genotypes by steps of 100  while in sheep  the decrease was 5% when moving from 50 to 150 individuals in the reference population but only 2% when moving from 204 to 2512 individuals []. In our study  the effect of the size of the reference population on imputation error rate was linear. This effect would probably have been found non-linear if more breeds with a large reference population had been included. In fact  the size of the reference population had a limited effect when the number of HD genotypes was greater than a minimum threshold that was estimated at 200–400 animals. Hayes et al. [] reported that most of the differences in imputation accuracy are due to differences in the relationship between the reference and target populations and the genetic diversity of the breed. Schrooten et al. (unpublished data) used traceability  defined as “the expected contribution of HD-genotyped ancestors to the genotype of an animal”  as a measure of the relationship between the reference population and one animal from the target population. Imputation error rates were lower for animals with higher traceability  meaning that a higher average traceability  i.e. a higher relationship between the reference and target populations  will result in lower error rates. We reached the same conclusion  i.e. the imputation error rate was decreased by 0.12% when the average relationship increased by 0.01. Increasing the size of the reference population decreases the probability to miss a haplotype in the reference population. For a fixed reference population size  an increase in the number of effective ancestors  i.e. an increase in the number of haplotypes in the total population  increases the probability to miss a haplotype and thus increases the error rate. This explains why reference population size and number of effective ancestors had opposite effects on imputation accuracy and compensate for each other. In our study  differences in within-breed diversity explain why the error rate was higher in beef breeds than in dairy breeds and why more than 99% accuracy was achieved with only 200 animals for dairy breeds  while 400 animals were necessary for beef breeds. The poor results obtained with the Simmental and Brown Swiss breeds were also due to lower relationships between the reference and target populations; in these breeds  key ancestors mainly originate from abroad and were not included in our data. Combining reference populations from different breeds did not improve imputation accuracy  which confirms the results on multi-breed imputation of Hayes et al. [] and Erbe et al. []. In fact  multi-breed imputation is expected to improve imputation accuracy only when 50K haplotypes are conserved across breeds  which is quite unlikely given the history of the breeds and their estimated divergence time  even for the most closely related breeds. Although observed imputation error rates were low in all breeds  1980 SNPs had particularly high error rates (Figure  and Additional file : Table S1)  which suggests that errors exist in the marker map. Erbe et al. [] identified 1231 SNPs with genotype error rates greater than 20%. When some of these SNPs were remapped using LD  error rates dropped. In our study  no remapping was performed but removing SNPs with high error rates resulted in a 0.1% drop in error rate  which suggests that lower error rates can be achieved with a more accurate map. However  Erbe et al. [] still found 630 poorly imputed SNPs after remapping  which means that other reasons  such as recombination hot spots or regions on the 50K panel with lower SNP density  explain the high imputation error rates for some SNPs. SNPs with high imputation error rates likely also impact the quality of genomic selection and QTL detection. This has not been specifically investigated  but some studies have focused on the impact of imputation from low-density panels on reliability of genomic selection [  ] and concluded that an imputation error rate between 2 and 3% leads to a mean loss of reliability of 2%. For imputation from 50K to the HD chip  the mean error rate is close to 1%  which suggests that the impact on reliability of genomic selection is even lower. However  because of the large number of markers available after imputation  it is preferable to discard markers with high error rates. The mean error rate for imputation from the Illumina Bovine50K to the BovineHD was around 1%. Differences in error rates between breeds were large and ranged from 2.41% in the Simmental breed to 0.31% in the Normande breed. These differences were mainly due to the size of the reference population and the relationship between the reference and target populations. This means that imputation accuracy could be increased by increasing the number of HD genotypes and by improving the reference population to maximize its relationship with the population to impute. Using 50K genotypes to impute HD genotypes is possible  which implies that a large HD imputed reference population can be available for genomic selection at low cost. However  new HD genotypes are likely required in the future generations in order to maintain relationship links between the reference and target populations and limit the imputation error rate.

With the advent of dense genotyping  it is now possible to compute the proportion of the genome that is shared by pairs of sibs and thus undertake the estimation within families  thereby avoiding environmental covariances of family members. Formulae for the sampling variance of estimates have been derived previously for families with two sibs  which are relevant for humans  but sampling errors are large. In livestock and plants much larger families can be obtained  and simulation has shown sampling variances are then much smaller. Based on the assumptions that realised relationship of sibs can be obtained from genomic data and that data are analyzed by restricted maximum likelihood  formulae were derived for the sampling variance of the estimates of genetic variance for arbitrary family sizes. The analysis used statistical differentiation  assuming the variance of relationships is small. The variance of the estimate of the additive genetic variance was approximately proportional to 1/ ()  for  families of size  and variance of relationships . Because the standard error of the estimate of heritability decreased in proportion to family size  the use of within-family information becomes increasingly efficient as the family size increases. There are however  limitations  such as near complete confounding of additive and dominance variances in full sib families. Quantitative genetic parameters such as heritability have traditionally been estimated from the variation among full- or half-sib families  or from the parent-offspring covariance [  ]. The covariance among sibs is assumed to be proportional to the pedigree relationship  but relatives may be further correlated because they share a common environment. This problem arises particularly in humans and  although sire families can be used in livestock to minimise the environmental covariance of sibs  these and weaker relationships come at the cost of higher sampling errors of heritability estimates because the correlation between sibs has to be multiplied by the inverse of the relationship to obtain an estimate of heritability. Estimates of heritability from non-pedigreed populations also rely heavily on getting good estimates of pedigree relationship []  which is difficult unless relationships are very close  and environmental confounding can still a source of bias. Although pairs of full-sibs  for example  share half their genome on average  individual pairs do not because of Mendelian sampling of large chromosome segments. Such a discrepancy at pairs of loci is the basis of QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping using  for example  the method of Haseman and Elston []  to associate the phenotypic divergence between sibs to differences in marker frequency. Dense marker genomes are now available  and Visscher et al. [] proposed that the actual or realised relationships between sibs can be estimated from genomic data and the association between the actual relationship and phenotypic similarity used to estimate the genetic covariance within families  thereby eliminating correlations due to shared environment. Visscher and colleagues used data on human dizygotic twins and full-sibs  first from microsatellites [] and subsequently from SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) [] to estimate the level of genome sharing and thus trait heritability. In a later paper  Visscher [] discussed the theory further. However  the sampling error of the estimates of genetic variance was high because the variation in actual relationship was small (typical standard deviation (SD) of 3.9% of the mean of 50% for human full-sibs  as expected from theory [  –]). Since family sizes in humans are also very small  many are needed for precise estimation. Ødegård and Meuwissen [] pointed out that the method of Visscher et al. [] could be used in very large families  such as for fish species  and for which it is not always practical to avoid rearing full-sibs together. They showed by simulation that sampling errors of the resulting estimates of heritability are substantially reduced as family size increases and are smaller with a few large families than with many small families. These results raise the following basic question: for a family of  sibs  is the information content  i.e. the inverse of the sampling variance of the estimate of heritability  approximately proportional to family size  (or e.g. to  -1) or to the number of pairs in the family  ½( -1)? The simulation results of Ødegård and Meuwissen [] indicated the latter. Furthermore  PM Visscher (personal communication) showed that  using genomic relationships estimated from a sample of  individuals from the population  the sampling variance is a function of . The difference between methods with sampling variances that depend on approximately squares of numbers rather than numbers of individuals is not trivial and clearly has an important impact on their design and potential utility. The model used by Ødegård and Meuwissen [] was based on a finite number (80) of genomic blocks that were individually marked  and with trait effects that were identically normally distributed for each block. In this note  we quantify these estimates and show how they depend on the design and variation in realised relationships. We adopt a model in which the realised relationship is continuous over the genome and with trait effects that are uniformly distributed across the genome. To calculate sampling errors  Visscher et al. [] used regression of the squared phenotypic difference of sibs on the estimated actual relationship from tracking genome segments  whereas Ødegård and Meuwissen [] used a REML (restricted maximum likelihood) analysis within and between families with estimated realised relationships for a finite number of genome segments. In the present analysis the data were assumed to be analysed by REML. Implications for design of experiments are discussed. Let us assume that the data are from matings of unrelated individuals and comprise  (= 1) families each of size  (= 2). The extension to variable  is straightforward and deferred meanwhile. The mean (i.e. pedigree) numerator relationship within families is  (e.g. 0.25 for half-sibs or 0.5 for full-sibs) and the within-family variance of actual relationships is . We also assume that all sibs share the same environment and  for simplicity  as in the work of Visscher et al. [  ]  that additive genetic variance is estimated using only within-family differences; in essence  family effects are regarded as fixed. Therefore information is accumulated independently across families and no bias or sampling error arises due to common environment  albeit at the cost of losing potential between-family genetic information. Initially  we assumed that gene effects were additive but subsequently extended the results to include dominance. The additive genetic variance is   the residual environmental variance is   and so the within-family variance is  = (1 - ) + . The phenotypic variance is given by  =  +  +   where  is the variance due to common environment. In the analysis  it is convenient to parameterise the actual relationship between family members  and  in terms of deviations from mean pedigree-based relationships: <U+2009>=<U+2009> - . The <U+2009>×<U+2009> covariance matrix  of observations  within a family of  sibs is then   where  is the identity matrix and elements of  are     and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. The sampling variance of the parameter estimates can be approximated by using a Taylor series expansion in  because these deviations are small  and then taking expectations so as to obtain Fisher’s information matrix  (the inverse of the variance covariance matrix) for the REML estimates of variance components  and   respectively. The derivation is rather complicated  so details are given in Appendix 1. For a family of size  it is shown that: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>(1 – 2/<U+2009>+<U+2009>2). Since between-family relationships are not used  information  from family  is merely summed over families  with corresponding elements for family size  and   <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …   . The overall variance-covariance matrix of the estimates is: With  families of equal size  from (1): The estimate of the environmental variance is  and hence  and   where  are elements of . Taking just  and  into account    and the sampling error of the corresponding heritability estimate    can be approximated using standard formulae for ratios (see e.g. page 818 in []). Between-family information  not included in the data used above  has to be incorporated to estimate the phenotypic variance and heritability if common family environment or allowance for non-additive effects is to be included. If the quantity  is small  the determinant of  is dominated by its diagonal elements and var () simplifies to: Hence for families of <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 individuals  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and . This corresponds to the formula of Visscher et al. [] for the sampling error of the heritability estimate:   where  is the intra-class correlation of family members. As  increases  ( 1)<U+2009>=<U+2009>( – 3<U+2009>+<U+2009>2 - 2/)<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>( – 3)<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>. If  is small and  large  then var() . The variation in relationships within a family depends on whether family members are full- or half-sibs  on the total map length () of the chromosomes and  to a limited extent  on their individual lengths [    ]. To a good approximation   ~ 1/(16<U+2009>) – 1/(3<U+2009>) for full-sibs and one-half of that for half-sibs [  ]. For humans  the number of autosomes is 22 and the total map length is 35.9 M  so  is approximately 0.00153 for full-sibs and 0.00077 for half-sibs (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.039 and 0.028). Therefore  for full-sib families of a species with a map length and chromosome number similar to humans  SE()<U+2009>~<U+2009>36   e.g. 0.28  for 50 families of size 20 and 0.17  for 20 families of size 50. Cattle  for example  have 29 autosomes and a map length of 32.5 M []  so  would be a little larger and the sampling variance of estimates of heritability correspondingly smaller. In the analysis in Appendix 1  many simplifying assumptions were made in the Taylor series analysis. As a partial check  simulation was undertaken for a model of 22 chromosomes  each 1.632 M long  i.e. the mean length of human chromosomes  and relationships were simulated with the programme used previously to check formulae for variance in relationships []. (The distribution of relationships would be little affected if map lengths varied []). The information matrix  was then computed directly from equation (A1) and from the approximation in Equation (). For simplicity  however  it was assumed that the contrast matrix  (see below equation (A1)) was invariant (see examples in Table ). In general  there was good agreement between the observed and the approximate predicted estimates of sampling variance (Table )  but this deteriorated as family size increased  with the approximation generally underestimating the sampling variance. This bias would be greater if  were higher. Although  if only a single chromosome was fitted  would be much greater  the additive variance contributed by it would be only a fraction of the total and  as the example in Table  shows  the approximation remains good. Table  also gives predictions based solely on Equation ()  showing a good fit with those obtained directly from Equation (). In full-sib families  both additive and dominance variance can  in principle  be estimated. Derivation of the extended information matrix is given in Appendix 2. It depends on the variance  in dominance relationships (about its mean of ¼) and the covariance between dominance and additive relationships  . However  as Visscher et al. [] pointed out  the additive and dominance relationships within families are very highly correlated  since the additive coefficient depends on the average number of paternal and maternal genes that are shared identical by descent at a locus and the dominance coefficient on whether both are shared. The regression of dominance on additive relationships ( / ) is equal to 1 and their correlation is approximately 0.9. This implies that  in practice  partitioning  and  using within-family information is probably not feasible and furthermore that if only an additive model is used  the estimate of  is biased upwards by ; indeed it essentially has expectation . The analysis shows that the sampling variances of estimates of heritability based on within-family realized relationships fall roughly in proportion to  as family size  increases  i.e. based on the number of pairwise comparisons among individuals in the family  and in proportion to the number of families. Therefore  when undertaking such an analysis  it is more efficient to use few very large families  although one might be reluctant to use just one or very few families in case they are atypical []. Here  a model of a continuous genome was used  rather than a finite number of independent regions as by Ødegård and Meuwissen []  and the calculations assumed a fairly even distribution of genetic variance along the genome. If there is much heterogeneity  e.g. a few QTL of large effect  the sampling errors of genetic variance estimates would increase. In the present analysis  we make the assumption that shared segments are identified accurately  for example using Merlin []. Ødegård and Meuwissen [] investigated the effect of selectively genotyping only the individuals with high and low phenotypes within a family  when all phenotypes are included in the REML analysis. The efficiency of this approach was good in terms of sampling errors but estimates of heritability were biased downwards when sample sizes were small. This may reflect insufficient marker coverage of the genes of interest because of lack of linkage disequilibrium  in which case this bias may be hard to avoid  but possibly also bias caused by selection. They also estimated actual relationships from a finite number of markers and  occasionally  obtained a singular matrix in their simulated replicates []. To check the causes  simulated relationships were sampled from a continuous chromosome model [] and the exact allele sharing was computed. Pairs of individuals can inherit identical non-recombinant short chromosomes  thereby yielding a positive semi-definite relationship matrix (i.e. including zero but not negative eigenvalues). In the unlikely event that this occurs at all chromosomes  the data can still be analysed by REML. Negative eigenvalues were not obtained in our simulations and indeed seem infeasible  because the relationships were jointly sampled. Negative eigenvalues are a consequence of the estimation of weak relationships from marker data and might arise in practice. A different approach to estimating the genetic variance free of common environment was suggested by Yang et al. []. They fitted by regression all the SNPs to data from individuals sampled from the population that are not known to be related and from which any pairs with a relationship above a low threshold have been removed  so as to minimise the chance of shared environment. Such an analysis is expected to give a lower estimate of heritability than the within-family analysis discussed here  however  because marker-associated effects in the population can be missed through incomplete linkage disequilibrium  especially when traits genes have low minor allele frequencies  as indeed seems to be the case []. A ‘back of the envelope’ calculation allows a simple comparison of the sampling errors of estimates of additive genetic variance from within families utilising variation in relationship    and from between families using ANOVA   (Appendix 3). Provided the families are not small  . With use of half-sib families (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1/4) to eliminate maternal effects in the between-family estimate  for a genome of ‘human’ length   = (0.25/0.028)<U+2009>~<U+2009>80. Assuming the heritability is 1/3  such that   the ratio of variances is approximately 80/(1<U+2009>+<U+2009>/5)  equalling 1.0 when <U+2009>40. This implies that  with half-sib families of size 40  a similar amount of information would be obtained from within- and between-family data. With fewer larger families  the estimate from within-family information would have the lower standard error. Furthermore  because the within- and between-family estimates use the data in a different way they are  presumably  uncorrelated and so they can be simply combined. However  estimates from both sources may be biased to different extents by common environment  dominance  epistasis  etc.  so specific applications require specific consideration. There are other aspects that could be examined. For example  additive and within-family genetic covariances and correlations among traits can be estimated from a multi-trait analysis with the same data structure. Clearly the magnitude of their sampling errors is structured similarly to those of the corresponding variances of the individual traits. Estimation of variation due to any individual autosome can be achieved by fitting just the relationship on this chromosome  and similarly for the sex chromosome []. The variance of the corresponding relationships is then much higher and depends on the length of the chromosome  decreasing roughly in proportion to its length. Although  per chromosome is then much smaller  the coefficient of variation of its estimate may be similar to that for the whole genome under the simplest assumption that the contribution by any chromosome to  is roughly proportional to its length. A problem specific to the within-family approach is the high degree of confounding between additive and dominance effects in full-sib families (albeit there is also complete confounding in a between full-sib family analysis). This is not resolved by estimating  separately from maternal and paternal sharing  since the dominance coefficient is the correlated intersection of these. The point is that  while maternal genomic similarity appears to include only the additive component because only one sire is involved  interactions between sire and dam effects  i.e. dominance  are included. Half-sib families with multiple dams per sire or a cross classified structure are needed  similar to when between-family correlations are used for estimation. If  for example  a number of males and females are put together for mating in a single environment  then the pedigree can be obtained from genetic markers. Hence  paternal half-sibs  maternal half-sibs and full-sibs can be distinguished and the between-family covariance can be used. Additional information from within-family segregation could be identified via the markers  but this would likely contribute little. For example  in a pen comprising such a diallel structure  the variation in pedigree relationships (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  ¼ or ½) is likely to be much larger than the variation in realised relationships among pairs with the same pedigree relationship. Epistatic variance provides other associated difficulties of potential confounding and estimation. On a whole-genome basis  the relevant coefficient for the additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive variance component is the square of the relationship  which is highly correlated with the additive coefficient. Thus  similar to the analyses between families  obtaining a satisfactory partition between additive and additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive or higher order components is probably not feasible. A further problem is potential bias due to epistatic effects in the estimation of additive (e.g. from additive<U+2009>×<U+2009>additive effects) and dominance variance. Although the expected probability that sibs share alleles at pairs of genomic sites is small for the genome as a whole  it is much higher for nearby sites. Thus  if epistatic effects are substantial and predominately cis-acting  this bias could be important. To partially address this  Visscher et al. [] fitted the mean relationship for each chromosome in a multiple regression model for human height. The variance removed by fitting variation in relationships for each chromosome was essentially the same whether chromosomes were fitted independently or in a joint analysis  indicating little or no interaction between regions on different chromosomes. Extending this more generally needs genomic regions to be defined such that joint identity by descent can be computed. Within-family analysis  particularly when families are large  has attractive features because. it avoids bias due to common environment effects  but it introduces other potential confounding effects  as noted above. It also requires much genotyping and associated costs. Although in a breeding context this type of information may be available when collecting data to implement genomic prediction and subsequent selection  estimates of the variance components may not in themselves have value beyond what is obtained from the marker trait associations. But this is something to think about. For the REML analysis  the information matrix   which in turn yields the sampling variances based on  for the estimates of  and  for each family  is defined by Lynch and Walsh (see page 791 in []): where tr denotes the trace operator. Matrix <U+2009>=<U+2009>’’) and  defines contrasts such that <U+2009>=<U+2009>  where  is the design matrix and  since family members are contemporaneous in the same environment   is a unit vector. The Helmert contrasts are suitable for : for <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …   – 1: <U+2009>=<U+2009>[((<U+2009>1)]  <U+2009>=<U+2009>; <U+2009>=<U+2009>-[(/(<U+2009>1)] and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. Note that  <U+2009>=<U+2009> and   <U+2009>=<U+2009>  where all elements of  equal 1  and (  <U+2009>  . The expected information using the Taylor series expansion has terms of the following form: We note that E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and  assuming independent Mendelian segregation to each offspring  E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>0   and/or  and E() =   where  is the variance in relationship. Differentiating and when evaluated as <U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>  all terms in (A2) become zero. Furthermore  differentiating (A2) to obtain the second derivative  all remaining terms in  are also zero; and as  is linear in   <U+2202><U+2202><U+2202><U+2009>=<U+2009>.

Defining further matrices   where <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and 0 otherwise  and  where <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009><U+2009>1  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …    and 0 otherwise  we have <U+2009>=<U+2009>  <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>  <U+2009><U+2009>2  and tr()<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  tr()<U+2009>=<U+2009>tr()<U+2009>=<U+2009>2. As the trace operator is commutative  it follows that by summing over the ( – 1)/2 off diagonal elements in (A3)  all having the same expectation  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>(1 – 2/<U+2009>+<U+2009>2/). We give less detail for other terms in the information matrix. Non-zero second derivatives must involve differentiation once of  and once of . Hence As the trace is commutative and  is idempotent  putting the last such matrix in (A5) first  we see that: When <U+2009>=<U+2009>  <U+2009>=<U+2009>(1 – 1/)/ and tr(<U+2009>=<U+2009>( – 1)/. Now considering the terms in   with additional terms that become 0 as <U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>. In (A6)  And hence  using the commutative property  Therefore  using previous results  thus completing the derivation of the information matrix in Equation () of the main text. Let  of dimension <U+2009>×<U+2009>  where  for full sib families  . Additive and dominance effects of the loci are assumed to be uncorrelated. Let  with elements  define the departure of the realised dominance correlation of full sibs from the expected ¼  and let  denote var() and similarly  denote cov(  ). The information matrix is now []: The term E[tr(<U+2009>˜<U+2009>( 1) is unchanged from the additive case and  by symmetry  The derivative of the term  with respect to  remains and the expectation of its second derivative with respect to  is unchanged. However  now taking the second derivative with respect to   we obtain additional terms with non zero expectation  and similarly E[tr()] ˜ . The term E[tr()] is non-zero when differentiated twice with respect to  and to  and once each with both variables. Hence The information matrix for a single family is therefore These equations apply to estimates of     and . For full sib families  the estimate of the error variance would be =--  and its sampling error computed accordingly from . As noted in the main text   =  so  simplifies to However  as  and  have similar magnitude   is almost singular and thus the genotypic variance cannot be partitioned into additive and dominance components unless the dataset is very large. Let us assume a balanced one-way ANOVA (which is also REML if there are no unbalanced fixed effects) is used to estimate   i.e.  = ()/() where  and  are the mean squares and  is the pedigree relationship (½ or ¼). It is assumed that there is no environmental correlation among sibs. Hence  with  families each of size      and  as these are uncorrelated  For the within-family estimates   is given by (3). Further simplification requires making some assumptions about numbers and size of families.

For instance  the QTL regions on both fine-mapped chromosomes 7 and Z overlapped with a previously reported QTL for eggshell quality  indicating that eggshell membranes may play a role in albumen quality. Eggs for the table egg market should be microbiologically safe and look good. The number of eggs for processing egg products has increased during recent years  emphasizing the importance of high quality and good processing properties. Good quality albumen has a firm jelly-like structure that keeps the yolk in the center of the egg. Albumen quality starts to degenerate immediately after the egg is laid and thinning is a natural process during storage. For breeding purposes  albumen quality is measured in Haugh units (HU)  expressed as a function of egg weight and the albumen height (AH) of a broken egg []. The egg industry is particularly interested in functional properties such as coagulation and foaming  which makes quality assessment complex []. Genetic background can explain  in part  differences in albumen quality among individuals and breeds []. The average heritability of albumen quality is moderate  reaching 0.30 []. It has also been demonstrated that sires have a higher influence on the heritability of AH and HU than dams  which indicates a sex-linked effect []. Among environmental factors  management and egg storage conditions have a substantial impact on maintaining albumen height  while feed composition has only a minor effect on albumen quality [  ]. Furthermore  viruses in the reproductive tract may lead to the production of watery white eggs and extremely poor quality albumen []. Various causes of albumen deterioration have been suggested. Imperfections can emerge during the early formation of albumen in the reproductive tract but also after oviposition. A potential explanation for the decline in quality with time is linked with eggshell and membrane traits. An intact eggshell with good inner and outer membrane structures plays an important role in albumen quality  particularly during storage  preventing evaporation and escape of metabolic gases through the shell pores. CO leak is known to change albumen pH towards alkaline values []. Albumen quality  among other egg quality and production traits  is a typical quantitative trait that has been studied by QTL mapping. Nevertheless  among the available data on chicken QTL  there are relatively few QTL that affect albumen quality []. In the ChickenQTLdb  16 distinct QTL locations are associated with HU  AH or albumen weight (AW). In the database  QTL regions that influence albumen quality are located on chromosome 1 (HU between positions 48.17 and 53.13 Mb; AH and HU between 90.35 and 123.03 Mb) [  ]  chromosome 2 (HU between 5.31 and15.36 and between 31.23 and 38.97 Mb and AH between 80.69 and 104.34 Mb) [  ]  chromosome 3 (AW at position 106.44 Mb) [] and chromosome 4 (AH and AW at 9.45 Mb  AW between 62.18 and 75.89 and AW at ~80 Mb) [  ]. In addition  genome-wide association studies revealed significant SNP associations on chromosomes 1  3  5  18  19  23 and Z with early or late AH [] and other interesting associations have been reported on chromosomes 7  8  9  14  20 and 24 []. These studies have revealed that several overlapping genomic regions are involved in various egg quality traits  but the relationships between these regions have not yet been detailed at the biological level. Simple text-based searches in the chicken genome [] for genes associated with egg white yielded 20 hits  eight of which referred to known QTL regions  the remainder being annotated albumen related genes  such as  (  chr 1: 37.29 Mb) ( chr 1: 136.64 Mb)   (  chr 2: 59.7 Mb) (  chr 2: 68.85 Mb)   (  chr 2: 129.15 Mb)   (  chr 3: 16.49 Mb) ( chr 4: 47.10 Mb) ( chr 5: 16.121 Mb) (  chr 5: 15.95 Mb) and  (  chr 9: 5.62 Mb). Although studies on the egg albumen proteome have significantly expanded the list of identified albumen proteins [  ]  and the mechanisms involved in egg white thinning have been studied at the protein level []  no causal variations in albumen genes have yet been identified. In this study  we used an F intercross between the two egg-layer lines  White Rock and Rhode Island Red  in order to identify QTL that affect albumen quality. Mapping was performed in three steps: (1) identification of QTL in a small F population  (2) fine-mapping of these QTL in a larger F population  and (3) verification of the QTL in a commercial line  Hy-Line. We also investigated possible links between albumen quality and eggshell properties based on overlapping QTL results in the ChickenQTLdb (on the chicken genome build WASHUC2). For mapping  an F population was created between two commercial egg-layer lines from Lohmann Tierzucht i.e. Rhode Island Red and White Rock. The crossed lines differed in albumen quality; the average HU was 56.31 for Rhode Island Red and 69.29 for White Rock (Table ). Practical management was similar to that used in previous QTL studies []. The full mapping population was made up by reciprocal crosses between 14 Rhode Island Red individuals (six males and eight females) and 15 White Rock individuals (six males and nine females). The F generation consisted of 16 males and 96 females  leading to 16 half-sib families. A genome scan was performed with 162 microsatellite markers spread across 27 of the 39 chicken chromosome pairs using a subset of seven half-sib families with 668 F individuals. The full F mapping population of 1599 individuals was used for fine-mapping. In order to reanalyze the QTL regions  a commercial egg laying chicken population (Hy-Line) was used. The Hy-Line population consisted of 290 males belonging to paternal half-sib families (3.5 males per half-sib family). Albumen quality was evaluated in the F mapping population for three consecutive eggs  each within 24 h of laying  for each hen at the age of 40 weeks. To measure albumen quality  the egg was weighed  broken on a glass plate and the height of the thick albumen (AH) was measured with a micrometer. AH was transformed into Haugh units (HU) with a standardized function of the AH and egg weight  and corrected with a constant []. In the whole-genome scan  only the corrected HU estimations were used  but both AH and HU estimations were used to exclude contribution of the egg weight to the phenotype and to make the different datasets comparable. In the commercial Hy-Line population  albumen quality was assessed by AH twice during the production period i.e. at 26 weeks of age (= early) and again at 42 to 44 weeks of age (= late). The phenotypes are presented as sire-daughter averages and are described in Table . DNA preparation and genotyping of microsatellite markers were carried out as described by Tuiskula-Haavisto et al. []  who also reported marker maps and information contents along the chromosomes. For chromosome 7  genotyping of the entire F mapping population was performed with five microsatellite markers covering 96 cM (MCW361  ADL326  MCW183  MCW236 and ADL315  see Table )  three of which (ADL326  MCW183 and MCW236) were also genotyped in the Hy-Line population. For fine-mapping on chromosome Z  a selected a set of SNP markers covering the QTL region (MCW258-MCW241) were used instead of microsatellite markers. An Illumina BeadXpress [] reader was used to genotype multiplex SNP in both mapping populations  as reported in []. In the F population  20 informative SNP markers were selected for linkage analysis of the QTL regions (Table ). In the Hy-Line population  12 SNP markers were genotyped on chromosome Z  of which six were included in the QTL region (Table ). Because different SNP segregated in the different populations  the marker sets analyzed were not completely identical in the different populations. Marker maps were constructed with CRI-MAP [] using procedures TWOPOINT  BUILD  FLIPS and CHROMPIC. QTL analyses were performed using the least squares method via the web-based GridQTL software []. Significance thresholds for QTL analysis were determined empirically by permutation  and confidence intervals were based on bootstrapping. The length of the chromosomes was taken into account when defining the significance thresholds. More information on the models used and how the significance levels and confidence intervals were derived is available in []. Fine-mapping in the F population used the same software for the chromosome 7 data  whereas a custom-made regression program [] was applied to the chromosome Z data. The significance levels for the linkage analysis were obtained using a permutation procedure as explained in []. For the commercial Hy-Line  microsatellite marker associations were tested with a non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test  because the genotyping data comprised a single generation and linkage analysis could not be applied. Let µ be the trait mean for genotype  in marker  and  = 1 … 3. The total amount of different genotype groups per marker is N and depends on the marker  so that  = 1 … N. The null hypothesis to be tested is then H: µ = µ =…= µ versus: H: µ <U+2260> µ for at least one pair of genotypes  <U+2260> l and  = N. Chromosome Z was analyzed with PLINK []. Data were checked for genotyping quality and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (none of the markers were excluded) before analysis. Basic association testing for quantitative traits and adjustment for multiple comparisons were used. The whole-genome scan using low-density marker maps and seven half-sib families from the mapping population (668 of 1599 F individuals) detected four QTL regions that affect egg white quality (HU) (Table ). A genome-wide significant QTL (p < 0.05) was found on chromosome 7 between microsatellite markers MCW183 and MCW236 (at the genomic positions 24.24 Mb and 29.72 Mb  respectively). The additive effect of the locus was 14.0 HU and accounted for 2% of the phenotypic variance. A highly significant QTL (p < 0.0001) was detected on chromosome Z between microsatellite markers MCW258 and MCW241 (at 21.40 Mb and 34.26 Mb  respectively) [see Additional file ].The effect of this locus was 15.28 HU. A suggestive (5% chromosome-wide) QTL was found on chromosome 4  between markers MCW122 and LEI119 (76.43 and 80.94 Mb  respectively)  which explained 2% of the trait variation  the effect being 12.83 HU. Similarly  a putative QTL was detected on chromosome 26 between markers MCW285 and ADL285 (2.50 and 4.91 Mb  respectively). In contrast to the other identified QTL  this QTL displayed a large dominance effect. Various strategies were used to explore the data in greater detail. Both AH and HU measurements were used in order to eliminate contribution of the egg weight to the phenotype and to allow comparison of different datasets. All 16 half-sib families were genotyped with five microsatellite markers on chromosome 7. Linkage analysis of this full F mapping population increased the resolution and significance of the QTL  reaching the 1% genome-wide significance level (Table ). However  the confidence intervals remained large because of the low-coverage map. The QTL on chromosome Z was fine-mapped using the F population and linkage mapping with 20 SNP markers covering the QTL region. The microsatellite markers originally used were excluded from the analysis in order to avoid bias from heterogeneous information content arising from the two types of markers. Increasing the sample size (to the full mapping population) made it possible to focus on the region containing the QTL in the SNP analysis. The QTL affecting both AH and HU was located in a region between 33.75 and 34.99 Mb  flanked by the markers rs14761341 and rs16767662 (Figure ). The QTL peak co-located with the SNP marker rs14761196. Results for AH and HU were consistent  the only difference being that the result for HU was more significant than for AH (F = 50.73 vs. F = 40.11). We did not find any evidence for a QTL involved in egg weight but the results suggested the presence of QTL that affect eggshell strength (data not shown).  The analysis focused on the QTL region detected previously (chromosome location in cM); the full F mapping population (1599 individuals)  SNP markers (named according to the rs-code) and HU phenotype data were used; the highest F-value for the QTL (50.73) co-located with SNP marker rs14761196. The commercial Hy-Line population was used to confirm the most promising QTL regions  on chromosomes 7 and Z. On chromosome 7  microsatellite ADL326 at position 5.15 Mb was significantly associated with both early and late AH (p = 0.0046 and 0.0024  respectively) between different genotypes [see Additional file ]. Three segregating alleles formed seven genotype classes in the Hy-Line population  with on average 11.5 individuals in each group. On chromosome Z  marker rs16765819 at position 29.09 Mb was significantly associated with early and late AH (p = 0.0003 and 0.004  respectively). This locus was located at the distal end of the QTL region identified with the F population. Although rs16765819 was the outermost studied marker  it was significant in both populations. We used an F intercross between the two egg-layer lines  White Rock and Rhode Island Red  to identify QTL associated with albumen quality and detected four genomic regions on chromosomes 4  7  26 and Z. The QTL on chromosome 26 has not been reported before. Evidence for the QTL on chromosome 4 (between positions 76.43 and 80.94 Mb) is indirectly supported by the QTL reported for albumen weight in two other studies  respectively between positions 62.18 and 75.89 Mb in [] and at 80 Mb in []. The QTL on chromosome 7 between positions 24.24 Mb and 29.72 Mb co-located with the HU40 association reported by Liu et al. []  using two experimental egg-type lines  White Leghorn and dwarf brown layers. This same region overlapped with a QTL that affects eggshell strength between positions 24.25 and 31.83 Mb identified by Sasaki et al. []. In addition to these  Abasht et al. [] detected a significant 3-SNP window for early shell quality at a position between 25.1 and 26.2 Mb. Furthermore  Liu et al. [] identified putative associations with eggshell thickness (EST40) between 27.47 and 29.06 Mb. It should be noted that all these studies used brown layer lines but belonging to different breeds [    ]. Previously  it was shown that the QTL for eggshell thickness [] and shell strength [] at position 35 Mb overlapped on chromosome Z. Our results reveal that the genomic region  around 29–35 Mb  also influences albumen quality. The fact that this region is on chicken chromosome Z agrees with the traditional knowledge that sires have a larger effect than dams on albumen quality []. A positive correlation between albumen and eggshell qualities has been reported []. In addition  several studies have suggested that QTL associated with albumen quality overlap with a shell-related QTL  which cannot be considered as pure coincidence. Two hypotheses can be proposed i.e. either genes common to both albumen quality and eggshell quality exist in these chromosomal regions or the shell-related QTL has pleiotropic effects on albumen quality (or vice versa). One possible common factor connecting albumen quality and shell character is the eggshell membranes  which are waterproof barriers against metabolic gases and water. The outer membrane i.e. cuticle  represents the outermost permeability control []. Barrier properties depend on the shell pores and distribution of the cuticle over the surface of the egg. The cuticle membrane can be partially or totally absent []. Because egg white quality deteriorates during storage  the barrier properties of shell membranes are likely to affect egg white quality significantly  at least after oviposition. According to one theory  egg white thinning is caused by a change in pH in the albumen e.g. []. This alteration arises by the evaporation of gases through the shell. Moreover  the cuticle contributes to eggshell thickness [] and thus the recurrent co-locations of QTL associated with eggshell quality and albumen quality might be explained by the key roles played by the eggshell and membranes to prevent albumen deterioration. According to another theory  multifunctional genes control egg traits such as albumen and shell properties. This multipurpose functioning hypothesis is supported  for instance  by the results of Hincke et al. [] and Jonchere et al. []  who both showed that some egg white proteins are found also in the shell (or shell membranes). Nevertheless  it seems that egg albumen quality and shell traits are connected at the gene level. Many promising candidate genes for albumen quality are present in the QTL regions detected. Some of the most relevant candidates from each QTL region are discussed below. The region detected on chromosome 7 between positions 23 and 30 Mb seems to be important for egg quality traits and includes a cluster of cell shape and adhesion genes  such as  ( 23.38 Mb)   ( 23.73 Mb)   ( 24.09 Mb)  TNS4 ( 24.09 Mb)  ITGB5   29.46 Mb) and  ( 29.51 Mb). In particular   is a very attractive candidate for controlling albumen quality because the ovomucin protein  consisting of mucin subunits  is believed to be responsible for the gel-like structure of the fresh albumen [        ]. The QTL peak on chromosome Z co-located with SNP marker rs14761196 at position 33.99 Mb that lies within an uncharacterized gene  . This gene is expressed widely in reproductive and secretory tissues. Both the independent commercial Hy-Line population and the F mapping population showed a very significant association with marker rs16765819 at position 29.09 Mb on chromosome Z that is located in the border region of the QTL. Marker rs16765819 is located near to the  (). Other putative candidate genes near the QTL peak are  for instance   (.9 Mb)  which plays a role in mucin biosynthesis (KEGG entry 427260) and  ( 39.4 Mb)  which is required during protein degradation. The number of SNP on chromosome Z differed between the populations studied. Within the QTL region fine-mapped on chromosome Z  six SNP were informative in the Hy-Line population  but only three of these were common in the two mapping populations. Although this complicates comparisons and interpretation of the results between the populations  our results were in line and were unambiguous for the commercial line. Clusters of significantly associated markers  as on chromosomes 7 and Z  could be due either to a high number of causative polymorphisms or to a single causative polymorphism in the region with a high level of LD []. The effect of each associated SNP in the cluster might have a small effect  but within the region  the haplotypes could have a large overall effect on the trait studied. Many results suggest that accumulation of variations at the same locus is a relatively common mechanism []. We identified four genomic regions that affect albumen quality in chicken of which those on chromosomes 4 and 26 are novel. The QTL on chromosomes 7 and Z overlapped with previously identified QTL for shell quality  which suggests the existence of possible common factors for both albumen and shell quality. The results of this study are congruent with the general assumption that multi-factorial causes are involved in egg albumen thinning. The genes that control albumen quality are diverse and act either directly or indirectly via different mechanisms. Egg white thinning is an intricate process that can take place anywhere during the process  starting from albumen formation in the magnum to egg storage after oviposition.

The benefit of adding data from other breeds to a within-breed training population is the ability to produce molecular breeding values that are more robust across breeds and these can be utilized until enough training data has been accumulated to allow for a within-breed training set. One key advantage of genomic predictors is that they can be estimated early in the life of the animal and thus allow for increased accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV)  particularly for young animals  which have not yet produced progeny. However  the benefit of the inclusion of genomic predictions into EBV estimates is proportional to the amount of genetic variation that is explained by the genomic predictor []. To date  in beef cattle  the American Angus Association []  Australian Angus Association  American Hereford Association []  American Brahman Breeders Association []  Australian Brahman Breeders Association []  and American Simmental Association [  ] exploit molecular information in their National Cattle Evaluations and associations for other breeds are moving towards this goal. Although the efficacy of within-breed trained genomic predictors looks promising [–]  it is necessary to develop and evaluate across-breed predictors for the technology to be fully applied in the beef industry. Simulation studies have reported the efficacy of genomic predictors trained in one breed and utilized to predict genetic merit in differing breeds  as well as the efficacy of predictors trained using data from multiple breeds and then used to predict the genetic merit of purebreds that were either included or excluded from training data [–]. De Roos and colleagues [] showed that by combining training populations  more accurate genomic predictions could be developed  particularly when the subpopulations had not diverged for more than a few generations and for lowly heritable traits. However  research in dairy cattle has shown that when the subpopulations diverged  genomic predictors from a multi-breed training population did not have higher accuracy than predictors from single-breed training sets  except when evaluation occurred in a breed that was not represented in the training set  in which case adding multiple breeds increased the accuracy of predictors  compared to using a single-breed training set []. Work in other species [] has shown that population structure can account for a substantial portion of the accuracy of genomic predictors but accounting for this structure can decrease the reliability of across-breed genomic predictors. Our objectives were to derive and evaluate genomic predictors using genotypes from the Illumina (San Diego  CA) BovineSNP50 platform for growth traits (weaning and yearling weights) in single-breed and multi-breed training data sets and evaluate them on field data. A total of three within-breed and two across-breed training populations were used: A multiple-breed training population  which will be referred to as the MB population  that included five breeds (Angus  Hereford  Limousin  Red Angus  and Simmental) from a database containing 50K genotypes assembled from purebred beef cattle breeds. Animals in the database were primarily artificial insemination (AI) sires that had a substantial influence on their respective breeds and EBV with reasonably high accuracies. The only exception was the Limousin breed  for which a large number of DNA samples originated from previous DNA testing  such that only about 58% of the genotyped animals were AI sires. The MBV were trained on de-regressed EBV [] (including weights to account for variable accuracy) for all five breeds together. Breed was fitted in the model as a fixed effect because EBV used in the training set were provided separately by each breed association  each using their own genetic base. In order to achieve a reasonable degree of independence  this training subset excluded any animal that was in the evaluation population. Single-breed Angus (AN)  Hereford (HH)  or Limousin (LM) subsets that contributed to the MB MBV  collectively referred to as the single-breed training population (SB). The difference between MB and SB is that training was performed separately for each breed  as opposed to simultaneously for all five. The MBV trained on these single-breed training sets were computed both for subsets of the evaluation population that included the same breeds as the training set and subsets that included different breeds. A multiple-breed training population consisting of AI sires from 13 breeds with high accuracy EBV and referred to as MB_2K. De-regressed EBV (adjusted for base differences and including weights to account for variable accuracy) were treated as phenotypes for training  following the methods of []. Due to the heterogeneity of breed-specific variance components  de-regressed breeding values and their associated weighting factors were scaled to standardize genetic variance as described by []. This training set represents a published across-breed prediction set from the US Meat Animal Research Center 2000 Bull Project []  and was used for comparison with the MB MBV presented here. The MB_2K training set had 16 Limousin animals in common with the MB and Limousin SB sets. This small degree of overlap between the training sets was due to some animals having been genotyped by more than one research institution  since the data used for training the MB and SB sets did not include genotypes from the 2000 Bull Project. The numbers of animals per breed in the SB  MB and MB_2K sets are presented in Table . For each trait  there were five training analyses (SB AN  SB HH  SB LM  MB  MB_2K). Each training analysis resulted in a prediction equation (a vector of estimated additive allelic effects corresponding to each SNP on the 50K chip)  from which an MBV for each genotyped animal in the evaluation population could be computed. Genomic prediction equations were derived using GenSel []  delivered via the Bioinformatics to Implement Genomic Selection (BIGS) platform (). No pre-analysis filtering of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) based on minor allele frequency (MAF) was performed. The MB_2K predictions used a BayesCp model []. The MB and SB predictions used a BayesC model with p set to 0.99 because the US beef industry (i.e.  American Simmental Association and American Hereford Association) applied this approach to derive the genomic predictors that are included in National Cattle Evaluations. The de-regressed EBV for a genotyped individual was modeled as the sum of a fixed breed effect  the SNP effects times its genotype covariates  plus a random residual with variance s/W  with W weights from []. The SNP effects had a prior distribution where a SNP effect was zero with probability p or was sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a SNP effect variance of s with probability 1-p. The SNP effect variance and the residual variance had scaled inverse Chi-squared prior distributions. Parameter p had a uniform (0 1) prior distribution in the BayesCp model  but was assumed known in the BayesC model. The evaluation population consisted of genotyped animals from seven breeds in the herds of 24 seedstock producers from the Northern Plains region of the US plus any genotyped animals in their 4-generation pedigrees. The numbers of genotyped animals in the evaluation populations are summarized in Table . When evaluating the MB_2K MBV  animals in the evaluation population that were included in the MB_2K training set  had their MBV excluded from the analysis. Data was either extracted from existing breed association databases or using DNA samples extracted from semen or hair samples and did not require an approved animal use and care protocol. The accuracies of the various MBV trained as described above  were evaluated based on the estimated genetic correlations between each of those MBV and the corresponding phenotypes in the evaluation population. Correlations were estimated using bivariate mixed linear models in which the traits were the MBV and the corresponding phenotypic trait. The genetic correlations between the trait and MBV reflect the accuracies of MBV since the square of these correlations represents the proportion of genetic variance explained by the genomic information [          ]. The field data from the evaluation population contained weaning and yearling weights from 48 158 and 46 429 animals born in 2008 or later  respectively  with 128 050 animals in the pedigree  of which 2277 were genotyped and therefore had MBV. The average accuracy of the EBV of genotyped animals ranged from 0.44 for yearling weight in the Limousin breed to 0.84 for weaning weight in the Charolais breed. The model for the phenotypic trait in the bivariate model included fixed effects for contemporary group  breed composition  and heterosis  and random direct and maternal additive genetic effects. An effect of heterosis was expected in some breeds if the breed association previously had an open herd book or currently registers composite animals (i.e.  American Simmental Association’s Hybrid evaluation  American Gelbvieh Association’s Balancers  North American Limousin Foundation’s LimFlex program). The heterosis effect was modeled as a direct effect using three covariates for the proportions of the animal’s British x   British x Continental  and  x Continental breed composition. The model for MBV included a fixed effect for the intercept and a random direct genetic effect with the variance-covariance matrix proportional to the numerator relationship matrix. The environmental variance for MBV was fixed at 0.01% of the environmental variance of the phenotypic trait  and environmental covariances between the MBV and trait phenotype were assumed to be zero. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the variance components were obtained using ASReml []. Variance components for weaning and yearling weights were also estimated using single-trait linear mixed models based only on phenotypic data. Typical values for a collection of genetic correlations are reported based on the interquartile range that captures the middle 50% of the estimates. Genetic parameters for weaning and yearling weights estimated using single-trait analyses of the evaluation population field data from 24 herds are presented in Table . In general  heritability estimates were moderate to high and within the range of the estimates reported in the literature and summarized by Koots et al. []  although some of the estimates of direct-maternal genetic correlations are greater than expected based on literature []. Estimates of genetic correlations between each MBV from the SB populations and its corresponding phenotypic trait are presented in Table . The MBV evaluated in this project generally accounted for less than 25% of the genetic variation (r) in weaning and yearling weights (Table ). The estimated genetic correlations for the SB AN-trained MBV for weaning (0.36±0.07) and yearling (0.51±0.07) weights were similar to previously reported estimates i.e. ranging from 0.33 to 0.52 for weaning weight and from 0.34 to 0.64 for yearling weight [  ]. With the exception of the SB HH-trained yearling weight MBV evaluated in Hereford  within-breed genetic correlations evaluated in the same breed as used for training were greater than 0.28  with typical values ranging from 0.36 to 0.42. However  the SB HH-trained yearling weight MBV performed poorly when evaluated in the same breed  with an estimated genetic correlation of 0.06±0.22. This may be an artifact of the fact that all Hereford field data used in evaluation were from a single herd. Figure  contains box plots of the genetic correlations of SB MBV with phenotypes  evaluated either in the same breed as that used for training or in a different breed. Unlike the moderate genetic correlations obtained when the within-breed MBV were evaluated in the same breed as used for training  the genetic correlations tended to be more variable and were centered close to zero when evaluation was in a different breed. The smaller genetic correlations are consistent with the expectation that the predictive power of the MBV decreases as the genetic distance between the animals used in training and evaluation increases [    ] and implies that within-breed trained MBV are of minimal value for the genetic evaluation of other breeds.  MBV were evaluated either in the same breed used for training or in a different breed. Training excluded animals in the pedigrees of the field data evaluation population bulls. Estimates of the genetic correlations between MB MBV and corresponding phenotypic traits are in Table . For breeds with both SB and MB MBV  the estimated genetic correlations tended to be similar (Figure )  which suggests that either could be used with similar levels of efficacy. Considering the large contribution of AN to the training set  the estimated genetic correlations for the SB and MB trained MBV were very similar. However  based on Table   the use of an MB trained MBV in a breed that was not included in the training data  is not advisable.  Traits were weaning weight (WWT) and yearling weight (YWT) and were evaluated in Angus (AN)  Hereford (HH)  or Limousin (LM).Within-breed trained MBV were evaluated in the same breed as used in training. The breeds evaluated here represent populations that have diverged over many generations  approximately 200 years since breed formation occurred. Previous work by Pryce et al. [] using the Holstein  Jersey  and Fleckvieh breeds showed that combining divergent subpopulations in the training set does not improve the accuracy of genomic predictors over within-breed derived predictors. Pryce et al. [] reported that the accuracy of the predictors for milk genomic breeding values in Holstein based on training in Fleckvieh was equal to 0.22 but increased to 0.42 when a second breed (Jersey) was added to the training set  which suggests that the addition of several other breeds to the training set to predict a breed that was not in the training set is beneficial. However  the same results were not consistently seen here. Typical values for the estimated genetic correlations for the MB_2K MBV across the seven breeds ranged from 0.25 to 0.35 for weaning weight and from 0.15 to 0.50 for yearling weight. These estimates are slightly lower than previously reported for within-breed trained MBV for growth traits [  ]. Similar to the SB trained MBV results  estimates of genetic correlations for MB trained MBV were close to zero when evaluated in a breed that was not included in the training set (Table ). For the two breeds (Charolais and Gelbvieh) not included in the MB training set  estimated genetic correlations for Gelbvieh tended to be low to moderate. The robustness of the MB trained MBV in Gelbvieh could be due to it having closer genetic ties with breeds included in training via crossbred animals in the pedigrees. However  the average AN contribution to the Gelbvieh evaluation data was only 8.45%. When evaluated in the same breed as used for training  SB trained MBV for weight traits based on the BovineSNP50 have higher accuracy than EBV based only on pedigree and performance information. Scatter plots of the relationship between MBV obtained from the SB and MB populations in Angus  Hereford  and Limousin breeds are presented in Figure  for weaning weight and in Figure  for yearling weight. Results show a strong linear association between the SB and MB trained MBV when applied to the same breed as used for training the SB MBV. This indicates that  on an individual breed basis  the SB and MB MBV account for much of the same variability in that breed.  Within-breed MBV trained in Angus (AN)  Hereford (HH)  and Limousin (LM) and evaluated in animals in the field data set of either the same or different breed.  Within-breed MBV trained in Angus (AN)  Hereford (HH)  and Limousin (LM) and evaluated in animals in the field data set of either the same or different breed. There was a reduction in the proportion of genetic variance explained (r)  and thus a reduction in the variability of MBV among animals  when SB MBV were applied to animals from a different breed (Table )  illustrating that these MBV do not separate animals in terms of genetic merit because they do not account for a substantial portion of the genetic variance. The decrease in variability indicates that SNPs that explained variability well in the training breed did not in another breed  even in a closely related breed. This result is consistent with the finding of Gibbs et al. [] that haplotypes longer than 250 kb are conserved across closely related breeds []. An alternative explanation is that some breeds may be more diverse  i.e. having a greater number of haplotypes and low frequencies of these haplotypes. Furthermore  due to selection or drift  some breeds may be fixed  or close to fixation  for certain SNPs. The greater robustness of the MB trained MBV in explaining genetic variation across breeds compared to the SB trained indicate that there are multiple collections of SNPs that can capture the underlying genetic variability and that the addition of other breeds to the training set allows the model to select the collection of SNPs that works best across multiple breeds. The average model incorporation frequencies  i.e. the proportion of iterations of the MCMC chain with which an individual SNP enters the model  were within 0.0012 of the prior model frequency of 0.01 = 1 - p for all SNPs and for each MBV. The numbers of SNPs with model frequencies and effects that exceeded various thresholds are presented in Table  and Table . The number of SNPs in the SB trained MBV that exceeded the prior model frequency of 0.01 was greater than that in the corresponding MB trained MBV. However  within the reduced set of SNPs in the MB trained MBV that exceeded the prior model frequency threshold  there were more SNPs that had moderate to high model frequencies. While there were relatively few SNPs with large effects  the number of SNPs in the MB trained MBV with moderate to large effects was greater than in the SB trained MBV. The fact that an MB trained MBV identified a smaller set of SNPs with greater model frequencies and effects than the SB trained MBV is also consistent with the hypothesis that one consequence of adding breeds to the training set is to reduce the number of informative SNPs in the Bayes C algorithm. This decrease in the number of informative SNPs may also be due to the greater number of animals in the MB training data compared to the SB training data  resulting in a decrease in the noise associated with sampling in the MCMC algorithm. As suggested by []  one benefit of adding breeds to the training set is the possibility of identifying SNPs that are in strong linkage disequilibrium with the QTL and with an allelic phase that is preserved across multiple breeds. Although this might help to identify important genomic regions harboring QTL  it is not associated with a noticeable increase in accuracy of MBV. The similar performance in individual breeds of SB and MB trained MBV supports the fact that common QTL are tracked across multiple breeds. If common QTL were not tracked  we would have expected a drop in performance when adding data from other breeds  because that would simply add noise to the data. The increase in the number of SNPs with high model frequencies and large effects in the across-breed trained MBV also supports the conclusion that common QTL are being tracked across breeds  since effects that were spread across several SNPs in each within-breed trained MBV are being assigned to a smaller set of SNPs across breeds. The MB trained MBV were  however  not consistently better than SB trained MBV. The accuracy of within- or across-breed trained MBV are substantially lower for breeds that are not included in the training set  since the estimated genetic correlations between trait MBV and their corresponding phenotypes cluster around zero. This is true even for breeds that are closely related  such as Angus and Red Angus. The addition of training data from other breeds produces an MBV where the SNP effects are concentrated onto a smaller set of informative SNPs. However  the accuracy of the across-breed trained MBV is similar to the within-breed trained MBV.

Genomic information can provide additional information for selection and/or allow for a strong reduction in the generation interval. In this study  a typical conventional layer breeding program using a four-line cross was modeled and the expected genetic progress was derived deterministically with the software ZPLAN+. This non-genomic reference scenario was compared to two genomic breeding programs to determine the best strategy for implementing genomic information in layer breeding programs.ResultsIn scenario I  genomic information was used in addition to all other information available in the conventional breeding program  so the generation interval was the same as in the reference scenario  i.e. 14.5 months. Here  we assumed that either only young cocks or young cocks and hens were genotyped as selection candidates. In scenario II  we assumed that breeders of both sexes were used at the biologically earliest possible age  so that at the time of selection only performance data of the parent generation and genomic information of the selection candidates were available. In this case  the generation interval was reduced to eight months. In both scenarios  the number of genotyped male selection candidates was varied between 800 and 4800 males and two sizes of the calibration set (500 or 2000 animals) were considered. All genomic scenarios increased the expected genetic gain and the economic profit of the breeding program. In scenario II  the increase was much more pronounced and even in the most conservative implementation led to a 60% improvement in genetic gain and economic profit. This increase was in all cases associated with higher breeding costs.ConclusionsWhile genomic selection is shown to have the potential to improve genetic gain in layer breeding programs  its implementation remains a business decision of the breeding company; the possible extra profit for the breeding company depends on whether the customers of breeding stock are willing to pay more for improved genetic quality."

Breeding of layers for commercial egg production is an international business and is dominated by a few companies. The marketable product of these companies is the breeding stock that subsequently is used to produce laying hens in various production systems. In egg production  the profit margins are extremely tight  especially with the increasing feed prices and changing production systems[]. The strong competition on the market for laying hens also contributes to a substantial economic pressure. In such a highly competitive market  the strategy of a breeding company with regard to allocation of resources needs to be continuously optimized and monitored in order to maintain its competitiveness and market share on the global market. Breeding of commercial laying hens is based on the pool of nucleus lines of a breeding company. Selection is done within closed purebred lines and is based on a comprehensive phenotyping scheme  both in pure line birds under highly standardized housing conditions  and in crossbred hens under housing conditions that are closer to the production environment of the end product. The age at selection in both sexes depends on the age when the performance of the hens is recorded. In current breeding schemes  cocks and hens are usually selected at one year of age or slightly older. Biologically  both cocks and hens could be used for reproduction much earlier since they achieve their sexual maturity at about five months of age. The benefit of genomic selection over conventional selection strategies was first reported for dairy cattle. This expected benefit is due to the reduction in the generation interval  the increase in accuracies of the estimated breeding values of young bulls and bull dams  and the reduction in costs for progeny testing young bulls[  ]. Based on these theoretical findings  genomic selection was rapidly implemented in dairy cattle breeding programs[]. The breeding structures and the biological conditions in layer breeding programs differ strongly from those in dairy cattle breeding programs in many aspects. Therefore  optimum breeding strategies for the implementation of genomic selection in layer breeding programs must be designed and their comparative advantages must be assessed. Some studies showed the possibility to reduce generation interval in layer breeding programs by implementing genomic selection e.g.[  ]. Among farm animals  the genome of the chicken was the first to be completely sequenced[]. By 2006  Abasht et al.[] had already reviewed 50 articles on quantitative trait loci identified in chicken. However  in practical breeding programs  marker-assisted selection has been implemented only for a few traits  e.g. fishy taint in brown layers[] and susceptibility to Marek´s disease[]. Currently  an array comprising about 60 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (60k Illumina SNP BeadChip) is available for the chicken[]. The objectives of this study were to present a methodology for the economic evaluation and optimization of genomic selection programs. Towards this aim  we evaluated the potential benefits of genomic selection approaches in an existing layer crossbreeding program as an example for breeding programs with complex structures and breeding goals. A conventional breeding program based on a four-line cross was used as a reference. We implemented two genomic selection scenarios; in scenario I  genomic information was used in addition to the phenotypic information available at selection; in scenario II  early selection based on a combination of parental and genomic information was used. In both scenarios  additional parameters such as the size of the calibration set and the number of genotyped selection candidates were varied. We discuss the results both with respect to expected genetic progress on the level of single or combined traits  as well as on an economic scale. Here  the balance of expected costs and returns is delicate and different aspects of the practical implementation of genomic selection in commercial layer breeding programs will be addressed. The software ZPLAN+[] was used to compare conventional crossbreeding programs with breeding programs using genomic information. This software allows modeling of all relevant breeding structures  while taking all relevant biological  technological and economic parameters for complex breeding programs into account. ZPLAN+ is based on the gene flow theory[]  the selection index by Hazel and Lush[]  as well as on a complex modeling of costs and returns. ZPLAN+ is based on a similar conceptual approach as the software ZPLAN[] but has many additional features (such as the possibility to model genomic information) and a more appropriate web-based user interface. Like ZPLAN  it deterministically calculates the expected genetic trend and the discounted economic gain and profit over a defined planning horizon. The monetary results in ZPLAN+ are standardized to an animal unit and are given per year. We defined the selected animals in the four lines and all grandparental animals as basis for the standardization  which resulted in a total number of animals equal to 127 640. To model a breeding program in ZPLAN+  input parameters to define the biological aspects and the breeding processes must be specified. All traits that are either recorded and/or part of the breeding goal must be specified. For each trait  heritability  phenotypic standard deviation  economic value and genotypic correlations to all other traits must be given. Phenotypic correlations are only required between the traits that are actually measured for the birds in the same environment. The breeding goal is implicitly defined by assigning economic weights to all or a subset of the defined traits. For each trait  the different information source groups (e.g. full sib groups) and the traits that are recorded for these must be defined. This includes specifying the number of individuals in the group  the number of repeated measurements of each trait  and the additive-genetic relationships within the group and with the selection candidates. The animals in the breeding program are divided into selection groups. A selection group is a group of animals having the same sex and ancestry. For each selection group  the following information has to be provided: the breeding goal for the group  the information source groups available for each selection candidate  the number of tested and selected animals  the variable costs for each tested animal  the age at first reproduction  and the productive lifetime. ZPLAN+ provides a comprehensive set of results. For each selection path  the genetic gain is computed as the product of the accuracy of the selection index  the selection intensity and the standard deviation of the breeding goal in this path of selection. The discounted variable costs are calculated across the selection groups. Discounted variable costs plus discounted fixed costs result in total costs. The discounted return of a selection path is obtained as the monetary genetic gain weighted by its corresponding Standardised Discounted Expression (SDE) value. The SDE value of a selection path includes the proportion of animals that realize the genetic gain  the point in time of realization  and the amount of the genetic gain provided by this selection group over all generations within the planning horizon. The total discounted return is the sum of returns over all selection paths. The profit is the total discounted return minus the total discounted costs and is expressed per animal unit in the breeding program. The general concept of ZPLAN+ is based on assessing the accumulated effect of a single round of selection; therefore a reduction in the genetic variance with recurrent selection  the so-called Bulmer effect[]  is not modeled explicitly. However  since the genetic parameters are taken from an ongoing breeding program  the reduction in genetic variance due to the Bulmer effect is implicitly accounted for. A commercial layer crossbreeding program with four nucleus lines (A  B  C and D) was modeled in ZPLAN+ for a planning period of ten years (Reference Scenario). In these four lines  the selection process relied on a combination of information measured in the purebred birds at the breeding unit and on information captured from crossbred half-sibs under commercial conditions. From the pure lines  the grandparent generation (grandparents of the production hens) was hatched in a first multiplication step. In the parent generation  the cocks were a cross of lines A and B  while the hens were a cross of lines C and D. This resulted in 500 000 cocks and 5.10 hens in the parental generation. The cross of this parental generation finally produced 500.10 laying hens for egg production. The complete breeding scheme is presented in Figure .  GP = Grand Parents; P = Parents. Each pure line comprised the same number of animals. In each line and generation  600 hens and 60 cocks were used. A pre-selection after rearing was carried out on the basis of parental information. Four thousand female chicks to be housed on the breeding farms were selected from 4800 reared chicks. The 4000 selected hens were then tested in single cages over 32 weeks from age 20 to 51 weeks  to finally select 500 hens based on an index combining parental information with own  full- and purebred half-sib performance. In addition  1500 hens per line were tested in group cages (three full- or half-sib hens per cage)  from which an additional 100 hens per line were selected. The selection of 60 cocks per line from 800 male chicks was based on parental information plus the following information on relatives: 8 purebred full-sibs and 65 pure-bred half-sibs in single cages  4 purebred full-sibs and 20 pure-bred half-sibs in group cages  30 crossbred half-sibs in a practical environment. To produce the 30 crossbred half-sibs  cocks of lines A and B were mated with hens of lines C or D  resulting in crossbred hens of genotype AC  AD  BC or BD  which were tested in the practical environment. The 60 selected cocks and 600 selected hens per line were used to produce the new purebred generation. All hens  including those not selected  were maintained during the entire production cycle to have information on the late laying performance for the next generation. The breeding goal comprised performance and functional traits. The selection indexes for the purebred hens in single or group cages and the hens in the practical environment included 22 traits (Table ). The laying performance was split in four time periods. Table S1 [See Additional file: Table S1] provides the relative economic weights (ew)  phenotypic standard deviations  heritabilities  and genetic and phenotypic correlations of all 22 traits. These parameters were based on a breeding program for laying hens from the Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH. Note that the sign of the economic weight indicates the desired direction of genetic change in the respective trait (e.g. for feed consumption and mortality  a negative economic weight indicates that a numerical reduction of the trait level was desirable). While ZPlan+ requires economic weights in € per genetic standard deviation  the values in Table S1 [See Additional file: Table S1] are scaled to 100 to allow a direct assessment of the relative values of traits in the breeding goal. The variable costs of rearing a cock or a hen over a period of 20 weeks were assumed to be €11 per animal. During production  daily feeding costs resulted from a feed consumption of 0.11 kg per day at a price of €0.3 per kg. For each cock and hen  additional costs for the cage unit (€5) and animal care (€5) were assumed. Performance testing caused additional costs of €5 per hen. Since it was difficult to quantify additional fixed costs that may be associated with decisions on the breeding structures (e.g. the cost of a new performance test unit when the population size is increased)  we included no fixed costs in the reference scenario. This has no influence on the comparison of alternative scenarios if we assume that they are indifferent with respect to the population size. However  it must be kept in mind that fixed costs have to be paid from the resulting profit. The considered time frame was set to ten years (i.e. ten breeding cycles). The interest rate was set to 7% for discounted costs and 2% for discounted returns. In order to evaluate and compare the different scenarios for the breeding programs  results reported include genetic gain in each trait  total monetary genetic gain  generation interval  and the discounted economic parameters of returns  costs and profit. To allow for a better comparison  we set the values obtained for the reference scenario (conventional breeding program) to 100% and expressed the results obtained with the alternative genomic scenarios relative to these reference values. In ZPLAN+  a genomic counterpart trait for each conventional trait is defined to be the genomic estimated genomic breeding value (GEBV) for that trait  based on the given calibration set size. The background for implementing genomic information in the selection index on this basis was developed by Dekkers[] and modified by Haberland et al.[]. This approach requires the correlation of the true and the GEBV to define for every genomic trait. This is done using the approach by Erbe et al.[] based on an equation derived by Daetwyler et al.[  ]: where  is the size of the calibration set   is a calibration factor  is the reliability of the GEBV of the animals used in the calibration set  and  is the number of independently segregating chromosome segments  which was derived by Goddard[] as: where  is the effective population size  which was assumed to be 60 per line and  is the length of the genome in Morgan which was set to 32  based on Groenen et al.[]  leading to  = 429. The calibration factor  reflects the accuracy of GEBV that is hypothetically obtained with a calibration set of infinite size using the given SNP density. Erbe et al.[] empirically determined this factor to be  ~ 0.9 for different traits in dairy cattle and for GEBV from a 50k SNP chip. Since for layers  this quantity is unknown  we also assumed  ~ 0.9  but it will be necessary to determine  from empirical data once they are available. We modeled two different genomic scenarios: Scenario I: in this scenario  the genomic information of cocks or both sexes was added to all other information that is available in the reference scenario but all selection decisions were made at the same time as in the reference scenario. Scenario II: this scenario assumed that selection takes place at the biologically earliest possible stage  so that only parental and genomic information is available for different numbers of cocks and for all 6300 reared hens. Selected animals were used for breeding by eight months of age. For re-calibration of the genomic information and the production of the grandparental generation  hens were kept and fully performance tested until 72 weeks of age. In both genomic scenarios  the number of genotyped cocks was varied between 800 and 4800 animals per purebred line in steps of 800  while the number of selected cocks was kept constant at 60. While in the conventional scheme all full-sibs have the same EBV and drawing one animal from a group at random is the best one can do  it is possible to select between full-sibs when GEBV are available. As an alternative for scenario I  we assumed that all 6300 reared hens were also genotyped and this additional information was used for dam selection. The variable costs for genotyping an animal were assumed to be €150. The total cost to implement GEBV estimation was €150 multiplied by the number of animals in the calibration set  which was assumed to equal 500 or 2000 animals. These costs were fixed costs for the genomic breeding programs and were divided by the time horizon of ten years. All incurred variable costs were accounted for in the same way as in the reference scenario. The generation interval in the reference scenario was 14.5 months for each line. The accuracy of the selection index at the time of selection was <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51 for cocks  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.53 for hens tested in single cages  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51 for hens tested in group cages. The genetic gain per year for each trait is in Table . The discounted return per animal unit in the reference scenario was €282.17 per year. The variable costs were €17.19 per animal unit  which resulted in a profit of €264.98 per animal unit. With 5.10 laying hens on the reproduction level realizing the genetic progress obtained in the breeding nucleus  we have 3917 production hens per animal unit in the breeding nucleus  resulting in a profit of €0.07 per laying hen. Note that this profit does not include fixed costs  so these will have to be covered from this profit. In this scenario  the genomic information was added in the reference scenario at the time of selection. Neither the generation interval nor the costs for the performance testing of the hens were reduced. The returns increased with the number of tested cocks and with an increasing number of animals in the calibration set (Figure ). Total costs scaled with the number of genotyped animals. The number of animals in the initial calibration set had no significant impact on the total costs  since these costs are distributed over the whole period considered  i.e. ten years and over all animals that receive the accumulated genetic gain. Compared to the reference scenario  the profit was higher for all numbers of tested cocks (€278.93 – €391.37 per animal unit) although there was a decreasing marginal increase in profit with increasing numbers of genotyped cocks. The latter is because adding more cocks increases genotyping costs linearly but the extra benefit from increasing selection intensity increases at a lower rate. With a calibration set of 500 animals  genotyping both sexes resulted in a marginally lower profit than genotyping cocks only.  Results with genotyping of cocks (left panels) and both cocks and hens (right panels) are compared to the reference scenario (Ref; returns set to 100%) for two calibration set sizes. To compare the expected genetic gain for individual traits between scenarios  we used the six traits of the crossbred hens in the practical environment  since this is the type of production that is closest to the production system for which the hens are selected. In Figure   the predicted genetic change for these six traits is shown relative to the predicted change for the reference scenario. The gain for laying performance increased for all laying periods  with the highest gain for the second period  for which the genetic gain was doubled when a calibration set of 2000 cocks was used and 4000 cocks were genotyped for selection. Genetic gain in egg weight decreased slightly when only a few cocks were genotyped for selection and reached the same level as in the reference scenario only when 4000 or more cocks were genotyped for selection. With 2000 animals in the calibration set  the genetic gain was greater than with 500 animals but ranking of traits remained the same. In all cases  a considerable genetic improvement in mortality was observed. Adding the genotyping of hens increased genetic gain for all traits except egg weight (data not shown). In particular  genetic gains in laying performance and mortality benefitted from the additional genomic information. The additional increase in egg shell stability was only marginal and the genetic gain in egg weight was lower than when only the cocks were genotyped.  LP1: laying performance 1  LP2: laying performance 2  LP3+4: laying performance 3 and 4  EW: egg weight  ESS: egg shell strength and M: mortality; genetic gain relative to the reference scenario (set to 100%) with different numbers of genotyped cocks and different sizes of the calibration set. In scenario II  the generation interval was reduced to eight months. By assuming that performance testing of hens continued after selection  the costs related to performance testing were not reduced. The returns  costs and profit are shown relative to the reference scenario in Figure . The figure shows that with a calibration set of 2000 animals  the returns can be doubled  even with very few (800) male animals genotyped for selection. With the initially more realistic number of 500 animals in the calibration set  the returns increased by 60 to over 100% with 800 to 4800 cocks genotyped. The costs increased with increasing numbers of animals genotyped. With the lowest number of genotyped cocks  the costs were three times greater than in the reference scenario (€48.84 per animal unit) and with the highest number of genotyped cocks  they were more than quadrupled (€69.80 per animal unit).  Genomic information of both sexes in relation to the return of the reference scenario (Ref) with different numbers of tested cocks and different sizes of calibration set. The genetic gain in the six traits of the crossbred hens in the practical environment is shown in Figure . While the genetic progress was substantially increased (partly doubled or tripled) for most traits  the genetic gain in egg weight was lower than in the reference scenario. In many breeding programs  however  egg weight is considered a trait under stabilizing selection (i.e. neither an increase nor a decrease of the trait level is desired)  so some reduction in genetic gain may be acceptable for this trait. This result for egg weight may also be a consequence of aiming at a higher laying performance with lower feed consumption  which has consequences on egg size.  LP1: laying performance 1  LP2: laying performance 2  LP3+4: laying performance 3 + 4  EW: egg weight  ESS: egg shell strength and M: mortality; genomic information of the cocks in relation to the reference scenario with different numbers of tested cocks and different sizes of calibration set. In general  this report demonstrates that the complete breeding structures of a conventional commercial crossbreeding program for laying hens can be comprehensively modelled with ZPLAN+. Although we simplified the breeding structures to some extent compared to what is implemented in a real breeding program  we still modelled 23 selection classes and 18 selection index variants in the different scenarios. ZPLAN+ allows for such a complexity by having  e.g.  no limit on the number of traits or information groups in the selection index module. However  the more complex a scenario becomes  the more challenging it is to define admissible parameters  e.g. positive definite variance-covariance matrices. In this case study  we showed that ZPLAN+ can handle breeding programs of different dimensions and complexity. Based on a conventional reference scenario  we evaluated different approaches to implement genomic information in the breeding strategies for laying hens. In scenario I  the genomic information was used as additional information. In scenario II  the selection in the purebred lines was based only on pedigree and genomic information  which allows the generation interval to be shortened substantially. Genomic information was shown to have a positive effect on monetary genetic gain in all scenarios. The size of the calibration set and the accuracy of the genomic information were found to have a large impact on the benefits from genomic selection. The theoretical background for this dependency was given by Dekkers[]  Daetwyler et al.[] and Erbe et al.[]  and practical calculations for other farm animals with ZPLAN or ZPLAN+ show the same trend[    ]. Over time  the number of animals available for recalibration will increase  which is expected to lead to a higher accuracy of genomic predictions  although the number of additional cocks with performance tested progeny will be small (60 per year and line). This study focused on the implementation and short-term effects of incorporating genomic information in a layer breeding program in the process transition from traditional to genomic breeding programs. Therefore  we did not model the dynamics of changing population sizes (in particular  training set sizes) over time. In scenario II  the advantage of genomic selection was particularly evident  because genomic information was the main basis for selection  such that the generation interval could be reduced substantially. In the reference scenario  selection of cocks and hens was carried out at one year of age  after the hens were performance tested. This led to a generation interval of 14.5 months. Since in scenario I  genomic information was only added as additional information  the generation interval was the same as in the reference scenario. In scenario II  the selection of cocks and hens relied only on genomic information and on the performance of the mother and of the full-sibs and half-sibs of the father. This made it possible to reduce the generation interval to the biological limit of about eight months  because the time of selection did not depend on performance information of contemporary hens. A reduction in generation interval is linked to an increase in the coefficient of inbreeding per year. However  several studies have reported that increase in inbreeding has only a small negative effect on the genetic gain of breeding goal traits in poultry e.g.[  ]. The effects of reducing generation interval were found in dairy cattle too  where the use of genomic information replaces progeny information  so that young bulls can be used immediately[  ]  which can reduce the variable costs per proven bull substantially. In conventional dairy cattle breeding programs  there are substantial costs related to housing and feeding the bulls for several years until the performance tests of their daughters are available. In addition  because a substantial proportion of the cow population is mated to test bulls with an inferior average breeding value compared to progeny tested bulls  this causes economic losses  which  together with the housing costs  add up to about €25 000 per tested bull. In layer breeding programs  the costs of keeping a cock are marginal and the performance information of the hens is necessary anyway for a recalibration of the GEBV. In addition  hens are used to produce the grandparental generation as well as the crossbred hens for performance testing. Thus  the benefit of scenario II in layers is mainly due to the reduced generation interval rather than to a significant reduction of breeding program costs  as may be the case for dairy cattle[]. In pigs  Henryon et al.[] showed that only a small proportion of the selection candidates preselected based on phenotype information need to be genotyped to realize most of the benefits. This approach cannot be used to reduce the generation interval in layers because in layers phenotype is measured after breeding age. However in scenario I  such an approach could reduce genotyping costs. The increase in genetic gain in the genomic scenarios was associated with a strong increase in costs  mainly for genotyping. The greater expected returns could offset these increased costs  but it has to be noted that the costs are real  while the benefits are theoretical predictions and will also only turn into a realized economic benefit if improved breeding products can be sold at a higher market price  or if the genetic superiority increases market share in a competitive market. The genotyping costs for the initial calibration study only had a marginal effect in the calculations because they were distributed across 127 640 animal units over a time frame of ten years. However  the costs of genotyping the calibration set (for 2000 animals the genotyping costs are 300 000 €) results in a considerable investment to be made in order to obtain an expected competitive advantage over a considerable period (ten years)  which may or may not materialize and generate an economic profit. If competing breeding companies also invest into a calibration study and establish a similar genomic selection scheme  then there will be no competitive advantage despite the fact that the investment was done. However  there would be a competitive disadvantage for the company if the investment had not been made. A reduction in genotyping costs of the genomic selection scheme could be achieved by the use of low-density chips containing a subset (e.g. 3 k to 6 k) of SNPs from the 60 k chip. This would reduce the costs of genotyping of selection candidates in each generation and nearly all the genomic information content could be retrieved by imputation strategies[  ] and only selected animals would need to be re-genotyped with the 60k chip. In dairy cattle  applying such an approach did not affect the quality of genomic information significantly[]. The expected genetic gain in individual traits from genomic selection differed substantially between traits. In particular  in the case of egg weight  the genetic gain was similar or even reduced compared to the reference scenario  while for the other five traits  genetic gains increased with the amount of genomic information (size of the calibration set and number of genotyped selection candidates). The reasons for this were the low economic weight of egg weight in all housing systems and the negative genetic correlations of egg weight with many other traits  especially laying performance. This was particularly evident in scenario II  in which performance testing information from the present generation was not used for selection. The relative benefits from genomic selection were high for traits with a low heritability such as mortality. Functional traits are especially expected to benefit from the use of genomic information[] but in our study  performance traits with a moderate heritability and higher economic weights in the breeding goal also benefitted from using genomic information. This was confirmed by Wolc et al.[]  who showed using real data that accuracy of the EBV increased when layers were selected on the basis of genomic information and no phenotypic information was available. Our study provides a basis to optimize layer breeding programs from an economic point of view. In particular  not having to wait for performance information of the hens could boost the genetic trend and increase the expected monetary genetic gain. In addition  a combination of genomic information and available performance information from the present generation  as in scenario I  could increase the monetary genetic gain compared to the conventional breeding program. For breeding companies  it is basically a business decision whether an investment in a genomic breeding program is expected to pay off through additional returns from a higher genetic quality of the marketable products  or an increase in the market share in a competitive market. On the one hand  market research has to assess the willingness of the direct customers to pay more for breeding stock of higher quality. Hen producers will make their final decision on the basis of whether egg producers are willing to pay a higher price for better laying hens. On the other hand  failing to adopt a major innovation in an oligopolic situation may lead to a major competitive disadvantage if the competitors implement the innovation and realize the benefits  combined with an appropriate communication strategy. In conclusion  genomic selection can substantially increase the efficiency of breeding programs for layers  as previously reported for other livestock species. Breeding structures and biological conditions in layers do not allow for a cost reduction but genomic information can be used either to increase the accuracy at selection (scenario I) or to shorten the generation interval (scenario II). The latter was shown to be the much more profitable strategy. However  the decision of whether or not to implement a major technological innovation such as genomic selection in a competitive market with an oligopolic structure does not only depend on expected genetic gains and profits but is primarily a business decision  taking into account the perceived consumers’ willingness to pay for improved genetics  as well as the assumed technological innovation strategy of the main competitors.

Genomic selection with imputation from very low- to high-density marker panels is a promising strategy for the implementation of genomic selection at acceptable costs. A panel size of 384 markers can be recommended for selection candidates of a pig breeding program if at least one parent is genotyped at high-density  but this appears to be the lower bound. Genomic selection refers to the use of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread across the genome for breeding value estimation and subsequent selection of individuals based on genomically enhanced breeding values [  ]. This technique has become a standard tool in dairy cattle breeding schemes  where it shortens the generation interval substantially []. The benefits for other livestock species like pigs or sheep are less obvious  mainly because generation intervals are already small and there is not so much scope for further reduction. However  Simianer [] and Lillehammer et al. [] showed that genomic selection can also be relevant in pig breeding schemes. With genomic selection  it is possible to exclude some selection candidates from progeny testing  and to increase selection intensities and the accuracy of the breeding values. Indeed some pig organisations have started to implement this technique. In Germany  for example  sire line pig breeding is dominated by Piétrain herdbook associations that apply sire progeny testing on stations for growth  carcass and meat quality traits. Some stations have started to implement genomic selection by genotyping these progeny tested sires with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip [] and to use them as the initial reference population []. From an economical point of view  the most critical point is the high cost of genotyping because individuals of the reference population and the selection candidates need to be genotyped. One way to reduce routine costs is to genotype selection candidates with an SNP panel of reduced density [–]. Missing genotypes can then be imputed using genotyping information from the individuals in the reference population and the genomic breeding values can be estimated for the selection candidates in the same way as if they were genotyped for the full set of SNPs. The accuracy of imputation depends on several factors  such as the number of SNPs in the low density panel  their informativeness and distribution across the genome  the relationship between the animals genotyped  the effective population size  and the method used. Livestock species usually have a low effective population size and a limited number of founder genome equivalents []; both characteristics are helpful in imputing missing genotypes. Various imputation methods are available  some of which are reviewed in []. In general  they can be classified based on whether they use linkage disequilibrium (LD)  e.g. fastPHASE [] and Beagle []  or pedigree information [  ]. Some methods use both types of information  e.g. LDMIP [] and AlphaImpute []. Many SNPs of the available chips have unknown chromosomal positions. For example  the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip contains<U+2009>><U+2009>62 000 SNP  of which 30% have no known position on the porcine genome sequence (build 7 version) []. In the current assembly of the pig genome (build 10.2)  which was used in this study  the proportion of SNPs with an unknown position was reduced. The SNP position is not crucial for genomic breeding value estimation  but it is needed if genotype imputation is performed. One obvious solution is to exclude SNPs with unknown positions but this may cause a substantial loss of genotypic information. Alternatively  the position could be estimated from the experimental data in a ‘classical’ way using linkage analysis. Since an approximated position might be sufficient for genotype imputation  the positions could also be approximated using LD information. The aim of the present study was to evaluate different strategies for genomic selection in a sire line pig population using low-density marker panels. The strategies included methods for the approximation of SNP positions  for the selection of SNPs to be included in the low-density panel  for genotype imputation  and for the estimation of the accuracy of genomic breeding values. The methods were validated using genotype imputation error rate  imputation accuracy  correlation between direct genomic values (DGV) and BLUP breeding values (EBV)  and approximate accuracies of DGV. Genotypes and EBV of 895 German Piétrain boars were available from breeding organizations. Boars were genotyped with the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip []. Sows were not genotyped. After removal of SNPs with a call rate less than 95%  with more than 2% parent progeny conflicts  a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 3%  or significant departure from HWE (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  48 062 markers remained and were used for the analysis. Markers with unknown physical positions were not removed but given an appropriate position  as described below. Alleles were coded as 0 and 1 such that allele 0 had the higher frequency. The three possible genotypes 0  1  and 2 were defined as the number of copies of allele 1. The boars were progeny tested with a varying number of offspring. Conventional EBV were available for 14 growth  carcass and meat quality traits from the routine animal evaluation centre (see Table ). The genotyped individuals were split into a training set and a validation set  as described below. Deregressed EBV were used as records for the estimation of direct genomic values (DGV) []. Two sets of EBV were calculated. For the first set  EBV were estimated using complete pedigrees. However  since the EBV of the individuals in the training and validation data sets were estimated in a single evaluation  not only the EBV but also the prediction errors of related individuals were correlated. This error correlation leads to an overestimation of accuracy if it is not accounted for []. This is a problem  especially if the accuracies of the EBV are low due to a limited number of offspring  which is the case in pig breeding. In order to examine the extent to which the error correlation led to an overestimation of accuracies  a second set of EBV was calculated. For the second set  the parents of the high-density genotyped boars were considered unknown  so the parental averages did not contribute to their EBV. This shortened pedigree was used to avoid correlations between prediction errors of the EBV of the genotyped boars. Traits and accuracies of the EBV are shown in Table . The validation set for both imputation and genomic selection consisted of 100 boars with genotyped sires but without genotyped offspring. The remaining 795 boars were included in the training set. Thus  the sire (but not the dam) of every individual from the validation set was in the training set. The individuals of the validation set were chosen from the latest delivered genotypes. In order to avoid a possible bias due to overfitting the model  we excluded these 100 boars (i.e. their EBV and their genotypes) from all evaluations done during the development of the imputation method. In order to also use markers with unknown physical position for imputation  their positions were approximated using LD information  as described below. Let  to be the vector of genotypes of the individuals for marker  and  the MAF of this marker. We constructed equivalence classes of marker sets such that markers from the same equivalence class are expected to belong to the same chromosome. Two markers ' and <U+2033> belong to the same equivalence class if a chain  ... <U+2009> of markers exists  starting with marker <U+2009>=<U+2009>' and ending with marker <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2033>  such that the absolute value of the correlation of the genotypes for adjacent markers in the chain is larger than a threshold value of 0.4. That is  with  for <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 ... <U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>1. The threshold value 0.4 was chosen to avoid equivalence classes to cover multiple chromosomes. Correlations of genotypes (coded 0 1 2) were used and not the LD measure []  because haplotypes are unknown for markers with unknown positions. If for a given equivalence class more than 95% of the markers with known physical positions belonged to the same chromosome  then all markers in this equivalence class were mapped to that chromosome  resulting in the assignment of markers with unknown positions to chromosomes. In order to enable imputation  the position of a marker  with unknown position on the identified chromosome was then set equal to the known position of a marker  from the same chromosome that maximized . Using this LD-based method  the position could be approximated for 3930 markers; positions of 153 markers remained unknown. Moreover  336 markers with position information based on build 10.2 were mapped to a different chromosome than originally assigned and these new positions were used in the present study. From the set of markers  four subsets consisting of 384  2 · 384 = 768  3 · 384 = 1152 and 3000 SNPs were selected based on equidistant location  high MAF  and low correlation of genotypes  as described in the following three steps. Let  be the location in megabases (Mb) and  the chromosome of SNP . In the first step  we defined a distance measure  between two SNPs  and <U+2033> as (' <U+2009><U+2033>)<U+2009>=<U+2009>8 if <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>  and if <U+2009>=<U+2009> then where   with <U+2009>=<U+2009>5. Following this  we have <U+2009><<U+2009>1 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) if the markers were separated by less than (more than) <U+2009>=<U+2009>5 Mb. Hence  for closely linked loci (<U+2009><<U+2009>1)  the correlation between the genotypes contributed to the distance measure. This was done so that two markers at similar genomic positions could be included in the low-density panel if they were not in LD and  hence  the correlation between their genotypes was low. In the next step  a score was calculated for each marker  based on its MAF (): where <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 if marker  had a known physical position in build 10.2 and if the position did not change during the editing of the marker map  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8 if the position of the marker was estimated as described in the previous section  i.e. the latter markers were penalised in the construction of the low-density panels. In the third step  markers were selected based on their scores and the distance measure . If  markers were already included in the low-density panel  then marker  was chosen such that  was maximized  i.e. it simultaneously had a high score and was at a large distance to all previously chosen markers. Roughly speaking  marker  was chosen from the largest gap  provided that a marker in the gap had a high score. For comparison  we also considered a naïve approach in which all markers had the same score (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)   was close to zero  and only markers with known physical positions were included. This resulted in low-density panels with approximately equally spaced markers since they were subsequently chosen from the centre of the largest gap. The high-density genotypes of all individuals in the training set were phased with Beagle version 3.3.2 by declaring individuals as unrelated or by including them as parent-offspring pairs. The algorithm is iterative and described in detail in [    ]. Following the phasing step  imputation from low- to high-density genotypes was done using a novel method that assumed that the sires of all low-density genotyped individuals were genotyped at high-density  as is probably the case in breeding schemes applying genomic selection with low-density panels. Imputation was done as follows. For each low-density genotyped individual  the imputation algorithm tried to determine whether the individual inherited the paternal or the maternal allele of the sire for all low-density markers. This is possible with certainty if the individual is homozygous at marker  and the sire is heterozygous. Let <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 if the individual inherited the paternal allele of the sire at marker   <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 if it inherited the maternal allele  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>-1 if the origin could not be determined. Thereafter  the origins of the remaining paternal alleles of the individual were estimated. Let  and  be low-density markers from the same chromosome for which the origin of the paternal allele could be determined and assume that the origin could not be determined for all low-density markers between  and . If the paternal alleles at markers  and  have the same origin ()  then it is assumed that all paternal alleles between  and  also have this origin ( for all <U+2009><<U+2009><U+2009><<U+2009>). If the alleles have a different origin ()  then it is assumed the cross-over occurred at the centre of the interval and paternal alleles between  and  were assigned the same origin as   and paternal alleles between  and  were assigned the same origin as . Thereafter  the paternal alleles of the individual for the high-density SNPs were imputed from their origin and the maternal alleles for the low-density markers were determined. The remaining maternal alleles were imputed using the haplotype library obtained from Beagle because it was assumed that the dams were not genotyped. Maternal alleles were determined as described below. For each low-density marker   the haplotypes of all high-density genotyped individuals were scored and the haplotype with the highest score was imputed over the largest range for which there was no allele conflict with the maternal haplotype  of the individual. Let  be the haplotype that is to be scored. The score of haplotype  at marker  is defined as where  is the number of low-density markers  for which exactly  low-density markers between  and  have different alleles at haplotypes  and . The definition of  is illustrated in Figure . Inclusion of summands for  was done to make the score more robust with respect to phasing errors. The parameter  is the additive genetic relationship between the mother of the individual to be imputed and the individual with haplotype   which was calculated from the pedigree. In particular  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 if the individual with haplotype  is the maternal grand sire and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25 if the individual with haplotype  is a maternal great grand sire. The results obtained with this imputation method were compared with the results obtained from Beagle.  Haplotype  is the maternal haplotype of the individual; haplotype  is one of the haplotypes from the haplotype library that is to be scored; for a specified value of  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  1  2  3  4)  the number  of markers for which there were exactly  haplotype conflicts in the interval between the respective marker allele and marker  was calculated; with respect to marker   the number of markers with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 conflict is ; for <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  2  3  4  the numbers of markers with  conflicts are       and   respectively. Direct genomic breeding values were estimated with GBLUP [] from the deregressed EBV. GBLUP was extended to account for heterogeneous error variances. Based on []  the error variance for individual  was proportional to   where  is the fraction of the additive variance not explained by markers and  is the reliability of the EBV of individual . We assumed <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.25. The imputation error rate and imputation accuracies were calculated for each marker panel and method. SNPs not included in the low-density panels were masked in the validation set and imputed using the training set. The imputation error rate was computed as the proportion of masked SNP genotypes that were not correctly imputed. The imputation accuracy for an individual was computed as the squared correlation between its true and imputed genotypes. To avoid that the coding of the markers affected the imputation accuracy  every marker was considered twice. The first time the alleles were coded as 0 and 1  and the second time  the numbers were interchanged. The individuals were divided into a training set and a validation set as described above. For individuals in the validation set  the correlation (  ) between DGV and EBV was estimated for each trait . The parameter of most interest  however  is the correlation between DGV and true breeding values (TBV)  which will be referred to as the accuracy of the DGV. Since the breeding values for individuals in the training set and the validation set were taken from the same genetic evaluation  there is a substantial correlation of prediction errors among individuals for the EBV that were computed using the complete pedigree. Thus  the frequently used formula to derive the accuracy of DGV  i.e. is expected to provide estimates that are substantially biased upwards []. Hence  another approach was needed and we used the following regression methodology. Suppose that for  randomly chosen traits  the correlation ( <U+2009>) has been estimated. These estimates have been obtained for different mean accuracies  and  of the EBV in the validation set and the training set  respectively. We predicted the expected correlation between EBV and DGV of a randomly chosen trait by assuming the following linear regression model where the intercept  and the regression coefficients  and  are fixed effects  and the errors  are normally distributed. Note that for   the EBV approximates the TBV  so the contribution of the prediction error to the correlation approaches zero. Thus  for   the expected correlation between EBV and DGV equals the expected accuracy of DGV for a randomly chosen trait with  specified. This was estimated as For simplicity we assumed that possible dependency of the error  on  is negligible. In this case  the accuracy of DGV for trait  can be estimated as Table  shows the imputation error rate and the imputation accuracies for the different marker panels and imputation methods. Error rates for SNPs with estimated physical locations were slightly larger than error rates for SNPs with known locations  but the error rates of both types of SNPs decreased as the size of the low-density panel increased. The error rate for SNPs with estimated positions was only 0.029 for the 3000 marker panel. Imputation with Beagle produced larger error rates than our imputation method  especially for very low-density panels. This shows that using information on relatives is important to achieve an acceptable error rate with very low-density marker panels. As expected  a low-density panel with equally spaced markers resulted in larger error rates than a panel in which markers with high MAF were favoured. Table  shows the influence of marker information from relatives on imputation error rate and imputation accuracy. For 73 individuals from the validation set  the sire (S) and the maternal grand sire (GS) were genotyped (column S<U+2009>+<U+2009>GS). For 27 individuals in the validation set  the GS was not genotyped (column S). The error rate was smaller if the grand sire was genotyped at high-density. The error rate for markers decreased from 0.149 to 0.129 for the 384 marker panel if GS was genotyped  and decreased from 0.027 to 0.022 for the 3 k panel. The decrease was relatively small because other high-density genotyped relatives also contribute to the accuracy. Figure  shows the imputation error rates for masked markers. Markers in the centre of the chromosomes could be imputed with the highest accuracy. Possible reasons are that the recombination rate is higher at the chromosome ends []  or that imputation works best if multiple low-density markers are present on both sides of an imputed marker. Since the error rate was higher at the chromosome ends  long chromosomes were imputed with higher accuracy than short chromosomes [see Additional file : Table S1].  For each chromosome  a spline is plotted to illustrate the trend in the imputation error rate along the chromosome; error rates for markers on different chromosomes are shown in different colours; markers on the X chromosome are on the right hand side; the positions of the markers from the low-density panel are indicated by black points on the x-axis. The labels show for every panel the number of markers and the mean error rate of markers with known position. Table  shows the correlations between DGV and EBV for different panel sizes and the effect of assuming parents of high-density genotyped individuals to be unknown in the calculation of EBV. The correlation between DGV and EBV was averaged over traits. The loss in accuracy due to imputation was smaller than expected from the imputation error rates when complete pedigrees were used. Both our imputation method and Beagle provided high correlations for the 3 k panel but our method was superior to Beagle for very low-density panels. The negligible increase in correlations when the panel size exceeds 768 markers shows that 768 markers are sufficient for imputation but 384 markers are suboptimal. Table  shows the correlations between DGV and EBV  and the estimated accuracies of the DGV. The correlation between DGV and EBV was considerably larger when complete pedigrees were used. This could have two reasons. First  when complete pedigrees were used to compute EBV  the DGV were estimated from more accurate EBV. Second  the prediction errors of the EBV from individuals in the validation set and the training set were correlated. Thus  the high correlation between DGV and EBV with use of complete pedigrees may arise from more accurately estimated prediction errors. The correlation of the prediction errors makes standard approaches for the estimation of accuracy of DGV (Equation ) unsuitable. Therefore  a regression approach was used to derive unbiased accuracies. The parameter estimates of equation () were      when complete pedigrees were used. The effect of the accuracy of the EBV in the validation set  was highly significant and negative. Thus  the smaller the accuracies of the EBV in the validation set are  the greater the overestimation of the accuracy of the DGV based on the correlation between DGV and EBV. Although the correlation between DGV and EBV was considerably smaller when the shortened pedigree was used  the estimated accuracies obtained with the regression approach were  on average  almost equal with complete and short pedigrees. Equation () provided slightly larger estimates than the regression approach  even if shortened pedigrees were used to calculate EBV. This could be because phenotypes of the validation progeny not only affect the EBV of their sires  but also the EBV of their maternal grandsires  which suggests that the correlation of prediction errors was not negligible for traits with EBV with very low accuracies (e.g.  pH1  IMF  Drip). Figure  visualizes the results of the regression approach. Each point in the scatter plot corresponds to one trait. The regression lines show how the correlation between DGV and EBV depends on the accuracies of the EBV in the validation set. The solid line shows the regression function  when the EBV were calculated using complete pedigrees  where  is the average accuracy of the EBV in the training set. The dotted line shows the regression function that was obtained when the parents of the sires genotyped at high-density were considered unknown in the calculation of EBV (i.e. the shortened pedigrees were used). To calculate the dotted line  the three outlier traits with EBV with the lowest accuracies in the validation set were omitted.  The regression lines show how the correlation between DGV and EBV depends on the accuracies of the EBV in the validation set; the solid line corresponds to the situation in which complete pedigrees were used for the calculation of EBV; for the dotted line  shortened pedigrees were used. The results presented in this paper showed that imputation caused only a small decrease in accuracy of the DGV  even for very low-density marker panels (384 SNPs across the genome). This might be due to the performance of the genotype imputation method proposed in this study. The method uses both LD and family information. It is tailored to a situation in which at least one parent of the selection candidates is genotyped at high-density. This might be a typical situation in livestock breeding schemes that apply genomic selection with low-density panels. Compared to imputation error rates reported in most other studies  the error rates obtained in this study (Tables  and ) were low. Weigel et al. [] reported an imputation error rate of 0.29 with IMPUTE2 [] for a low-density panel with 434 markers in Jersey cattle. In Hayes et al. []  imputation error rates were between 0.3 and 0.4 in various sheep breeds  using a 992 marker panel and applying fastPhase [] and were slightly higher when applying Beagle for imputation. Vereijken et al. [] obtained a mean accuracy of imputation of about 0.75 in chickens with a low-density panel containing 384 markers and applying Beagle. However  a comparison of error rates between studies is difficult because the relationships between individuals from the training set and the validation set differ between studies  the qualities of the marker maps may differ  and the effective population sizes are not equal. Huang et al. [] estimated imputation accuracies in a pig population. They obtained an imputation accuracy of 0.87 on chromosome 1 with a 384 marker panel  and an imputation accuracy of 0.97 with a 3 k panel if the sire and the grand sires were genotyped at high-density (scenario s5_25% in their paper). For comparison  we obtained imputation accuracies of 0.79 and 0.96  respectively  for the whole genome (Table ). Thus  Huang et al. [] obtained the same results for a 3 k panel  but slightly higher accuracies for a 384 marker panel. One reason could be that we considered the complete genome. Moreover  we used Beagle for phasing  whereas Huang et al. used AlphaImpute []  which can take pedigree information in consideration. Another reason is that we included markers with estimated positions. This explains a larger proportion of the additive variances with the high-density panel if markers with known positions are not equally spaced. However  when very low-density marker panels are used (384 markers)  then it may be better to exclude markers with uncertain positions from the marker panels in order to improve imputation accuracy and phasing for the remaining markers. For the imputation approach  all haplotypes of the haplotype library were scored for every low-density marker  and the haplotype  with the largest score was used to impute the maternal haplotype  of the individual in the neighbourhood of . The score of a haplotype  depends not only on the length of the interval in which  coincides perfectly with haplotype   but also on the mismatches at nearby SNPs. This increases the robustness of the method with respect to sporadic haplotyping errors that occur from data phasing. Moreover  inclusion of the additive relationship into the score has the effect of favouring haplotypes of closely related individuals for imputation. This is an advantage because for unrelated individuals the low-density haplotypes can by chance coincide in the neighbourhood of  Other methods such as Beagle []  LDMIP []  IMPUTE2 []  ChromoPhase []  or fastPHASE [] can be used for imputation. These programs were  however  not well suited for the structure of the data used in our study. Beagle does not use pedigree information to impute the maternal haplotype and fastPHASE and IMPUTE2 also generally exclude pedigree information for imputation. Methods LDMIP and ChromoPhase do use pedigree information. LDMIP involves alternate multilocus iterative peeling and imputation steps. However  in the typical situation in which dams have not been genotyped  the imputation step of LDMIP fails for low-density marker panels  since the imbedded requirement of 20 markers per chromosome with a known phase is not met. The ChromoPhase algorithm alternates between a rule-based allele assignment step and a step for the identification of shared segments. This is a promising strategy that outperformed fastPHASE for simulated data [] but as mentioned in []  the disadvantage of this algorithm could be its sensitivity to mapping and genotyping errors. Imputation error rates could be reduced by genotyping at high-density more close relatives of the low-density genotyped individuals (Table ). A further reduction could be obtained by determining the correct position of markers for which the locations had only been estimated because the error rates were higher for markers with estimated positions. Markers for the low-density panels were selected based on their scores and their distances to the markers already included in the low-density panel. The MAF of the marker was used as the score. An alternative procedure for marker selection that takes MAF and distances of adjacent markers into account was proposed by Wang et al. []. Our approach could easily be generalized to more complex situations. Take  to be the length of the chromosome that contains marker . The score may be multiplied with a factor of the form ((1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)<U+2009>+<U+2009> max ())/ in order to ensure that more markers from the low-density panel are placed on short chromosomes. In some cases  it may be desirable that the markers from the low-density panel explain part of the additive variance. The approach can be generalized to this situation. For example  the score of a marker may be defined as its average contribution to the additive variance of traits that are standardized to have the same additive variance. That is  the score could be  where  is the average squared estimated effect of marker   averaged over all traits. Another possibility is to let the score of a marker depend on the p-values obtained from an association study  such that markers with small p-values have a higher score. It is also possible to choose more markers from the chromosome ends by modifying the distance measure. The correlations between DGV and EBV (Table ) were substantially larger than expected for this small reference population and for the moderate reliabilities of the EBV [–]. One reason is that the effective number of chromosome segments is smaller for highly related individuals []  but this observation may not fully explain the high correlations that were observed. The regression approach showed that the correlation between DGV and EBV indeed provided a strongly upwards biased estimate of the accuracy of the DGV but that this bias could be corrected for. The bias occurred because EBV of individuals in the testing and the training sets had substantial prediction error correlations. Assuming the parents of the high-density genotyped individuals to be unknown in order to reduce this error correlation had little effect on the accuracies of the DGV but reduced the correlation between DGV and EBV substantially. The latter may be considered undesirable because a high correlation between DGV and EBV increases the acceptance of the genomic predictions by the breeders. However  the relevant parameter is the accuracy of the DGV. A practical consequence of the observed effect of the accuracy of the EBV in the validation set is that increasing the size of the training population does not necessarily increase the correlation between DGV and EBV if at the same time the reliabilities of the EBV in the validation set increase. Nevertheless  increasing the size of the training population is very important to obtain accurate DGV. The regression approach used a linear model to predict the regression function outside the range of the data. Since the linearity assumption might be violated  this approach should be evaluated in more detail with simulated data  where the true accuracies are known. The regression approach used results from multiple traits with heterogeneous accuracies of the EBV (Table ). This approach could be transferred to a situation in which only one trait is observed  provided that EBV of the individuals have heterogeneous accuracies. In this case  a replicate  could be obtained by splitting the data into a training set  a validation set and an omitted set. Care should be taken so that the mean accuracies of the EBV in the validation sets vary between replicates and that the mean accuracies in the training sets are approximately equal to the average accuracy of all EBV. For these replicates the linear model  could be fitted  i.e. parameter  could be omitted if only one trait is considered. Methods for genomic selection using low-density marker panels were introduced and applied to a dataset from a sire breeding line in pigs. It was shown that imputation from low- to high-density marker panels is a promising strategy  even if the low-density panel contains less than 1000 markers. A number of 768 markers can be recommended  but 384 markers may be sufficient if at least one parent is genotyped at high-density. Careful selection of low-density markers is essential. The proposed regression method for obtaining unbiased estimates of the accuracy of genomic breeding values in a cross-validation setting showed promising results but has to be evaluated in more detail.

In such cases  an individual’s phenotype is affected by the direct (genetic) effect of the individual itself and the indirect (genetic) effects of the group mates. Using data on individual phenotypes  direct and indirect genetic (co)variances can be estimated. Together  they compose the total genetic variance that determines a population’s potential to respond to selection. However  it can be difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes. Phenotypes on traits such as egg production and feed intake are  therefore  often collected on group level. In this study  we investigated whether direct  indirect and total genetic variances  and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data (pooled by group).

The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to the same family. Group housing is common practice in most livestock farming systems. Previous studies have shown that group-housed animals can substantially affect one another’s phenotype through social interactions [–]. The heritable effect of an individual on its own phenotype is known as the direct genetic effect  while the heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a group mate is known as the social  associative or indirect genetic effect [–]. Both direct and indirect genetic effects determine a population’s potential to respond to selection   the total genetic variance [  –]. Selection experiments in laying hens and quail [    ]  and variance component estimates in laying hens  quail  beef cattle and pigs [–] have shown that indirect genetic effects can contribute substantially to the total genetic variation in agricultural populations. Direct  indirect and total genetic variances can be estimated from individual data. However  it can be difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes on certain traits   egg production and feed intake. Alternatively  data can be obtained on group level  resulting in pooled records. However  pooling data reduces the number of data points. Moreover  multiple animals influence each data point  increasing the complexity of the data. Although there is an obvious loss of power  previous studies have shown that pooled data can be used to estimate direct genetic variances for traits not affected by social interactions [–]. However  with social interactions  indirect genetic effects emerge and the complexity of the data increases further. It is unclear whether pooled data are still informative in these situations. Therefore  the main objective of this study was to determine whether pooled data can be used to estimate direct  indirect and total genetic variances  and breeding values for traits affected by social interactions. In addition  optimal group composition was determined   the optimal number of families represented in a group to minimise the standard error of the estimates. This study was performed in three steps. First  all research questions were answered by theoretical derivations. Second  a simulation study was conducted to investigate the estimation of variance components and optimal group composition. Third  individual and pooled survival records on 12 944 purebred laying hens were analysed to investigate the estimation of breeding values and response to selection. Table  lists the main symbols and their meaning. In this section  we examined whether direct  indirect and total genetic variances  and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data. With social interactions  an individual phenotype consists of the direct genetic () and environmental () effects of the individual itself ()  and the indirect genetic () and environmental () effects of its group mates (): where  is the number of individuals per group []. From an animal breeding perspective  the total breeding value () is of interest because it determines total response to selection. An animal’s  consists of a direct and indirect component: where  is expressed in the phenotype of the animal itself and  is expressed in the phenotype of each group mate. A pooled record () consists of the individual phenotypes of all group members (): It follows from Equations () and () that  with social interactions  a pooled record consists of the  and  of each group member  as well as their  and  that are expressed  – 1 times: Because an animal’s  and  are expressed in the same pooled record  the direct -matrix that links pooled phenotypes to ’s and the indirect -matrix that links pooled phenotypes to ’s are completely confounded (as shown in Appendix A by using a fictive example (Table 8)). Consequently  direct and indirect (co)variances  and breeding values cannot be estimated from pooled data. It follows from Equations () and () that  with social interactions  a pooled record contains the total genetic effect of each group member: Equation () shows strong similarities with: which shows the content of a pooled record when social interactions do not occur. Previous studies have shown that pooled data can be used to estimate direct genetic variances () and direct breeding values for traits that are not affected by social interactions [–]. Similarly  pooled data can be used to estimate total genetic variances () and total breeding values for traits that are affected by social interactions. In this section  the standard error (s.e.) of  is derived for three experimental designs that differ with respect to group composition   group members belonged to either one  two or  families. The s.e. of an estimate of the genetic variance depends on the between-  and within-family variance   the relatedness within a family ()  the number of families ()  and the number of records per family () []: Analysis of variance was used to derive  and  for each design (see Appendix B for derivation). The s.e. of  differs between experimental designs because the group composition changes the within-family variance and the number of records per family (Table ). On the one hand  the within-family variance decreases when the number of families per group decreases  causing a strong decrease in s.e.. On the other hand  the number of records per family decreases when the number of families per group decreases  causing a slight increase in s.e.. Overall  to obtain the most accurate estimate of   group members should belong to the same family. The only exception is when family size () equals group size (). In this case  there is only one record per family and  would not be estimable. Ideally  group members should be full sibs rather than half sibs  since an increase in relatedness causes a decrease in the s.e. of . To validate the theoretical derivations  a simulation study was conducted in R v2.12.2 []. A base population of 500 sires and 500 dams was simulated. Each animal in the base population was assigned a direct and indirect breeding value  drawn from . The  and  were set to 1.00  and  was set to -0.50  0.00 or 0.50. Each sire was randomly mated to a single dam  resulting in 12 offspring per mating for a total of 6000 simulated offspring. For each offspring  direct and indirect breeding values were obtained as:  and   where the direct and indirect Mendelian sampling terms were drawn from . Each offspring was also assigned a direct and indirect environmental value  drawn from . The  and  were set to 2.00  and  was set to -1.00  0.00 or 1.00. Animals were placed in groups of four. Depending on the scenario  group members belonged to one  two or four families. Individual phenotypes were obtained by summing the direct and indirect genetic and environmental components according to Equation (). Pooled records were obtained by summing individual phenotypes according to Equation (). Seven scenarios were simulated  which differed in    or group composition (Table ). For each scenario  100 replicates were produced. Based on the previous section  expectations are that the use of a direct–indirect animal model for pooled data will fail to differentiate between direct and indirect genetic effects  while the use of a traditional animal model for pooled data will yield estimates of . To validate these theoretical predictions  both models were run. First  the simulated pooled records were analysed with the following direct–indirect animal model in ASReml v3.0 []: where  is a vector that contains pooled records ();  is a vector that contains the pooled mean;  is an incidence matrix linking the pooled records to ’s (each pooled record was linked to the ’s of the four group members);  is a vector that contains ’s;  is an incidence matrix linking the pooled records to ’s (each pooled record was linked to the ’s of the four group members);  is a vector that contains ’s; and  is a vector that contains residuals. Second  the simulated pooled records were analysed with the following traditional animal model in ASReml v3.0 []: where    and  are as explained above;  is an incidence matrix linking the pooled records to ’s (each pooled record was linked to the ’s of the four group members); and  is a vector that contains ’s. Based on the previous section  expectations are that the most accurate prediction of  will be obtained when group members belong to the same family. To validate this theoretical prediction  the predicted s.e. of  was compared to (i) the standard deviation (s.d.) of 100 estimates of  (’s reported by ASReml) and (ii) the mean of 100 s.e.’s of  (s.e.’s reported by ASReml) for three group compositions (scenarios 1  6 and 7 of Table ). The dataset was part of the pre-existing database of Hendrix Genetics (The Netherlands) and contained routinely collected data for breeding value estimation. Animal Care and Use Committee approval was therefore not required. To validate the theoretical derivations and to gain insight into response to selection  individual and pooled data on survival in purebred laying hens () were analysed. Survival in group-housed laying hens is a well-known example of a trait affected by social interactions  since a bird’s chance to survive depends on the feather pecking and cannibalistic behaviour of its group mates. Ellen et al. [] used individual survival data on three purebred lines to estimate direct and indirect genetic (co)variances. Large and statistically significant indirect genetic effects were found in two out of three purebred lines. In the current study  we used data from the same two lines. Data were provided by the “Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.”  the layer breeding division of Hendrix Genetics. Data on 13 192 White Leghorn layers were provided of which 6276 were of line W1 and 6916 were of line WB. At the age of 17 weeks  the hens were placed in two laying houses. The laying houses consisted of four or five double rows  and each row consisted of three levels. Interaction with neighbours on the back of the cage was possible  but interaction with neighbours on the side was prevented. Four hens of the same purebred line were randomly assigned to each cage. Hens were not beak-trimmed. Further details on housing conditions and management are in Ellen et al. []. The individual phenotype was defined as the number of days from the start of the laying period until either death or the end of the experiment  with a maximum of 398 days. The individual phenotypes were summed per cage to obtain pooled records. If one individual phenotype was missing  the entire cage was omitted from the analysis. The final dataset contained records on 6092 W1 and 6852 WB hens. To obtain the direct  indirect and total genetic parameters for survival time  the individual phenotypes were analysed with the following direct–indirect animal model in ASReml v3.0 []: where  is a vector that contains individual phenotypes;  is an incidence matrix linking the individual phenotypes to fixed effects;  is a vector that contains fixed effects  which included an interaction term for each laying house by row by level combination  an effect for the content of the back cage (full/empty) and a covariate for the average number of survival days in the back cage;  is an incidence matrix linking the individual phenotypes to ’s;  is a vector that contains ’s;  is an incidence matrix linking the individual phenotypes to ’s;  is a vector that contains ’s;  is an incidence matrix linking the individual phenotypes to random cage effects;  is a vector that contains random cage effects (to account for the non-genetic covariance among phenotypes of cage members []); and  is a vector that contains residuals. This model yields estimates of    and   from which  can be calculated. Similarly  it yields estimates of ’s and ’s  from which ’s can be calculated. To improve a trait  animals should be selected based on their   since  determines a population’s potential to respond to selection. Alternatively  a traditional animal model can be used to analyse individual or pooled data. A traditional animal model on individual data only yields estimates of  and ’s. A traditional model on pooled data is expected to yield estimates of  and ’s  but not of  and ’s. To validate this theoretical prediction  these traditional models were also run. First  the individual phenotypes were analysed with the following traditional (direct) animal model in ASReml v3.0 []: where              and  are as explained above. Second  the pooled records were analysed with the following traditional animal model in ASReml v3.0 []: where  is a vector that contains pooled records ();  is an incidence matrix linking the pooled records to fixed effects;  is a vector that contains fixed effects (the same fixed effects as mentioned above);  is an incidence matrix linking the pooled records to ’s (each pooled record was linked to the ’s of the four group members);  is a vector that contains ’s; and  is a vector that contains residuals. The estimated variance components and breeding values of all three models were compared. In addition  we calculated the loss in response to selection that would occur when applying a traditional model to individual or pooled data instead of a direct–indirect model to individual data. The direct–indirect model applied to individual data yielded estimates of  and ’s. Based on their   250 animals were selected and the corresponding response to selection was calculated. Similarly  for the two traditional animal models  250 animals were selected based on their  (obtained from individual data) and  (obtained from pooled data). Once the top 250 animals were selected  their  (obtained from individual data) was used to calculate the total response to selection. Then  the loss in total response to selection was calculated. The direct–indirect animal model on pooled records failed to converge  confirming that direct and indirect (co)variances cannot be estimated from pooled data. The traditional animal model on pooled records yielded estimates of  and . These estimates did not differ significantly from the true  and  (Table )  where (derived by []) and (analogous to []). Based on Equation ()  the s.e. of  was predicted for three scenarios that differed in group composition   group members belonged to one  two or four families. The theoretical s.e. of  was compared to (i) the s.d. of 100 estimates of  (’s reported by ASReml) and (ii) the mean of 100 s.e.’s of  (s.e.’s reported by ASReml) (Table ). The theoretical s.e. of  did not differ significantly from the values obtained by simulation. Moreover  as predicted  the most accurate estimate of  was obtained when group members belonged to the same family. In comparison  the s.e. of  was twice as large when group members belonged to different families. This indicates that group composition is crucial when aiming to obtain accurate estimates. Table  shows the estimated variance components for individual survival data analysed with a direct–indirect animal model  and the estimated variance components for individual and pooled survival data analysed with a traditional animal model. The direct–indirect animal model on individual data yielded estimates of    and . Based on these components   was calculated (according to Equation ()). The traditional animal model on individual data yielded estimates of . The traditional animal model on pooled data yielded estimates of  that closely resembled the estimates of  from individual data. The direct–indirect animal model on individual data also yielded estimates of  and . As derived by Bergsma et al. []   is an estimate of . As derived by Bijma []   is an estimate of . As shown in Equation ()   is an estimate of . Consequently  the  and  from the direct–indirect animal model on individual data should sum to the  from the traditional animal model on pooled data. More precisely: The expected   calculated based on the  and  from the direct–indirect animal model on individual data  and the  from the traditional animal model on pooled data closely resembled each other. Table  does not show heritability estimates. Where the classical heritability () is used to express  relative to the phenotypic variance ()   is used to express  relative to []. Comparing values of  obtained from individual and pooled data would be misleading because they are not expected to be similar. Unlike for a trait that is not affected by social interactions   cannot simply be divided by the number of group members to obtain . When group members are unrelated  and The non-proportional increase of  does not enable a meaningful comparison between values of  obtained from individual and pooled data. In conclusion  when group members are unrelated  a traditional animal model on individual data yields estimates of   while a traditional animal model on pooled data yields estimates of . Moreover  the estimated cage and error variances from a direct–indirect animal model on individual data sum to the pooled error variance from a traditional animal model on pooled data. This result could explain the ‘inconsistencies’ found by Biscarini et al. []  who assumed that a traditional animal model on individual and pooled data should yield the same genetic variance. Moreover  Biscarini et al. [] expected to find a pooled error variance that is four times larger than the individual error variance. For body weight at the age of 19 and 27 weeks  these expectations were met. For body weight at the age of 43 and 51 weeks  however  the genetic variance estimated from pooled data was smaller than expected  while the pooled error variance was larger than expected. Biscarini et al. [] mentions the emergence of competition effects as a possible cause. We indeed expect to find indirect genetic effects when the individual data on body weight at the age of 43 and 51 weeks were reanalysed with a direct–indirect animal model. Using Equations () and ()  the estimated variance components from individual data would resemble the estimated variance components from pooled data. The regression coefficients of ’s obtained from individual data on the ’s obtained from pooled data strongly deviated from one (0.363<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.006 for W1; 0.392<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.010 for WB). The regression coefficients of ’s obtained from individual data on the ’s obtained from pooled data were close to  and not significantly different from  one (1.004<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.003 for W1; 1.001<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.001 for WB). This indicates that the ’s obtained from pooled data are unbiased estimates of the ’s obtained from individual data. Table  shows Spearman correlation coefficients between ’s and ’s obtained from individual data and the ’s obtained from pooled data. The Spearman correlation coefficients between the ’s obtained from individual data and the ’s obtained from pooled data were close to  but significantly different from  one. This indicates only a minor loss in the accuracy of ’s when using pooled instead of individual data  which will be reflected in a minor loss in response to selection when using pooled instead of individual data. To gain more insight  we calculated the loss in response to selection that occurs when applying a traditional model to individual or pooled data instead of a direct–indirect model to individual data. When applying a traditional model to individual data  the loss in total response to selection was 46.9% for W1 (Figure A) and 54.9% for WB (Figure C). When applying a traditional model to pooled data  the loss in total response to selection was 3.3% for W1 (Figure B) and 0.3% for WB (Figure D). In conclusion  the loss in total response to selection will be large when using a traditional animal model on individual data  but will be small when using a traditional animal model on pooled data. However  this outcome may be specific to this dataset. Survival in purebred laying hens was recorded in cages with four unrelated birds. Both direct and indirect genetic effects strongly influenced the trait. Group size  group composition  and the relative impact of direct and indirect genetic effects might influence the loss in total response to selection. For example  for body weight at 19 and 27 weeks of age  indirect genetic effects are expected to be small. In that case  an animal’s  is mainly expressed in the phenotype of the animal itself. Consequently  we expect that more accurate estimated breeding values can be obtained when using individual instead of pooled data. Biscarini et al. [] found a correlation of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.75 between the estimated breeding values based on individual and pooled data  resulting in a large loss in response to selection when using pooled instead of individual data. Thus  using pooled data does not always seem to be a proper alternative and requires further research.  and  for data on W1 hens.  and  for data on WB hens. <U+2206>G represents the total response to selection when selecting animals based on their  obtained from individual data or  obtained from pooled data. <U+2206>G represents the total response to selection when selecting animals based on their  obtained from individual data. Using pooled data  the total genetic variance and breeding values can be estimated  but the underlying direct and indirect genetic (co)variances and breeding values cannot. The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to the same family. While quantifying the direct and indirect genetic effects is interesting from a biological perspective  obtaining the total genetic effect is most important from an animal breeding perspective. When it is too difficult or expensive to obtain individual data  pooled data can be used to improve traits. This section demonstrates why direct and indirect (co)variances can be estimated from individual data  but cannot be estimated from pooled data. Consider a situation where four base parents produce six offspring. Animals are kept in groups of two and individual phenotypes are recorded on all six offspring (Table ). When analysing individual data with a direct–indirect animal model  the -matrices would be:  and  are not identical  indicating that the direct and indirect genetic effects are estimated based on different information sources  enabling the model to distinguish between these two effects. When analysing pooled data with a direct–indirect animal model  the -matrices would be:  and  are identical  indicating that the direct and indirect genetic effects are estimated based on the same information source  causing complete confounding between direct and indirect genetic effects. The model will not be able to distinguish between these two effects. Components of variance are determined by analysis of variance  where the full variance  is partitioned into a between-  and within-family component (). In this section  the derivation of    and  are presented for three group compositions. When the group is composed of only one family  the   of a family is expressed  times in the same pooled record. Therefore  the record of interest is  /.  When the group is composed of two families  the   of a family is expressed /2 times in the same pooled record. Therefore  the record of interest is 2 /.  When the group composition is random  the   of a family is only expressed once per pooled record. Therefore  the record of interest is  .

In this study  residual feed intake (RFI) and residual body weight gain (RG)  and their linear combination into residual feed intake and body weight gain (RIG) were studied to estimate their genetic parameters and analyze the potential differences in feed intake between the top ranked birds based on the criteria for each trait.MethodsPhenotypic and genetic analyses were completed on 8340 growing tom turkeys that were measured for feed intake and body weight gain over a four-week period from 16 to 20 weeks of age.ResultsThe heritabilities of RG and RIG were 0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 and 0.23<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  respectively. Residual body weight gain had moderate genetic correlations with feed intake (-0.41) and body weight gain (0.43). All three linear combinations to form the RIG traits had genetic correlations ranging from -0.62 to -0.52 with feed intake  and slightly weaker  0.22 to 0.34  with body weight gain. Sorted into three equal groups (low  medium  high) based on RG  the most efficient group (high) gained 0.62 and 1.70 kg more (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight than that of the medium and low groups  yet the feed intake for the high group was less (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) than that of the medium group (19.52 vs. 19.75 kg). When separated into similar partitions  the high RIG group (most efficient) had both the lowest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) feed intake (18.86 vs. 19.57 and 20.41 kg) and the highest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight gain (7.41 vs. 7.03 and 6.43 kg) relative to the medium and low groups  respectively.ConclusionsThe difference in feed intake between the top ranked birds based on different residual feed efficiency traits may be small when looking at the average individual  however  when extrapolated to the production level  the lower feed intake values could lead to significant savings in feed costs over time."

The heritabilities of RG and RIG were 0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 and 0.23<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03  respectively. Residual body weight gain had moderate genetic correlations with feed intake (-0.41) and body weight gain (0.43). All three linear combinations to form the RIG traits had genetic correlations ranging from -0.62 to -0.52 with feed intake  and slightly weaker  0.22 to 0.34  with body weight gain. Sorted into three equal groups (low  medium  high) based on RG  the most efficient group (high) gained 0.62 and 1.70 kg more (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight than that of the medium and low groups  yet the feed intake for the high group was less (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) than that of the medium group (19.52 vs. 19.75 kg). When separated into similar partitions  the high RIG group (most efficient) had both the lowest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) feed intake (18.86 vs. 19.57 and 20.41 kg) and the highest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight gain (7.41 vs. 7.03 and 6.43 kg) relative to the medium and low groups  respectively. The difference in feed intake between the top ranked birds based on different residual feed efficiency traits may be small when looking at the average individual  however  when extrapolated to the production level  the lower feed intake values could lead to significant savings in feed costs over time. Feed efficiency is important to animal production because feed cost is a large component of the overall cost in all production settings. A number of measures have been used to define feed efficiency at the herd  flock or individual level and each measure has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most commonly used measures are feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake (RFI)[]. Feed conversion ratio is defined as the amount of feed consumed per unit of weight gain  and is a composite trait of start and end body weights and feed intake. Selection for FCR can lead to unexpected consequences because of the relationship between the two traits that make up FCR. When selection intensity increases  direct selection on FCR focuses selection primarily on the information in the numerator  regardless of the distributional properties of the components[]. An additional problem is that ratio traits  such as FCR  cannot accommodate differential economic weights between the two traits involved[]. Residual feed intake (RFI) was originally used in beef cattle by Koch et al.[] and in poultry by Luiting[]. Residual feed intake represents the amount of feed intake which is not accounted for by the expected requirements for production (e.g. milk and egg production or in this case body weight gain) and body weight maintenance[]. Some of the cited advantages of RFI are that it is heritable  moderately correlated with FCR and feed intake  and ideally  independent of production traits[  ]. Although RFI may be seen as a good indicator of feed efficiency  it does have its drawbacks  namely  slow growing animals eating a relatively small amount of feed may have a more favorable RFI value[]. Previously reported heritability estimates for FCR and RFI in the turkey were 0.22 and 0.24  respectively  with a genetic correlation of 0.80[]. Similar to RFI  residual body weight gain (RG) is defined as the difference between actual and predicted body weight gain based on the regression of body weight gain on metabolic mid-weight (MMW) and feed intake[]. Hence  RG represents the amount of body weight gain not accounted for by differences in feed intake and MMW. In general  RG is associated with faster growth rates while remaining independent of differences in feed intake. In contrast to RFI (where a negative value is beneficial)  a positive value for RG is favorable. Residual intake and body weight gain (RIG)  developed in beef cattle by Berry and Crowley[]  is a linear combination of RFI and RG. Because it is a linear combination  it is hypothesized that RIG offers the benefits of both components of feed efficiency. Currently  no genetic parameter estimates for RG or RIG for turkeys are reported in the literature. The aim of the current study was to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters for both RG and RIG in a commercial turkey breeding population. The industry source Hybrid Turkeys collected all data utilized in this analysis. Hybrid Turkeys has an animal welfare committee that ensures the welfare of the turkeys meets the appropriate standards of care. Toms from a male primary breeder turkey line (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8340) with data collected over a 10-year period with pedigree information (28 464 relatives of the birds with records) were used. Rearing until 15 weeks of age was under a standard commercial production environment and feeding regime  which involved group housing with shared feeders and drinkers. At 15 weeks of age  toms were placed in individual cages (0.60 m wide  0.85 m long and 0.82 m high) to acclimatize and they remained in the same cage throughout the feeding trial  from approximately 16 to 20 weeks of age. Body weight was measured at the start (16 weeks of age) and the end of the trial (20 weeks of age). Feed intake was recorded by weighing feeders at the beginning of the trial  weighing the feed added to each feeder and weighing the remaining feed at the end of the trial. During this period  toms were fed a standard commercial diet  as shown in Table . Feed was available  with access to feed from individual feeders within a cage and a shared water source between cages. Average daily gain () was calculated as: Daily feed intake () was calculated as: Feed conversion ratio () was calculated as: Metabolic mid-weight () was calculated as: To determine RFI  expected feed intake was calculated as a multiple regression with observed feed intake as the dependent variable (Model 1). To determine RG  expected body weight gain was calculated as a multiple regression with observed body weight gain as the dependent variable (Model 2). Model 1: Model 2: <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009> In Models 1 and 2   is feed intake over the test period   is the metabolic mid-weight   is body weight gain over the test period   is the intercept        and  are partial regression coefficients  and  is the residual. The fixed contemporary group effect () was used to account for the common environment effect that influenced birds hatched on the same date and managed in the same group. Regression coefficients from Models 1 and 2 were used to calculate RFI (Model 3) and RG (Model 4) respectively: Model 3: Model 4: Residual intake and body weight gain (RIG) was calculated as RG-RFI  after standardizing both RG and RFI to a variance of 1. Taking the negative of RFI puts both RFI and RG on a positive scale  allowing for their combination into the RIG value. Residual intake and body weight gain is a linear function of both RFI and RG  which are themselves  linear functions of their component traits: feed intake  body weight gain and starting body weight. Two other combinations of RFI and RG were assessed to analyze what may be closer to an optimized emphasis. Residual intake and body weight gain 2 (RIG2) was computed as 2RG-RFI  residual intake and body weight gain 3 (RIG3) as RG-2RFI. The 8340 toms were split evenly into three groups: high  medium and low  separately for RFI  RG and RIG. Means of the feed efficiency and performance traits from the three groups were tested with Tukey multiple comparisons tests using the GLM procedure in SAS. For the total feed intake analysis  the 8340 toms were separately ranked based on RFI  RG  RIG  RIG2 and RIG3. From these data  the top 5% and 1% of birds  as well as the bottom 5% for each trait were chosen and a phenotypic analysis of DFI  body weight gain  and ADG was performed. Means were calculated for the sorted data for DFI  body weight gain and average daily gain. The number of days to achieve a 5 kg gain in body weight was calculated as 5 kg divided by the ADG for each scenario. Total feed intake over the duration was calculated by multiplying the DFI by the number of days to achieve a body weight gain of 5 kg. Heritability for each trait together with phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated using ASREML 2.0[]. The model for all traits was: where  is RFI  RG  RIG  RIG2  RIG3  FCR  feed intake  MMW  or body weight gain.  was a fixed contemporary group effect to account for the common environment of group of birds hatched and managed together   represents the random additive genetic effect  and  the residual random effect. The random effects were assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0. Heritability estimates were calculated based on a single trait model. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated pair-wise using a bivariate model. Phenotypic means  standard deviations and heritabilities of each trait are in Table . The means for RFI  RG  RIG  RIG2 and RIG3 were equal to 0  since they represent residuals of a linear model. All traits had a moderate heritability between 0.13 and 0.30  with the exception of FCR  which had a heritability of 0.05. Phenotypic and genetic correlations are in Table . The phenotypic correlations between feed intake  MMW and body weight gain were positive  ranging from 0.41 to 0.73  while the genetic correlations ranged from 0.62 to 0.67. Feed conversion ratio was phenotypically negatively correlated with feed intake (-0.27) but had a positive genetic correlation (0.21). Feed conversion ratio was also negatively correlated with body weight gain  both phenotypically (-0.68) and genetically (-0.64). None of the residual feed efficiency traits (RG  RFI  RIG  RIG2  RIG3) were phenotypically correlated with MMW  as expected  however weak genetic correlations did exist (-0.28 to 0.09). Residual body weight gain was moderately correlated  phenotypically and genetically  with body weight gain (0.66 and 0.43)  FCR (-0.71 and -0.66)  strongly correlated with RIG (0.91 and 0.94)  and had a zero phenotypic and a moderate negative (-0.41) genetic correlation with feed intake. Residual feed intake showed a zero phenotypic correlation with weight gain  along with a weak negative genetic correlation (-0.07). Residual feed intake also had a weak positive genetic correlation with FCR (0.36)  along with a strong negative genetic correlation with RG (-0.76). Residual intake and body weight gain was phenotypically and genetically negatively correlated with feed intake (-0.31 and -0.57) and FCR (-0.59 and -0.93) but was positively correlated with body weight gain (0.42 and 0.29  respectively). For RIG2  phenotypic and genetic correlations of -0.20 and -0.52 were seen with feed intake  and of 0.52 and 0.34 with body weight gain. For RIG3  phenotypic correlations were -0.42 and 0.29 with feed intake and body weight gain  respectively. The 8340 turkey toms were separated into three equally sized groups based on their ranking for RFI  RG and RIG  as shown in Tables   and  respectively. The most efficient RFI group (low) had lower feed intake values (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) than the medium and high groups (18.16 vs. 19.51 and 21.16 kg) (Table ). However  the low RFI group also had the lowest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight gain (6.86 vs. 7.01 and 7.00 kg). Additionally  the low RFI group was superior to the medium and high groups (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for FCR  RG and all three RIG traits. There was no difference (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) between the three groups for 16 and 20-week body weights or MMW. The results of the RG toms separated into groups are in Table . The high RG group (most efficient) gained 0.62 and 1.70 kg more (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight than the medium and low groups. The feed intake was lower (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) for the high group than for the medium group (19.52 vs. 19.75 kg) but was similar (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) to the low group (19.56 kg). Sixteen-week body weight was lowest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in the high group compared to the medium and low groups (13.10 vs. 13.67 vs. 14.09 kg). The high RG group was also significantly better (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for FCR  RFI and all three RIG traits. However  there was no difference (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) for MMW. As shown in Table   the high RIG group (most efficient) had both the lowest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) feed intake (18.86 vs. 19.57 vs. 20.41 kg) and highest (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) body weight gain (7.41 vs. 7.03 vs. 6.43 kg). Once again  16-week body weight was lower (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) in the high group vs. the other two RIG groups. The high RIG group also ranked best (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for FCR  RG  RFI  RIG2 and RIG3  while MMW showed no significant difference (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05) between the RIG groups. Results of the phenotypic analysis of differences in feed efficiency between birds grouped based on their rank for RFI  RG  FCR  and the three RIG traits are in Table . Daily feed intake of the top 1% and 5% of birds was lowest when birds were ranked on RFI (0.51 and 0.60 kg)  followed by RIG3 (0.55 and 0.63 kg)  and was highest in the RG group (0.60 and 0.67 kg). Average daily gain was lowest at both 1% and 5% levels when ranked on RFI (0.24 kg) and highest at the 1% level when birds were ranked on RG and FCR (0.30 kg). The time required to achieve a 5 kg body weight gain for the top 1% and 5% birds was shortest (17 days) for RG  RIG2 and FCR. The feed intake to achieve a 5 kg body weight gain was lowest for the top 1% and 5% birds when ranked on FCR (9.73 and 11.04 kg). Between the residual feed efficiency traits  the top birds ranked based on RIG2 had the lowest feed intake to achieve a 5 kg body weight gain  i.e. 9.95 kg at the 1% level and 11.39 kg at the 5% level. The top birds ranked based on RFI  RG and RIG required 10.87  10.03 and 10.07 kg  respectively  to achieve a 5 kg body weight gain at the 1% level  and 12.52  11.48 and 11.49 kg at the 5% level. Estimated heritabilities for starting body weight were comparable to previous estimates in turkeys[  ]. Similarly  estimated heritabilities for RFI  feed intake and body weight gain were also close to prior estimates in turkeys and comparable to results reported for broilers[    ]. However  the heritability of RFI was lower than estimated by Aggrey et al.[] and that of FCR (0.05) was also notably lower than previous estimates in turkeys[]. These lower heritabilities may be due to the inclusion of all data points in this study  thereby increasing the phenotypic variance for each trait. As expected  heritabilities of all three RIG traits were similar to those estimated for the component traits (RFI and RG)  since they are linear combinations of the latter. This similarity in heritabilities between RFI  RG and RIG was also previously reported in beef cattle[  ]. The negative genetic correlation between FCR and body weight gain (-0.64) has also been observed for other meat-type poultry[      ] and is most likely due to the inverse relationship between FCR and its component trait  i.e. body weight gain. The phenotypic and genetic correlations between FCR and RFI were lower (0.15 and 0.36) than previous estimates in turkeys and broilers[    ]  which is again likely due to the phenotypic variability found in FCR for the data (standard deviation of 0.96). The phenotypic correlations of zero between MMW and the residual feed efficiency traits (RFI  RG  RIG  RIG2  RIG3) were due to the inclusion of MMW in the regression model used to calculate each of these traits. For the same reason  RFI had a zero phenotypic correlation with feed intake and RG a zero correlation with body weight gain. Due to confounding factors of the RIG traits (RIG  RIG2  and RIG3) being linear combinations of RFI and RG  the phenotypic and genetic correlations of RIG were strong with both RFI and RG  and were not estimable for RIG2 and RIG3 with RFI and RG. Potential reasons for choosing RG as a selection tool are the contrasted results observed in the phenotypic and genetic correlations between RFI and other traits of interest. If selection decisions were made purely on the basis of RFI  it is possible that slow growing birds with low feed intake rank high. The favorable genetic correlations of RG with both feed intake and body weight gain (-0.41 and 0.43)  would lead selection on RG to produce faster growing birds with lower feed intake. The combination of RFI and RG into different traits (RIG  RIG2  RIG3)  depending on the emphasis placed on RFI versus RG  captures the benefits of both composite traits. In contrast to RFI and RG  the RIG traits were phenotypically and genetically correlated with both feed intake and body weight gain (Table ). The different weights on RFI and RG in the three RIG traits led to different phenotypic and genetic correlations with feed intake  with RIG2 having the weakest correlations and RIG3 the strongest correlations  with the opposite being true for correlations with body weight gain. The use of RFI in animal breeding programs is becoming more and more prevalent across species. However  it may be more advantageous in some species than others. Comparing results from Table  with similarly grouped RFI animal studies in beef cattle shows a marked difference. In a study by Montanholi et al.[]  the most efficient beef bulls ranked based on RFI (low) had significantly lower DFI than the medium and high groups. This was also the case for Irish performance tested beef bulls  for which again the most efficient bulls ranked based on RFI had significantly lower DFI than the medium and high groups[]. However  in both studies  ADG of the low RFI bulls was higher or equal than the ADG of the medium and high RFI groups. In our study on turkey  the low RFI group had significantly lower feed intake than the medium and high groups  but also had significantly lower body weight gain. This could make the use of RFI less beneficial in the turkey compared to beef cattle. When birds were divided into groups based on RG  with the high group being the most efficient  the high group had the greatest body weight gain over the test period and a slightly lower feed intake than the medium group (Table ). The partitioning of birds into groups based on RIG led the most efficient group (high) to have both significantly lower feed intake and significantly higher body weight gain than the medium and low groups (Table ). This demonstrates the benefit of combining RFI and RG into a single trait. The most efficient birds based on RFI ate less but had poor body weight gain  the superior birds based on RG had the best body weight gain but poorer feed intake  and the high birds based on RIG had both excellent body weight gain and feed intake. Interestingly  when looking at the most efficient groups based on each trait  average FCR was highest for the RFI group (2.78)  followed by RIG (2.57)  while RG and RIG2 had the same average FCR (2.54). As shown in Table   RIG2 was the closest to the ideal combination of low DFI and high ADG. While RIG2 offered the best result in this study  the weights placed on RFI and RG were not optimized; optimizing the weight could reduce feed intake to reach a 5 kg body weight gain even more. In addition  our results were based on a four-week period in the life cycle of the turkey (16–20 weeks). Thus  if the effects obtained during this period apply to the entire lifespan of the birds  cost savings due to lower consumption may be greater. Unlike RFI  RIG traits have moderate correlations (phenotypic and genetic) with body weight gain  yielding greater ADG and faster growth rates. While this can lead to improvements in feed efficiency  over-emphasizing body weight gain in a selection index may have detrimental consequences because it can have a negative impact on conformation traits such as hip and leg structure  as well as on footpad and breast skin health. Poor conformation traits can also lead to poor walking ability and other undesirable consequences[]. Investigating the genetic and statistical parameters for traits such as RFI  RG  RIG  RIG2 and RIG3 contributes valuable knowledge to the poultry industry. However  we must also consider previous research on linearly regressed traits in animal breeding. Koch et al.[] preferred the use of RG over RFI  both Herd et al.[] and Arthur and Herd[] used RFI  and Berry et al.[] denoted the advantages of RIG. Each trait has advantages and disadvantages but all are composite traits calculated using linear regressions on the component production traits. As such  the genetic and phenotypic properties of these efficiency traits can be predicted from the genetic and phenotypic parameters of their component traits[  ]. Adding any of the linearly regressed traits to a multiple trait selection index may prove useful but similar results may be achieved by applying the appropriate weights to their component traits (feed intake  body weight gain  metabolic mid-weight)[]. This study is the first to consider residual body weight gain and residual intake and body weight gain for poultry. Residual body weight gain was found to be moderately heritable and to have favorable phenotypic and genetic correlations with feed intake  body weight gain and FCR. Residual intake and body weight gain traits (RIG  RIG2  RIG3) were also shown to be moderately heritable  while having favorable genetic and phenotypic correlations with feed intake  body weight gain and FCR. Despite moderate to strong genetic correlations between all feed efficiency traits  none were equal to 1  indicating that  although small in some cases  there are genetic differences between these traits. Due to the strong correlations between the efficiency traits  selection on one of the feed efficiency traits will inevitably improve the others. Both RG and RIG traits have characteristics that make them appealing for inclusion in a multiple trait selection index but similar results could be attained by applying appropriate emphasis on their component traits in a selection index. Nevertheless  individual feed efficiency traits are important and perhaps the best use for RG and the three different combinations of RIG would be as benchmark traits  to compare individuals between or within flocks  and as tools to follow trends over time. Further studies on the genetic correlations between RG  RIG traits and other important traits  such as  breast meat yield  livability and walking ability are warranted.

"Genes of the RNASE5 pathway contain SNP associated with milk production traits in dairy cattle"	"Authors: Lesley-Ann Raven  Benjamin G Cocks  Jennie E Pryce  Jeremy J Cottrell and Ben J Hayes"	"Biosciences Research Division  Department of Primary Industries Victoria  5 Ring Rd  Bundoora  3086  AustraliaLesley-Ann Raven  Benjamin G Cocks  Jennie E Pryce  Jeremy J Cottrell & Ben J Hayes La Trobe University  Bundoora  VIC  3086  AustraliaLesley-Ann Raven  Benjamin G Cocks & Ben J Hayes Dairy Futures Co-operative Research Centre  Bundoora  VIC  3086  AustraliaLesley-Ann Raven  Benjamin G Cocks  Jennie E Pryce & Ben J Hayes"	"No Co-Author"	"16 July 2013"	"BackgroundIdentification of the processes and mutations responsible for the large genetic variation in milk production among dairy cattle has proved challenging. One approach is to identify a biological process potentially involved in milk production and to determine the genetic influence of all the genes included in the process or pathway. Angiogenin encoded by  () is relatively abundant in milk  and has been shown to regulate protein synthesis and act as a growth factor in epithelial cells  However  little is known about the role of angiogenin in the mammary gland or if the polymorphisms present in the bovine  gene are associated with lactation and milk production traits in dairy cattle. Given the high economic value of increased protein in milk  we have tested the hypothesis that  or genes in the RNASE5 pathway are associated with milk production traits. First  we constructed a “RNASE5 pathway” based on upstream and downstream interacting genes reported in the literature. We then tested SNP in close proximity to the genes of this pathway for association with milk production traits in a large dairy cattle dataset.ResultsThe constructed RNASE5 pathway consisted of 11 genes. Association analysis between SNP in 1 Mb regions surrounding these genes and milk production traits revealed that more SNP than expected by chance were associated with milk protein percent (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 significance).

One approach is to identify a biological process potentially involved in milk production and to determine the genetic influence of all the genes included in the process or pathway. Angiogenin encoded by  () is relatively abundant in milk  and has been shown to regulate protein synthesis and act as a growth factor in epithelial cells  However  little is known about the role of angiogenin in the mammary gland or if the polymorphisms present in the bovine  gene are associated with lactation and milk production traits in dairy cattle. Given the high economic value of increased protein in milk  we have tested the hypothesis that  or genes in the RNASE5 pathway are associated with milk production traits. First  we constructed a “RNASE5 pathway” based on upstream and downstream interacting genes reported in the literature. We then tested SNP in close proximity to the genes of this pathway for association with milk production traits in a large dairy cattle dataset. The constructed RNASE5 pathway consisted of 11 genes. Association analysis between SNP in 1 Mb regions surrounding these genes and milk production traits revealed that more SNP than expected by chance were associated with milk protein percent (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 significance). There was no significant association with other traits such as milk fat content or fertility. These results support a role for the RNASE5 pathway in milk production  specifically milk protein percent  and indicate that polymorphisms in or near these genes explain a proportion of the variation for this trait. This method provides a novel way of understanding the underlying biology of lactation with implications for milk production and can be applied to any pathway or gene set to test whether they are responsible for the variation of complex traits. Bovine milk is a valuable and widely consumed source of high-value protein and fat. The cytological mechanism of milk synthesis and secretion in cattle is well-described[]  however  the molecular mechanisms responsible for variations in the components of milk require further investigation given the importance of these processes for human nutrition. In dairy cattle  the heritability of milk protein yield has been estimated to be approximately 23%[]. If the polymorphisms contributing to milk traits were identified  this information could be used in breeding programs to increase milk protein yields. Furthermore  identification of the gene pathways involved will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate lactation and to the development of new approaches to improve milk production and the value of milk proteins for human nutrition. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a popular methodology to identify genomic regions containing variants affecting complex traits. In dairy cattle  GWAS have identified several regions of the genome associated with variation in milk protein content[–]. This method requires stringent thresholds to avoid high rates of false positives caused by multiple testing. As a result  it does not perform well for traits that involve many genes of small effect and cannot identify relationships between genes adequately. An alternative approach is to use prior biological knowledge to select gene pathways that are likely to be involved in milk production  and thus to limit association analyses to SNP that are within or in close proximity of the genes in these pathways. While this approach reduces the number of polymorphisms that can be identified  it has the advantage of using lower significance thresholds since the whole genome is not tested and multiple testing is greatly reduced  leading to more power to detect associations of smaller effect[]. This approach can also be used to test whether a particular gene pathway is associated with a quantitative trait such as protein yield in milk. Genetic variations in milk protein genes including the four caseins and the major whey proteins ß-lactoglobulin and a-lactalbumin have been studied in detail  with documented polymorphisms affecting fat and protein concentrations[]. However  these polymorphisms only account for a fraction of the genetic variation of traits like protein yield. Minor milk proteins may also be important regulators of these traits since they can have a functional role in milk or the mammary gland. One interesting candidate gene for the regulation of lactation is the gene  (). The protein RNASE5 is a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily  i.e. proteins known for their potent action as RNA cleaving enzymes. However  RNASE5 is an ancestral member of the RNase A family that has unique and distinct functions from other members of this family[]. RNASE5 is well known for its role in blood vessel formation and has been linked to cancer pathogenesis[  ]. It is also involved in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis  protein synthesis in prostate epithelial cells and has a growth factor function in epithelial and endothelial cell types[  ]. While expressed in many different tissue types  secretory epithelial cells appear to be the primary location for RNASE5 synthesis[]. RNASE5 has been detected in bovine milk at a concentration ranging from 4 to 19 µg/mL  but its role in milk remains unclear[  ] and may include an antimicrobial function[  ]. In the bovine genome  the gene  is duplicated but no functional role explains this duplication[]. The presence of RNASE5 in milk and hence mammary tissue and the fact that it has a regulatory role in protein synthesis in epithelial cells suggest that it could have a function during lactation. Knowledge on the mechanism of RNASE5 synthesis and action may contribute to identify a source of genetic variation associated with milk production traits and establish a regulatory role for RNASE5 in the mammary gland. Variation in the expression of  could result not only from polymorphism in the gene itself  or its cis-acting regulatory elements  but also from upstream regulators or downstream mechanisms. The mechanism of action of the RNASE5 protein involves several key processes. RNASE5 binds to the endothelial cell surface via a 42 kDa a-actin and this complex activates cell-associated protease and subsequent degradation of the basement membrane[]. RNASE5 also binds to a 170 kDa cell surface receptor  a complex that sets off signal transduction cascades  and undergoes translocation to the nucleus via endocytosis[] where it enhances rRNA transcription[] and rRNA processing[]. The ribonucleolytic activity of RNASE5 is required for its biological function[]. RNASE5 exhibits cell density-dependence and cell surface receptor activity  which suggests that it acts in a paracrine way[]. There is also evidence that RNASE5 is expressed in mammary epithelial cells[]. This study explores the role of the RNASE5 pathway in milk production traits. We hypothesised that RNASE5 may be associated with different aspects of lactation in the mammary gland  and therefore that the  gene and the genes involved in the RNASE5 pathway could contain polymorphisms affecting milk and protein production in dairy cattle. To test this hypothesis  first we reviewed the literature for genes involved in the RNASE5 pathway  including direct upstream and downstream regulators. Next  we used a linear regression model to test the association between a set of SNP located 500 kb on either side of each of the genes in the RNASE5 pathway and milk production traits (at a P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 experiment-wise threshold). In this study  an association analysis between SNP in the genes of the RNASE5 pathway and several milk production and reproductive traits in dairy cattle was performed. Current research aimed at investigating the role of RNASE5 in epithelial cells and in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer has provided insights into its cellular role. Based on these studies  we identified proteins known to regulate or interact with RNASE5 and constructed a pathway gene set. This isolated subset of identified genes was hypothesised to be collectively specific to the cellular role of RNASE5. We limited the gene pathway to genes for which the proteins showed evidence of a direct binding interaction with RNASE5  a clear role in the already-characterised mechanism of action of RNASE5 or those that were significantly up-regulated by RNASE5. We excluded genes such as  involved in broad-acting cellular processes e.g. cell signalling and growth factors. While these proteins are functionally important  we wanted to avoid any interference from similar molecular pathways and processes  which may be involved in milk and protein production independently of the RNASE5 pathway. The genomic location of the genes in the RNASE5 pathway was determined using the Bovine Genome Build 4.0 in the NCBI database[]. To identify the bovine ortholog of the human  gene ()  one of the genes in the pathway  we conducted a sequence comparison using the basic alignment search tool (BLAST) version 2.2.25 in the NCBI database[]. We identified the start and stop positions of each gene and expanded the region located 500kb on either side of the gene to reflect the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Holstein cattle[]  and to ensure that there was a sufficient number of SNP in the windows analysed (on the Bovine SNP50 BeadChip[]) and thus that there was a reasonable chance that at least one SNP would be in moderate to high LD with a causal mutation  given the highly variable nature of pair-wise LD. These collective SNP provided the pathway gene SNP set for analysis. After quality control performed according to[]  the total 50k SNP chip data set consisted of 43 115 SNP. Of these  211 SNP were within our gene windows (see results for more detail). Two thousand one hundred and fifty-four Holstein-Friesian bulls were genotyped for the 50k chip and at each SNP  genotypes were 0  1 or 2  based on the number of copies of the first allele (first alphabetically in top format). The phenotypes for the bulls were the daughter trait deviations (essentially the average of the bulls’ daughters records for these traits  corrected for fixed effects such as herd  year and season) for milk yield  fat yield  fat percent  protein yield  protein percent and fertility  as previously described[  ]. To account for population structure  a relationship matrix derived from a pedigree dating back to the 1940’s was fitted in the model  as described below. An association analysis was used to determine the relationship between SNP polymorphisms within the RNASE5 pathway and milk production and reproductive traits. Statistical analyses were performed using ASReml[]. The linear mixed model used for the SNP analysis  for each SNP in turn  was where  is a (number of bulls<U+2009>×<U+2009>1) vector of daughter trait deviations   is a vector of 1s  µ is the overall mean   is the vector of bull genotypes (0 1 or 2)  ß is the effect of the second allele of the SNP   is a design matrix allocating daughter trait deviations to bulls   is a vector of polygenic effects and  is the vector of random residuals. The polygenic breeding values were fitted as random effects following a normal distribution where  is the expected relationship among individuals constructed from the pedigree and is the polygenic genetic variance. Significant SNP were selected at a p-value threshold of P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. The proportion of significant SNP in the pathway was then the number of significant SNP divided by the number of SNP tested. To determine an appropriate experiment-wise significance threshold  a random permutation method was used. This approach used only SNP in gene regions. A list of 23 022 uniquely annotated bovine genes were selected from the Ensembl-Biomart database[]. Then  we chose 11 genes (the same number as in our pathway) at random and the genomic regions spanning 500 kb on either side of these genes were used to construct the SNP sets for analysis. This procedure was replicated 10 000 times. The SNP were analysed in ASReml[] using the mixed linear model described above and the resulting null distribution was expressed as the proportion of significant SNP. This method controls for potential bias in the proportion of significant SNP by testing SNP in gene regions versus intergenic regions. The ratios of significant SNP from the permutations were compared to the observed distribution to determine experiment-wise significance for each trait. We calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) at P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 with the observed data  and the permutated data as[] where   is the number of tests  P is the probability value of the F-test for the linear regression and S is the proportion of significant SNP at P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. We also analysed the correlations between significant SNP for each trait to determine the extent of pleiotropy. This study considered genomic regions spanning 500 kb on either side of each gene in the RNASE5 pathway. These genomic regions were chosen to reflect the extent of linkage disequilibrium in Holstein-Friesian cattle; however  other genes that lie within these regions may produce conflicting results. For example  a gene harbouring a mutation with a well characterised effect on fat percentage   () was within the window for   a gene in the RNASE5 pathway[]. To control the effect of this gene in our analysis  we repeated the association study and permutations with phenotypes corrected for the effect of  (in fact  the SNP most highly associated with the polymorphism in this gene). Each animal was assigned a new phenotype for which the effect of the  SNP from the experimental GWAS was subtracted as a multiple of the number of common alleles present. We identified a pathway that includes the genes known to specifically interact with RNASE5 i.e. genes coding for proteins that interacted with RNASE5  that had a clear role in the already characterised mechanism of action of RNASE5 or those up-regulated  by RNASE5. We avoided cell signalling and growth genes which have broad functions within the cell to avoid overlap with irrelevant cell functions. RNASE5 appears to act as a highly regulated switch. Studies have identified synthetic and non-synthetic RNASE5 binding proteins in an attempt to regulate angiogenesis as a cancer treatment. However  many of these proteins are not naturally occurring or are unlikely to function during normal RNASE5-mediated processes such as angiogenesis  so the corresponding coding genes were not included in the analysis. Information was taken from a large number of publications describing the primary actions of RNASE5 as well as interactions with other proteins (e.g.[] and references therein). We identified over 100 proteins among which 11 met our criteria for analysis (Figure ; Table ). The genes   and its homologue   were the first obvious candidates. RNASE5 increases protein synthesis in murine epithelial cells and shows differential expression in lactating mammary gland[    ] (e.g. accession numbers: E-GEOD-5258  E-GEOD-29119  E-MTAB-37  E-MTAB-62  E-GEOD-20081  E-TABM-420  E-GEOD-3952  E-TABM-683  E-TABM-683  E-GEOD-20081  E-GEOD-3526  E-MTAB-62  E-GEOD-7307). These genes are transcribed from the same promoters and are functionally homologous[  ].  also shows homology to the  gene (83.6% DNA identity) and  (75.8% DNA identity). Since  these genes lie in close proximity to   only the  gene region was considered in order to avoid multiple testing. The  promoter contains two binding sites for the stress response gene  ()[]. In an oxygen deprived environment  HIF1A increases the extracellular concentration of RNASE5  binds growth factors and enhances  mRNA expression[  ]. Three cell surface receptor genes were identified:  ()   () and  (). ACTA2 is a well-known RNASE5-binding protein involved in cell proliferation  migration and invasion[  ]. The plectin-2B receptor is known to function as the RNASE5 cell receptor (GF Hu  personal communication). RNASE5 also interacts with several stimulatory proteins i.e. fibulin (FBLN1)  follistatin (FST) and follistatin-like protein 3 (FSLP-3). RNASE5 directly binds to fibulin [] and contains follistatin binding domains[]. Follistatin-like-3 is functionally and structurally homologous to follistatin but has not been shown to interact directly with RNASE5[]. However  because of its homology to follistatin and its characteristic nuclear localisation  it is a candidate gene for the RNASE5 pathway[]. Three other genes were identified from a previous analysis on  in murine epithelial cells. Microarray data indicate that  () is strongly down-regulated by  in mouse mesodermal cells[  ] (M McDonagh  personal communication). In mouse  it has been shown that  is involved in the maturation and post-transcriptional modifications of tRNA  mRNA and rRNA but the bovine ortholog has not been isolated. BLAST analysis[] showed that the human  gene shared 89% similarity with the bovine  gene ()  which was thus included in the RNASE5 pathway to represent . Ribosomal protein L22-like 1 (RPL22L1) functions as a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit and is localized to the nucleus via binding interactions with rRNA[]. Both   and  (sp140 nuclear body protein) genes were significantly up-regulated in a microarray analysis of murine epithelial cells treated with RNASE5[  ] (M McDonagh  personal communication). These genes are also differentially expressed in murine and human mammary gland (accession numbers: E-GEOD-3526  E-GEOD-20081  E-MTAB-62  E-MTAB-37  E-AFMX-4[]).   The proposed mechanism of action as determined from a review of the literature. Hypoxic stress triggers transcription of [].  triggers the expression of two cell-density dependent receptors. At higher cell densities   binds with the endothelial cell surface via a 42-kDa a-actin receptor which stimulates basement membrane degradation[]. This complex triggers plasminogen activation which in turn stimulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis[  ]. Once the cell density decreases  the 170 kDa  receptor is synthesized[]. Binding interactions with this 170 kDa cell surface receptor trigger endocytosis of []. Once internalised   triggers a series of cell signalling pathways including second messenger responses  MAPK activation and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 which stimulate cell proliferation  migration and growth[–]. From the cytoplasm   is translocated to the nucleus where it enhances rRNA transcription[].  cleaves rRNA and tRNA and in turn recombinant angiogenin has been shown to act as a cytotoxic tRNase that abolishes protein synthesis[–]. We also revealed a significant number of activators and inhibitors of this pathway e.g. NO  however  only proteins were considered[]. The path of the  protein is highlighted in red boxes  with blue boxes representing the subsequent processes. The genes involved in this process are dictated alongside each process with activators and inhibitors noted outside each process in red (inhibitors) and black (up-regulators and other known binding proteins). Genomic regions affecting milk production and reproductive traits were identified by association analysis using the RNASE5 pathway gene set constructed above. Using the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip  we identified a set of 211 SNP within a 1 Mb region surrounding each gene in the pathway[]. Linear regression analysis with ASReml[] revealed significant associations between the SNP within the RNASE5 pathway gene set and some milk production and reproductive traits in livestock  at P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Many SNP were associated with protein yield  protein percent and milk yield while fewer SNP were associated with fertility  fat yield and fat percent (Table ). For each trait tested  at least half of the genes in the pathway contained significant SNP (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). The genes          and  contained a large number of significant SNP for protein percent and protein yield. In fact  for protein yield there was at least one significant SNP for each gene in the RNASE5 pathway. Eight genes were associated with SNP significant for protein percent. Permutation testing was used to determine the experiment-wise significance of each pathway tested (e.g. accounting for the multiple testing of 211 SNP). For protein percent  only 1.8% of SNP sets from the 10 000 permutations exceeded the observed ratio of significant to non-significant SNP (Figure ). This means that for protein percent the experiment-wise P-value is less than 0.018. For protein yield  10.9% of the SNP sets within the permuted distribution exceeded the observed SNP ratio of 0.227 (Figure ). No other traits approached experiment-wise significance and FDR was high compared to previous studies (Table ). We investigated the extent of pleiotropy for polymorphisms in the RNASE5 pathway by calculating the correlation between SNP effects for significant SNP (Table ). SNP effects for milk volume were negatively correlated with SNP effects for protein percent  fat percent and fat yield (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.720  -0.915 and -0.549  respectively) but were highly correlated with protein yield (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.902). SNP effects for fat percent were highly correlated with SNP effects for fat yield and protein percent (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.838 and 0.763). Interestingly  most of the aforementioned correlations showed higher correlations than the whole genome dataset (Table ). This could be consistent with the fact that these targeted groups of SNP are more highly associated with the traits than would be expected from a random group of SNP. However  the difference between the two sets of correlations was not significant based on a paired  test.  Blue represents the null hypothesis distribution. SNP sets were randomised from 11 gene regions with 10 000 repeats and expressed as a ratio (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). The red line represents the experimental ratio for each trait of interest:  protein percent (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.270)   protein yield (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.227)   fertility (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.085)   fat yield (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.128)   fat percent (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.128) and  milk yield (f-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.190). On bovine chromosome 14   and  lie in close proximity  and  is known to contain a polymorphism affecting milk volume and particularly fat percent in dairy cattle[  ]. To determine if the  polymorphism was responsible for the significant result in our analysis  we re-ran the association model for protein percent and protein yield  with the effect of the polymorphism in  removed from the phenotypes (e.g.  phenotypes corrected for  genotype effect). Removal of the effect of the polymorphism in  did not alter the overall significance of either the SNP in the  gene or the RNASE5 pathway. In this study  we identified an RNASE5 pathway as a potentially novel pathway associated with milk protein percentage in dairy cattle. We described a gene set that includes the genes coding for the main proteins interacting with RNASE5 and most likely to mediate RNASE5 action in mammary epithelial cells. SNP within or in close proximity to these genes explain some of the variation in milk production traits in dairy cattle  particularly for protein percent. RNASE5 may play a role in regulating lactation in the mammary gland similar to its mechanism in angiogenesis  i.e. it may be associated with the proliferation of mammary secretory cells  leading to higher volumes of milk  and higher yields of protein and fat. Certainly  RNASE5 is expressed in the mammary tissue of lactating mice  and is down-regulated during involution of the mammary gland. Since  RNASE5 is known to have a role in protein synthesis it may contribute to increased protein synthesis in milk  however other functions such as regulation of stress responses and apoptosis and even angiogenesis may also contribute to the observed regulatory role in milk. In epithelial cells  RNASE5 is internalized and localizes to the nucleus to stimulate protein synthesis and it is involved in increasing levels of rRNA and their processing. Thus  a similar mechanism may occur in mammary secretory cells but this hypothesis requires further testing. A potential limitation of our study is the density of the SNP panel  which combined with the extended low level of linkage disequilibrium in dairy cattle populations makes the localisation of genetic variants to small genomic regions difficult e.g. []. This limited the confidence in the assignment of the associations observed between significant SNP and nearby genes in the RNASE5 pathway. We attempted to deal with this in two ways. First  we compared the significance of our results to those obtained from a very large number of random permutations  where SNP were chosen to be within the same distance (500 kb) from a randomly chosen set of 11 genes. Protein percent in particular was still significant at the experiment-wise level set by permutation testing. Second  we attempted to account for genes known to harbour genetic variants affecting milk production traits. Specifically  we re-ran the analysis on phenotypes corrected for the effect of the  mutation. However  we still acknowledge the limitation of the marginal SNP density in our experiment. The experiment could be repeated in the future with whole-genome sequence data  for example. The 11 genes identified in the RNASE5 pathway include mainly genes involved in cell binding  structure and motility or with regulatory roles. Interestingly  most of the genes functioning in the extracellular space were not associated with any significant SNP. These include    and .  was associated with only one significant SNP located within the gene. This may suggest that regulation of protein percent by RNASE5 occurs primarily via signalling mechanisms within the cell. Analysis of the sequence variation within these genes may elucidate the true causal variants. In addition  the degree of pleiotropy identified from our correlation analysis suggests that the RNASE5 pathway potentially affects several production traits  and at a higher level of pleiotropy than a similarly sized set of randomly chosen SNP. The pathway-based approach used here may be more powerful to identify associated SNP than a GWAS methodology relying on the large number of associations detected by whole-genome studies. On the one hand  since the focus of this method is to exploit previous information  it may miss new information but on the other hand  it provides a way to analyse large datasets. For example  low frequency variants explaining less of the variation can potentially be identified (due to lower significance thresholds). However  we acknowledge that this method is less relevant when the associated gene pathways are poorly described in the literature. Some of the biological processes in which the  gene and the RNASE5 pathway are involved have been identified but many remain uncharacterised. These include associations between alternative RNASE5 induced pathways  temporal aspects  cell receptor expression and triggers. Additionally  it is likely that there are other binding partners that vary with cell type and environmental conditions. The link between the genes in the RNASE5 pathway and variation in protein percent in bovine milk suggests that RNASE5 may have a hitherto undescribed biological mechanism in the mammary gland. The gene set method that we applied here to the RNASE5 pathway could be used to rapidly assess the role of other emerging pathways and functions with a genetic validation relevant . Pathways with well-established biological steps or those with new biological knowledge as it becomes available are well suited to this type of analysis. The method can potentially identify associations of smaller effect than in standard GWAS  given the less stringent significance threshold required as a result of reduced multiple testing.

For this purpose  the mixture of uniform priors approach is especially suitable  because it comprises a wide and flexible family of distributions and computationally intensive estimation can be carried out in a reasonable amount of time. Genetic association studies  quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and genomic prediction rely on increasingly dense DNA information such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The increasing abundance of marker data amplifies one of the essential statistical problems in such studies: the number of potential explanatory variables represented by single markers is often larger than the number of observations in the sample studied  and some regularization is required to ensure the identifiability of the marker effects. Suitable statistical models can accomplish this regularization by variable (i.e. marker) selection  shrinkage of marker effects towards zero or a combination of these two strategies [–]. Many variable selection and shrinkage techniques based on Bayesian modelling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have been proposed for genetic association studies  QTL mapping and genomic prediction (see [  ]). They differ in the set-up of the statistical model and in their prior specifications. Probably the most popular alternatives are reversible jump MCMC [–]  stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) [  ] and locus-indicator models []. To avoid some of the complications in model selection  saturated models have been proposed in which genetic effects from all possible explanatory markers are collected simultaneously into the model and their identifiability is increased by prior assumptions that result in shrinkage of effect sizes towards zero [    ]. Such a shrinkage-inducing method leads to a solution in which large effects tend to occur only at rather few positions along the genome in the posterior distribution. In a previous study  we presented a new class of shrinkage-inducing priors: a mixture of discrete uniform distributions (MU)  and compared it to other methods in the context of QTL detection []. Compared to methods commonly used in genomic prediction  the main differences and similarities are the following: MU is a shrinkage-based method like BayesA [] and Bayesian LASSO [  ]  but it is richer in the variety of tuning-parameters. This may be bad from a tuning point of view  but the hyper-parameter combinations in the prior specification potentially covers a wider spectrum of different scenarios concerning the genetic architecture of the trait  heritability  marker spacing or structure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the data. Like BayesB [] and SSVS [  ]  MU includes a hyper-parameter for the prior probability of no marker association  but unlike BayesB and SSVS  the prior of MU does not include any indicator variables. Therefore  use of such separate indicator variables is avoided in the estimation algorithms of MU  which otherwise could negatively affect the speed and the mixing properties during MCMC simulation or cause multimodality problems in maximum  estimation (see []). Bayesian shrinkage methods are common tools in genomic prediction  but rigorous decision making in the context of QTL detection via such models is not well established []. Here  we shall examine in more detail the properties of MU  focusing in particular on how robust the results are in the analysis of the well-studied QTLMAS XII data set with tightly linked markers [  ]. In addition  we test the prediction ability for genomic selection purposes in a real data set on a population of pigs []. As suggested in []  MU appears to be sensitive to prior parameters. In this study  we resume the issue of prior sensitivity and we extend the analysis. As a potential solution to the prior sensitivity issue  we define a finite set of prior specifications and use ”poor-man’s” model averaging over these by giving equal probability/weight to each prior setting. We compare these consensus estimates to the presumably less robust ones from single prior specifications. MU comprises a wide and flexible family of prior distributions  because it is controlled by three hyper-parameters instead of two or one as in most other shrinkage approaches without indicators in the model. Furthermore  the prior assumptions in MU provide a coherent framework for formal hypothesis testing and calculation of Bayes factors  which is lacking in most other shrinkage-based variable selection methods []. As another exception with a coherent framework  a decision rule based on Bayes factors has been proposed for the extended Bayesian LASSO []. For MCMC simulation of the posterior distribution  we have implemented a Gibbs sampler  for which we provide the fully conditional distributions in Additional file  and the C code as an extension module to the software package R [] in Additional file . As a faster alternative to MCMC estimation  we have constructed a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for maximum  (MAP) point estimation []  for which we provide the estimation details and the C implementation in Additional file . Consider a population-based sample of  individuals with phenotype measurements  (). Suppose each individual has been scored at  markers and the genotype observation of an individual at marker  () is denoted by . Assuming bi-allelic markers such as SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and only additively acting gene effects  genotype observations are coded as -1 0 and 1 corresponding to the three possible genotypes  say     and . The phenotype of individual  is modelled by the following regression equation Here   is the intercept common to all individuals in the population. Furthermore  each  holds the additive effect of marker   and  the error term for the individual. A complete description of the distributional assumption made to specify the likelihood as well as its mathematical formula are included as supporting information [see Additional file ]. Constant variances are assumed for  and {} in their respective prior specifications  whereas a common random variance  is assumed for the error terms. Conditional on   mutual independence is assumed among the other parameters (  {}  {}). If appropriate  the regression can readily be extended to include a polygenic component with kinship-based variance-covariance structure to account for infinitesimal marker effects and/or background QTL. As typical in this type of Bayesian variable selection approaches  restrictive shrinkage priors are assigned to the effect size parameters to regularise the model  to avoid overfitting and to ensure the identifiability of genetic marker effects. In the following  we describe such an approach  which provides a mechanism to shrink spurious effect sizes towards 0. We use a mixture of three distinct uniform distributions (MU)  the performance of which has been previously evaluated using two well-documented real data sets and comparing it to two other Bayesian variable selection approaches []. Since we used the software package OpenBUGS [] in our previous study to perform MCMC simulation  our report was restricted to samples with much fewer individuals and markers than in this study. Here  we overcome this drawback by a Gibbs sampler implementation for MCMC simulation of the posterior distribution and a GEM algorithm for fast maximum  point estimation in the low-level C programming language. Both types of algorithms are based on the fully conditional univariate posterior distributions and single parameters are updated one at a time; whereas the Gibbs sampler iterates over random draws from these distributions  GEM only iterates over the fully conditional expected values before reaching convergence in a - possibly local - maximum of the parameter space. For a detailed discussion on GEM and its affinity with standard EM and related algorithms see []. The assumptions of the prior distribution are completely specified in the supporting information [see Additional file ]. In Additional file   we also derive the univariate fully conditional posterior distributions needed for a single-site Gibbs sampler and the fully conditional expected values for GEM. The C codes for both algorithms are provided in the supporting information [see Additional files  and ]. In MU  each effect size    is assigned a prior distribution with probability density function where () is the indicator function of a set   i.e. its value is 1 if  and 0 otherwise; furthermore  (0 1) is the prior probability that  obtains a value close to 0 in the interval (- )  with the border value set to >0  and 1- is consequently the prior probability that  lies further away from 0  either in [- -] or in [ ]  with the effect size limit set to >. If the three hyper-parameters    and  are appropriately chosen  this density has a narrow peak around zero and is flat on the rest of its support. Thus  this density is a step function  resembling a spike and a slab []. The slab is sometimes also referred to as a smear (e.g. []). The mixture of three uniform distributions is specified by allocating a major amount of probability mass    on a small interval (- ) that covers 0 and the remaining probability mass  1-  on two intervals that lie symmetrically at either side away from 0. Distributing the probability mass in this way reflects the prior perception that a marker chosen arbitrarily from a large set is unlikely to explain a substantial portion of the phenotypic variation. In other words  most marker effects are expected to be so close to 0 that their contributions can be considered negligible. Biological expert knowledge and practical considerations should determine the choice of the three hyper-parameters. Considering the contribution to the phenotypic variation of effect sizes lying within the spike (||<) as negligible  yields a criterion to discriminate between associated and non-associated markers. However  other aspects such as sample size and coarseness of measurement affect the choice of   because a small sample size and imprecise data reduce the chances to identify small marker effects. If ||= is used as the criterion for QTL identification  the prior belief concerning the total number of associated markers can be directly expressed via the choice of ; the number of markers with ||= has  a binomial distribution with mean (1-) due to the independence assumed among {}. The hyper-parameter  restricts the absolute effect size of a marker to a certain upper limit  which is difficult to quantify   because the genetic architecture of the trait and specifically the distribution of effect sizes are not known. However  empirical studies indicate that effect sizes of more than a few phenotypic standard deviations seem unlikely (see [–]). In the context of regression models for genomic prediction  a rough guideline has been suggested for choosing hyper-parameters in the prior distribution of genetic effects based on a connection between the prior variance of SNP effects and the expected heritability of the trait (cf. []). For MU  the variance of the effect of a single SNP can be easily obtained from Equation () and integration yields Gianola et al. [] derived that under idealized conditions (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  linkage equilibrium between QTLs  and QTL positions coinciding with marker positions). Here   is the additive genetic variance and  the allele frequency at marker . Under these conditions  the narrow-sense heritability  i.e. =/ with  being the phenotypic variance  can be expressed as As pointed out by de los Campos et al. []  if the genotypes at each marker are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 instead of using -1  0  and 1 as genotype codes  the relationship just mentioned becomes Note that the values of  are not restricted to the interval (0 1) but merely to (0 ). Here  it is noteworthy that altering the genotype codes via standardization affects the interpretation of the effect size estimates  since s do not represent additive genetic effects on the phenotype scale in this case. As in our previous study  we calculated the Bayes factor for the hypothesis that the absolute value of the marker effect exceeds a certain threshold value to assess the strength of the association between the phenotype and a single marker . As in any shrinkage-inducing approach  choosing this threshold is arbitrary or needs to be controlled by permutation of the phenotype []. In the case of MU  however  the choice of  as the threshold results in a framework which is coherent with the prior assumptions concerning the effect size   namely that the contribution of markers with effect sizes in the interval (- ) are negligible. By defining an indicator variable =(||)  the posterior probability of the hypothesis can be expressed as (=1|data). To obtain the Bayes factor for the two competing hypotheses : =1 against : =0  the posterior odds is divided by its prior odds [  ]: where the prior probability (=1)=1- is readily available from the prior specification of  in MU. Kass and Raftery [] have suggested the following categories to classify the strength of evidence provided by twice the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor  2ln(BF)  as a slight modification to the categories presented by Jeffreys []: evidence in favour of the hypothesis is considered very strong for values >10  strong for values in (6 10]  positive for values in (2 6]  and not worth more than a bare mention for values in (0 2]  respectively. As mentioned above  the choice of a threshold for the effect size  is generally problematic in shrinkage approaches  whereas the prior specification of MU entails a justification for a specific threshold in MU. Unless indicator variables are integrated into the likelihood of the model (e.g. as in [])  most shrinkage approaches do not provide an unequivocal frame of hypotheses necessary for the Bayes factor. A notable exception is the extended Bayesian LASSO []  where the prior distributions of locus-specific variances depend on regularizing shrinkage parameters  which can be tested for QTL presence via Bayes factors. Besides the choice of a threshold for   another conceptual problem may arise in shrinkage approaches in which improper priors for the effect sizes are used  such as the model proposed in [] as a modification of the approach in []; although the posterior probability (=1|data) and consequently the posterior odds may exist also for improper priors  the prior odds is not available for the complementary hypotheses <|| vs. ||=  because the integral over the prior distribution corresponding to the former hypothesis does not exist. We assessed the sensitivity of single analyses by comparing results under varying prior specifications  and for MCMC additionally under identical prior specifications to detect convergence or mixing problems. In addition  we combined Bayes factor information from different analyses to increase the robustness in detecting association signals. We also evaluated the predictive abilities of our model by comparison of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) either with the true breeding values (TBV)  as available in simulated data sets  or with the phenotype measurements directly  as available in real data sets. The GEBV for individual  is where  is the posterior mean of  in the case of MCMC or the MAP point estimate in the case of the GEM algorithm  and () is the vector of genotype codes for the individual. For cross-validation of our results  we employed the faster GEM algorithm. Also here  we compared estimates from single prior specifications with combined estimates from multiple ones. A more detailed description of these procedures is given in the following sections. This simulated data set was originally distributed as a part of the 12th European workshop on QTL mapping and marker assisted selection (QTLMAS XII) held in Uppsala  Sweden  on 15–16 May 2008. Detailed information on the publicly available data [] has been presented by Crooks et al. [] and Lund et al. []. The simulation of the phenotype involved a total of 50 bi-allelic QTLs with additive effects. Crooks et al. [] classified 15 of these as major QTL (denoted by M1-M15)  because they yield -values of less than 0.05 after Bonferroni correction in a multiple linear regression including all genotypes of true QTLs. The whole data set available for QTL detection consists of 4665 individuals from a pedigree of consecutive generations. We excluded the 165 individuals of the first generation from our analysis  because they do not form full-sib families of size 10 like the 4500 individuals in the subsequent generations. The founders of each generation were 15 males and 150 females. In the first generation  all individuals were used as parents  whereas in the second and third generation  they were randomly sampled. Each male parent was mated to 10 females  each producing 10 full-sib offspring. Thus  the pedigree actually has a full-sib and half-sib structure. However  we did not take into account the familial resemblance between half-sibs or between parents and offspring from consecutive generations in our statistical model. For simplicity  we merely considered polygenic family effects () for full-sib families and extended the regression in Equation () to for individual  () from family  (). The polygenic terms  were assumed conditionally independent random effects with a mean of 0 and a common random variance . Our results are based on =4500 individuals in =450 full-sib families  each of size =10. The marker data consists of 6000 completely genotyped SNP equidistantly spaced by 0.1 cM spanning six chromosomes with 1000 markers each. We removed the 106 markers with minor allele frequency of less than 0.01  yielding =5894 markers for analysis of the complete genome. We ran MCMC simulations for four different sets of prior specifications (see details in Table ). Our first goal was to evaluate the power of MU to detect QTL and the false positive error rate in this data set with tightly-linked markers and to compare the findings with the results from the six association studies reported in []. Secondly  we aimed at assessing the robustness of our results in several MCMC runs under identical and varying prior specifications. For each set of prior specifications  we started two MCMC chains from different starting values. Thus  the results are based on a total of eight chains (marked by A-H). In each run  we simulated 220 000 Gibbs iterations  of which the first 20 000 were discarded as burn-in. This burn-in size was determined based on informal convergence checks. We applied thinning to save disk space and only stored every 20th iteration. Thus  each of the eight runs yielded 10 000 MCMC samples for the analysis of the joint posterior distribution. The MCMC simulation of a single chain took 6 - 6.5 hours on a computer with a 3 GHz dual core processor and a physical memory of 2 GB. All simulations shared the following prior specifications: the upper limit of the effect size parameters  was set to =sd()=2.10  the prior variance of the common intercept  to =10  and the shape and rate parameters (   ) were all set to 0.01 in the inverse-gamma distributions used as priors of the variance components  and  [see Additional file  for the parametrisation of the inverse-gamma distribution]. For an inverse-gamma distribution with shape parameter  and rate parameter   its mean has the value   if >1  and its variance has the value   if >2. Thus  the mean and variance do not exist for our choice of shape and rate parameters because of a heavy right tail. However  the mode exists  with a value of . With both  and  decreasing towards 0  the inverse-gamma distribution approaches the noninformative scale-invariant  but improper prior with density 1/. In addition to the four generations used for QTL detection  the QTLMAS XII data spans over three more generations  providing a validation set for genomic prediction models. Each of these generations holds 400 individuals with complete genotype information and TBV. To assess the predictive abilities of our model  we first calculated GEBV for the validation individuals  using the posterior means of the effect sizes    from the MCMC chains. For simplicity  the estimated family effects    reflecting pedigree information within the training generations  were not taken into account  because the polygenic effect was negligible in our analysis (see Results section)  as well as in a previous study []. Furthermore  the family effects were estimated for full-sib families within the training generations and could thus not be applied to the individuals in the validation generations. We evaluated these GEBV for single prior specifications and their averages across the four prior specifications considered. As in []  we assessed the predictive ability of the GEBV in the validation individuals by three measures: the accuracy was estimated as the Pearson correlation between GEBV and TBV; in addition  the Spearman rank correlation was calculated between GEBV and TBV for the 10% of the individuals with the largest TBV; finally  the bias of GEBV was estimated as the coefficient of regression of TBV on GEBV. We also obtained GEBV from the GEM algorithm and assessed their predictive ability as just described. Again for simplicity  we excluded the family effects    from the model. Instead of using the original phenotype and genotype information  we standardized the phenotype and the genotype codes at each SNP to have a sample mean of 0 and a variance of 1 in the training set. The GEBV were then estimated as above and translated back to the original scale. The GEM algorithm for one prior specification required 3 to 14 seconds and 19 to 125 iterations to converge on the same computer as mentioned above (with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB memory). Convergence was declared when the sum of deviations between current and updated parameter values was smaller than (+2)×10  where +2=5896 is the number of parameters in the model. As TBV are only available in simulated data sets  we also applied a cross-validation (CV) approach as a method to assess predictive ability of the model in real data sets. Here  we used only the 4500 individuals in the three training generations. Specifically  we used two different 10-fold CV strategies: (I) we randomized the data into 10 distinct validation sets  each holding 45 full-sib families  i.e. all members of a family belonged to the same validation set; (II) each of the 10 full-sibs of a family was randomly assigned to a different validation set. To predict GEBV for the individuals of a single validation set  the other nine sets were combined to form the training set. We divided the correlation between GEBV and phenotype by the square root of heritability [] to convert it to an estimate of the accuracy of the GEBV. The bias of GEBV was estimated as the coefficient of regressing phenotype on GEBV. To test the predictive ability of our method in real data  we analysed a pig data set made available by Pig Improvement Company (a Genus company) to the scientific community []. Here  we used one of the five phenotypes provided (T5)  which was recorded for 3184 genotyped individuals and for which a heritability of 0.62 was reported in []. Before analysis  the trait was standardized to have a sample mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. A total of 52 843 SNP were contained in the genotype data made public. The original genotype codes were 0  1  and 2 for the three SNP genotypes  respectively  and for missing genotypes (< 1%)  a non-integer between 0 and 2 had been imputed (see [] for details). For our analysis  genotype codes were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 at each SNP. Here  we used four subsets of these SNP: (i) a random set of 10 000 SNP from the entire SNP data; (ii) a random pick of 1000 SNP from the set in (i); (iii) a subset of 10 000 SNP  each with a minor allele frequency > 0.05 and filtered from the entire SNP data by sure independence screening (SIS) of the marginal correlations between the phenotype and SNP []; (iv) a subset of 1000 SNP  also each with a minor allele frequency > 0.05 and filtered from the entire SNP data by SIS; this was a subset of the set in (iii). Note that the set of 10 000 SNP filtered by SIS is identical to the one used in []. We report results including prediction accuracies for all four sets of SNP (i)-(iv). As the results obtained from other Bayesian approaches were shown to be nearly unaffected by the inclusion of pedigree information in this data set []  we chose not to include a polygenic component in this part of the analysis. For parameter estimation  we applied the GEM algorithm and considered numerous combinations of the hyper-parameters  and   which ranged from 0.9 to 0.9999 and from 0.0001 to 0.036  respectively. The hyper-parameter  was kept constant at 2. The accuracy of GEBV was estimated by their correlation with phenotypic values divided by the square root of the reported heritability  i.e. . The breeding value of an individual was predicted via 10-fold cross-validation  in which each individual was randomly assigned to one of 10 subsets. Each of these subsets was used once as the validation set  with the other nine subsets forming the training set. By using the same subsets as in []  our results are directly comparable to the ones obtained in that study. We also obtained an estimate for the bias of GEBV as the coefficient of regression of the phenotype on GEBV. It is important to note that  similar to []  the pre-selection by SIS was done using  individuals  i.e. it was influenced not only by training but also by validation individuals  and may have caused the subsequent cross-validation procedure to over-estimate the accuracies. We begin with an overview of the posterior estimation for the model parameters  with the exception of marker-specific parameters and compare results obtained from the eight MCMC chains A-H. Table  shows the varying prior specifications of the MCMC chains and posterior results for model parameters and summary statistics. The values for the border parameter    are given in units of phenotypic standard deviations (sd()=2.10). We defined a summary statistic for the number of QTL based on the marker-specific indicator variables by   and for the heritability due to marker effects by   where the sample variance var() was used as an approximation of the phenotypic variance  ignoring the relatedness between the individuals studied. Here  the variance component  of the polygenic effects was multiplied by a factor 2  because the coefficient of the additive genetic covariance between full sibs is 1/2 (see e.g. chapter 7 in []). For the common intercept  somewhat higher deviations of the posterior results were observed between chains with identical prior specifications when the border value of the effect sizes was set to =0.01 (chains A vs. B and E vs. F) than when it was set to =0.001 (chains C vs. D and G vs. H). Thus  at least for these parameters  the prior specification =0.001 yielded more robust results. All chains produced virtually identical estimates for the residual variance . The point estimates for the between-family variance  were of about two orders of magnitude smaller than . This indicates that the polygenic effects    absorbed rather little phenotypic variation in the simultaneous analysis of all chromosomes  which is consistent with the results reported by Lund et al. []. Since the genetic variation in the data was explained almost completely by the marker effects  little information would be lost if the polygenic terms were excluded from the model. In the analysis of only one chromosome  the polygenic terms played a more influential role (results not shown)  since they can absorb genetic effects from the rest of the genome (cf. []). Although the estimates for  were small when analysing the complete genome  we observe differences between prior specifications: more phenotypic variation was explained by the polygenic effects when =0.001  i.e. in chains C  D  G and H  since  obtained larger posterior means in these chains than in the others. This also explains the slightly higher estimates of  for =0.01. Here  we should note that the true heritability of the trait for the full pedigree data is 0.30 []  which closely coincides with our estimates  which ranged from 0.27 to 0.32. Estimates of the summary statistic  for the number of QTL were  as expected  higher for the chains with =0.99  i.e. with a smaller prior probability of marker exclusion. Here we note that the prior mean of  is ·(1-). Thus for =0.99  the posterior mean values between 24 and 33 were lower than the prior mean of 60. In contrast  the prior mean of  was 6 for =0.999  but the posterior means were larger with values ranging from 14 to 22. In this sense  the intuition that the prior specifications with =0.999 are more conservative is confirmed. We also observed that the chains with =0.01 produced lower posterior means of  for fixed . This result is intuitive also  since marker indicators are expected to reach the value 1 more easily  when the interval (- ) is shortened. Two of our main goals were (1) to assess how well MU identifies true QTL in this data set and (2) to evaluate the risk of false positive QTL detection when applying the Bayes factor as the measure of the evidence in favour of marker association. In Table 2  the 20 markers with the strongest signals in our analysis are listed. Here  we used the following criterion to rank the strengths of association from all =5894 markers: for each marker  we calculated the Bayes factor for the hypothesis =1 (see above  ) in each of the eight MCMC chains A-H. Next  we ranked the Bayes factors within each chain and calculated a marker-specific mean rank across chains as a measure to summarize information from the eight chains. This was done to increase the robustness in assessing the strength of evidence by making the results less dependent on the specific choices of the hyper-parameters in single MCMC chains. For each of these 20 markers  their position in the genome  minor allele frequency and distance to the closest true major QTL are given in Table  (cf. Table one of []). The minor allele frequencies of the true QTL were added as a reference. The table also provides the posterior means of 2 ln(BF) as a consensus measure of evidence  the minimal and maximal means across the chains  and the absolute values of the effect sizes (||) for the true major QTL as reported in []. Here we should note that  in the case of a single value of an effect size  it is sufficient to report only the absolute value  since the sign of the value will depend on the genotype coding of the data set. Of course  our estimates also depend on the genotype coding. Nevertheless  we report the signed posterior means of the effect sizes  ()  from our analysis  because the minima and maxima from the eight MCMC chains could have opposite signs – although this did not happen for the 20 markers reported. Finally  the posterior means of the percentage of phenotypic variance explained are given in Table . They were calculated by . Here  MAF is the minor allele frequency of marker    the posterior mean of   and var() is as defined above. Note that ( PVE) are estimates for single markers and simply summing them up does not yield an estimate for the entire proportion of variance explained by markers  as covariances due to LD between markers are missed in this sum. However  the proportion of variance accounted for by the regression on markers is captured in our estimates  (see Table ). Twelve of the 15 major true QTL were located within 5 cM from the markers reported in Table . In the comparative study of six association analyses  Crooks et al. [] considered a QTL to be identified correctly if a positive signal was reported within 5 cM from the QTL. The most successful study by Ledur et al. [] detected 11 true major QTL (see Table four in []). No study compared in [] identified the true major QTL M7  whereas we found a marker with a signal of association within 2.01 cM of that QTL. The only study identifying M9 was Ledur et al. []  who found an association with exactly the same marker as we did  namely at 60.1 cM on chromosome 3. Another QTL  M14 at 5.15 cM  was identified by only one study: Bink and van Eeuwijk [] detected a signal at 2.0 cM  but the marker we identified at 4.2 cM is somewhat closer to this QTL. Three true major QTL  namely M5  M10 and M11  are absent from Table . M5 is very close to M4  at 2.59 cM from M4 at position 30.00 cM on chromosome 2. Each of the six analyses compared in [] identified either M4 or M5 only. M10 at position 3.2 cM on chromosome 4 was identified by all six studies and explained 4% of the phenotypic variance. It is therefore quite intriguing that our results regarding M10 contrast so markedly. M11 was identified only by Cleveland and Deeb []. In the list of the 20 markers with the strongest signals in our analysis  two markers were more than 5 cM from a major true QTL and would have been considered false positives in []: one of them  at position 54.1 cM on chromosome 3  was 5.9 cM from M9 (at 60.00 cM)  and the other  at 85.9 cM on chromosome 4  was located about midway between M12 (at 76.06 cM) and M13 (at 96.49 cM). Up to now  we have considered an arbitrary number  namely 20  of markers showing the strongest signals of association across different MCMC chains. In many empirical studies  a decision making tool is used to classify markers into two groups: markers with ”significant” and ”non-significant” QTL signals. For this purpose  one can apply a threshold of  say  10 to the average of 2 ln(BF) across the chains when multiple chains are considered. Sixteen of the markers shown in Table  fulfil this criterion and four do not. In addition to the three true major QTL mentioned above (M5  M10  M11)  M14 would also remain unidentified if this criterion was used. Moreover  the markers at 54.1 cM on chromosome 3 and at 85.9 cM on chromosome 4 would still be false positives  with both Bayes factors exceeding the threshold. Three of the six analyses compared in [] produced no false positive signals. To achieve this level of type I error  the threshold has to be set to 12 in our analysis. This would result in missing two additional QTL (M7 and M8) and the total number of detected QTL would decrease to nine. One study (with no false positives) detected more QTL  namely that of Ledur et al. []  with 11 QTL. However  this study also exploited haplotype information. As shown in Table   the Bayes factors varied rather little across chains for some markers and a lot for others: e.g. the minimal and maximal 2ln-transformed Bayes factors were 28 and 32  respectively  for the marker at 19.5 cM on chromosome 1  but were 4 and 16 for the marker at 96.6 cM on chromosome 4. Thus  the latter marker showed very strong evidence in one chain but ”only” positive evidence in another one  according to the classification by Kass and Raftery []. To quantify the robustness among the eight MCMC chains  we calculated pairwise Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients  between the chains for the 20 Bayes factors reported in Table  (see the upper right triangle in Table ). When comparing chains with identical prior specifications  the strongest pairwise agreement was observed between chains A and B (=0.99 and =0.01)  with a correlation of 0.99  and the weakest agreement between chains C and D (=0.999 and =0.001)  with a correlation equal to 0.84. For chains with different prior specifications  the correlation coefficient obtained its lowest value  0.67  between chains C and E  which differ in both  and . We also report the ratios of the 2 × log-transformed Bayes factors averaged across the 20 markers for pairs of chains in the lower left triangle of Table . These mean ratios give an indication of the differences in magnitude of the Bayes factors between the chains. On average  chains A  B and C yielded the largest Bayes factors of about the same magnitude. The largest differences in Bayes factors were observed between chains A and H and between chains B and H  both having mean ratios equal to 0.68. The comparison of GEBV and TBV in the three validation generations showed accuracies between 0.79 and 0.90 for MCMC-based and GEM-based estimation under the four prior specifications considered (see Table ). The Bayesian genomic prediction approaches compared in [] achieved accuracies ranging from 0.84 to 0.92 and the methods compared in [] from 0.70 to 0.90. The best results reported by [] and [] (0.90 and 0.88  respectively) fall within this range. The accuracy of GEBV obtained by frequentist G-BLUP estimation has previously been reported at 0.75 and of GEBV obtained from Bayesian G-BLUP at 0.76 []. The rank correlation between GEBV and TBV for the 10% of individuals with the highest TBV ranged from 0.42 to 0.57  whereas [] reported corresponding values between 0.46 and 0.56. Estimates of bias ranged from 0.84 to 0.98 in our analyses and from 0.85 to 0.98 in []. The accuracies from GEM were somewhat lower than from MCMC for single prior specifications  but averaging the GEBV across prior specifications  i.e. the combined estimates  yielded similar accuracy estimates  0.89 for MCMC and 0.88 for GEM. Notably  the combined estimate for GEM was higher than any of the estimates from single prior specifications. Likewise  the rank correlations ranged from only 0.42 to 0.51 for GEM under single prior specifications  while the combined estimate was 0.53. The corresponding value for MCMC was again somewhat higher (0.56). In contrast  GEM yielded a slightly better value (0.98) for the combined estimate of bias  i.e. the regression coefficient was closer to 1  than the estimate of bias from MCMC (0.94). The accuracies obtained by cross-validation within the first three generations via GEM were higher ( and  from 0.91 to 0.96) than those reported above for the three validation generations. This result supports the expectation that accuracy of GEBV declines for genetically more distant individuals. We did not observe clear differences in the results between the two cross-validation approaches  although keeping the individuals from an entire family together in the same validation set (approach I) increases the genetic distance between training and prediction sets more than assigning individuals from the same family to different validation sets (approach II). Also for cross-validation  averaging GEBV across prior specifications improved accuracy  when compared to single prior specifications. However  averaging increased estimates of bias ( and )  from values below 1 for single prior specifications to values above 1 for the combined estimates. Finally  we used Equations () and () to calculate values of  heritability under the four different prior specifications. As mentioned above  Equations () and () do not restrict  heritability to the range from 0 to 1. For the non-standardized genotype codes used in MCMC estimation  the four prior specifications as ordered in Table  correspond to -values of 7.9  7.7  0.86 and 0.78  respectively. For the standardized genotype codes used in GEM estimation  the corresponding -values are 20.0  19.7  2.2 and 2.0  respectively. Thus  impossible values for heritability  i.e. with values above 1  were implicitly assumed in most of the prior specifications. However  reasonable estimates of accuracy were obtained in all cases and the  heritabilities varied far more in magnitude than estimates of accuracy. For the tested combinations of  from 0.9 to 0.9999 and  from 0.0001 to 0.036  the best accuracy  with a value of 0.631  was obtained with =0.9999 and =0.008 for the set of 10 000 random SNP (RAND10K). For this combination of  and   the accuracy for the 10 000 SNP filtered by SIS (SIS10K) was only slightly lower  with a value of 0.623. The highest value reported in [] was 0.63 for two Bayesian model variants with hierarchical Laplace shrinkage priors. In the same study  the accuracy for Bayesian G-BLUP was reported at 0.63. The prior expectation about heritability (cf. Equation ()) under idealized conditions corresponds to a value of 1.6 for this specific prior specification and 10 000 SNP. It is noteworthy that values of <0.008 yielded lower accuracies  despite the fact that they corresponded to more realistic  i.e. lower  values of heritability  which was 0.62 for this trait. As shown in Figure   the estimated accuracies were highly sensitive to the choice of  and  for SIS10K and RAND10K  deteriorated with  approaching 0 and >0.015. In contrast  both RAND1K and SIS1K exhibited the best accuracies for >0.015  showing horizontally asymptotic-like behaviour for increasing values of . The accuracies were quite similar for RAND10K and SIS10K  except for  ranging between 0.015 and 0.03  where SIS10K yielded higher accuracies. In all cases  RAND1K had lower accuracies than SIS1K. As mentioned above  the higher accuracies for SIS may be  at least partially  due to the over-estimation induced during pre-selection by SIS.                                                                                                                                                                  For all values of   the accuracy showed very similar behaviour when  was varied. For both RAND10K and SIS10K  accuracies were best for  ranging between 0.005 and 0.012 and deteriorated when  tended towards 0 and also for increasing values of . In contrast  both RAND1K and SIS1K exhibited the best accuracies for >0.015  showing horizontally asymptotic-like behaviour for increasing values of . In all cases  RAND1K had lower accuracies than SIS1K. For both RAND10K and SIS10K  the least biased estimates  i.e. with regression coefficients closest to 1  were obtained for  between 0.002 and 0.008 and deteriorated down to 0.2 for increasing values of . For RAND1K and SIS1K  the bias was more stable with respect to   with the exception of a considerable bias upward for =0.9999 and  between 0.006 and 0.015. Tables a  b  c and d show the estimates of accuracy and bias for the four SNP sets and the 16 prior specifications of the hyper-parameter pair ( )  as well as the combined estimates obtained from averaging GEBV across the prior specifications. In contrast to the observations made in the analysis of the QTLMAS XII data  averaging GEBV did not consistently improve the accuracies of single prior specifications. Whereas the best single estimate for SIS10K was 0.62 and the estimate combined across all 16 prior specifications was also 0.62  at least one single estimate in each of the three other SNP sets was slightly superior to the corresponding estimate combined from 16 prior specifications. In this article  we successfully applied MU  a shrinkage-based Bayesian variable selection that we had previously presented in []  to the well studied and publicly available QTLMAS XII and real data sets with genome-wide marker coverage. In particular  we focussed our attention on comparing the impact of different prior specifications on the stability of QTL detection for genetic association and the stability of breeding value prediction for genomic selection. A Gibbs sampler for MCMC simulation and a GEM algorithm for MAP point estimation were implemented as C extensions to the software package R []. The source codes are publicly available as supporting information [see Additional files  and ]. The computation time required by the implementations on a desktop PC appears feasible  being maximally a few hours for MCMC and a few minutes for GEM. We have compared our results regarding QTL detection and false positive signals to findings from previous studies of the QTLMAS XII data. Overall  our analyses by MU ranked well among the association and mapping methods that were summarized by Crooks et al. []. Only one method [] clearly outperformed MU. Instead of single SNP  this method exploited haplotype information of multiple SNP. Arguably  integration of this additional information into the regression model via a revised genotype matrix could improve the performance of MU. Especially in the context of QTL detection  the collinearity of the putative predictors (SNP) in genome-wide dense marker data may cause problems in multi-locus models that assume mutual independence of predictors   such as scattering of QTL signals over several markers. Several authors have suggested procedures to improve model performance in such settings: for example removing part of the data to reduce the collinearity (e.g. []). This general problem of applying MU and other Bayesian variable selection or shrinkage methods needs further research to improve their performance in QTL mapping. The rather strong positive correlations among Bayes factors with QTL signals observed in several MCMC chains suggest an appreciable robustness of the results with regard to QTL detection under varying prior assumptions. Besides its advantages (see e.g. [  –]) over such measures as -values  the systematic differences in magnitude  that we observed between the Bayes factors from different MCMC chains  demonstrate the problems and limitations of the categories suggested by Jeffreys [] and Kass and Raftery []. Specifically  blind application of decision rules based on these categories to declare positive QTL signals in genetic association and QTL mapping studies seem inadvisable. We stress the importance of an exhaustive analysis under varying prior assumptions. This need for a wide-ranging analysis is specifically evident  because  in general  weak prior knowledge exists on relevant biological parameters such as the prior probability of a positive QTL signal and the shape of the prior distributions for genetic effects. We tried to alleviate this problem by combining Bayes factor information from several analyses under varying prior specifications. Obviously  an exhaustive sensitivity analysis under varying prior assumptions is necessary in shrinkage-based or other Bayesian variable selection approaches in general. However  we argue that MU provides some solution to the open problem of selecting relevant variables in Bayesian shrinkage approaches (see [])  because MU provides a formal framework for hypothesis testing and consequently for the calculation of Bayes factors  in contrast to most other shrinkage approaches. For the purpose of genomic prediction  MU was competitive with other studies in the estimation of GEBV for both data sets. For the simulated QTLMAS XII data set  it is noteworthy that we considered only four prior specifications in our analysis and did not attempt an exhaustive coverage of the hyper-parameter space. For this data set  our main focus was to compare MCMC and GEM estimations. Although point estimation via the GEM algorithm produced accuracies of GEBV that were inferior to accuracies from point estimation by MCMC for the single prior specifications  accuracy for GEM estimation was improved by combining GEBV across prior specifications to almost the same level as MCMC results. In the analysis of the real data set  we explored a larger part of the hyper-parameter space and considered a dense grid of hyper-parameter values. Thus  we were able to assess accuracies of GEBV and differences more comprehensively than for the QTLMAS XII data set. Our results showed that the estimated accuracies were very sensitive to the choice of the hyper-parameter  in MU and that the sensitivity increased with the number of markers. Unfortunately  comparison of the sensitivity with other Bayesian genomic prediction approaches was hampered  because accuracies from an extensive search across varying prior specifications in other approaches are not documented for this data set. In very poorly stated problems with many more SNP than individuals  as in the real data set  it may be beneficial to decrease the number of SNP to reduce this disparity prior to variable selection [  ]. This will save computer storage capacity and may provide better convergence properties for the algorithms. In this study  we compared random sampling of SNP with sure independence screening (SIS) [] as two simple methods of SNP pre-selection. For SIS  we followed the pre-selection and cross-validation procedure by [] to be able to compare MU with the Bayesian genomic prediction methods considered in that study. Our results suggest that MU is competitive with other approaches and SIS produces superior accuracies for GEBV on large parts of the hyper-parameter space  although random sampling and SIS produce almost identical accuracies in the case of 10 000 SNP under optimally chosen hyper-parameters. However  the absolute level of SIS accuracy estimates reported here may be biased upward  because SIS pre-selection depended not only on the training sets but also on the validation sets. This bias may hamper the comparison of SIS and random sampling results. Pre-selection of SNP surely remains an issue for future research and SIS cannot be the final solution  since some drawbacks of SIS remain unresolved. Because SIS exploits only marginal correlations between markers and the phenotype  and LD between markers is ignored  this approach is associated with a risk that too many SNP in the proximity of a QTL  that carry essentially identical information  are pre-selected. In contrast  SNP with a low marginal correlation but still in LD with a QTL have no chance of entering the set of pre-selected SNP. Methods that simultaneously exploit the connection between SNP and the phenotype and the LD structure between markers could be more appropriate. Three approaches are available for choosing hyper-parameters. First  cross-validation can be employed to detect the optimal prior configuration with respect to the assessment of prediction for some specific set of individuals. This approach is probably the most suitable and most widely used approach for prediction purposes in experimental studies. Second  prior expectation about the heritability and limiting assumptions about the genetic architecture of the trait yield a criterion to calibrate hyper-parameters via the prior variance of additive genetic effect sizes. In this study  we derived such a criterion for MU and tested its performance in the analysis of the real data. However  the results do not support the idea that values of hyper-parameters corresponding to realistic heritabilities according to this criterion positively affect prediction accuracy. As a third alternative to choose hyper-parameters  expert knowledge may be available on the size of hyper-parameters. However  these three approaches are not free of error in practical situations and  therefore  doubt will remain for any specific prior choice. Combining results from varying prior specifications using ”poor man’s” model averaging  as was done here  may provide some solution  as a wider choice of hyper-parameters can be integrated into ”consensus” estimates. For this purpose  an approach like MU is especially suitable  because it comprises a wide and flexible family of prior distributions. To reduce the problem induced by the sensitivity to the choice of hyper-parameters  it is common practice in Bayesian modeling to add an extra layer to the hierarchy and to assign own prior distributions to at least some of the hyper-parameters. This is commonly done  for example  in Bayesian LASSO and stochastic search variable selection methods such as BayesCn and BayesDn (see e.g. []). We have refrained from doing so in this study  for the following reasons: (1) the sensitivity problem may just be moved to the next layer of the hierarchy and the method may then become sensitive to the parameters controlling the prior distribution of a hyper-parameter (see [])  and (2) even if the approach may work in MCMC implementation  the hyper-parameter may not be identifiable in faster maximum  estimation algorithms such as EM  GEM or variational Bayes algorithms (e.g.  [  ]). This behaviour would possibly have a negative impact on the performance of the GEM estimation algorithm that was introduced in this study to make the MU method scalable for large SNP panels with thousands of variables and individuals. Finally  assigning priors to hyper-parameters may result in bad separation of QTL signals []  which is less important in genomic prediction but of major concern in genetic association studies.

Designs or datasets should have at least 100 sires each with 100 offspring. The term “genotype by environment (G × E) interaction” refers to the fact that the best genotype in one environment may not be the best genotype in another environment[] and that genotypes differ in their response to environmental factors  which means that genetic variance for environmental sensitivity or phenotypic plasticity exists[]. Some environmental factors (e.g.  temperature  soil  diet  etc.) are identifiable and can be categorised (e.g.  temperate or tropical climate) or quantified (e.g.  temperature) and thus are referred to as macro-environmental factors. Other environmental factors are unknown and referred to as micro-environmental factors[]. Therefore  genetic variance in macro-environmental sensitivity is the genetic variance due to known environmental factors and can be expressed as the genetic variance in the slope of a reaction norm when environments can be quantified on a continuous scale. If environments are categorized  then phenotypes in different environments are considered as separate traits and the genetic covariances between environments are a measure of genetic variation in macro-environmental sensitivity. Genetic variance in micro-environmental sensitivity is the genetic variance due to unknown environmental factors and can be expressed as differences in environmental variance  sometimes called genetic heterogeneity of environmental variance[]. Numerous studies in the last 70 years have studied G × E interactions or genetics of macro-environmental sensitivity in animal and plant breeding as well as in evolutionary biology[–]. Different modeling approaches have been used[]. In recent years  reaction norm models have been applied in animal breeding to better understand the environmental factors that determine G × E interactions[–]. In evolutionary genetics  many experiments on Drosophila and other laboratory species have been carried out to understand the genetics of macro-environmental sensitivity or phenotypic plasticity[    ]. Other examples of studies on wild life populations include analyses of great tit[] and butterfly[] populations that showed the existence of genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity to temperature change. The genetics of micro-environmental sensitivity or environmental variance have been studied less extensively than the genetics of macro-environmental sensitivity. In evolutionary genetics  several studies have focused on canalization  i.e. selection for reduced variance[–]. Recently  there has been renewed interest on this topic due to the development of methods to estimate genetic variance in environmental variance  e.g. Bayesian methods[  ] and double hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLM) in a REML setting[]. Hill and Mulder[] reviewed 14 studies on this subject and concluded that there is empirical evidence for the existence of genetic variance in environmental variance. Although there is substantial evidence for genetic variance in macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities  very few studies have studied them together or studied their genetic relationship. Jinks and Pooni[] postulated the concepts of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivity and studied both in  but did not investigate the relationships between these two types of environmental sensitivity. However  Perkins and Jinks[] reported that both types of environmental sensitivity were weakly genetically correlated for most traits in . In a study on   Wu[] showed that micro-environmental sensitivity was less heritable than macro-environmental sensitivity and that they were weakly genetically correlated. In another paper  also on   Wu and O'Malley[] detected different sets of genes for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities. In a mapping study of QTL for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities in barley  Kraakman et al.[] identified only a few QTL for micro-environmental sensitivity  but did not detect any QTL for macro-environmental sensitivity. Yampolsky and Scheiner[] observed a weak genetic correlation between developmental noise  similar to micro-environmental sensitivity  and macro-environmental sensitivity in . In   both positive and negative genetic correlations between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities have been reported[  ]. In farm animals  the genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities has not been investigated. In addition  to date  no suitable method was available to estimate such correlations in outbred populations and the requirements in terms of number of families and family sizes of the designs necessary to estimate genetic parameters of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities were unknown. The objectives of this study were to extend the double hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM) of Rönnegård et al.[] with a reaction norm model to estimate genetic variance for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities and to investigate bias and precision of estimated variance components in designs resembling dairy cattle populations. In addition  we evaluated Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) using approximated h-likelihood to select the best fitting model and studied situations in which true genetic and best fitting statistical models differed. Finally  we applied the model to lactation milk yield in dairy cattle. In this section  we describe the assumed quantitative genetic model underlying genetic variance for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities  the statistical model to estimate genetic variance in macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities  and the AIC based on an approximation of the h-likelihood that can be used to select the best fitting model. Finally  we present the simulation used to test the statistical model and describe the evaluated scenarios as well as an application to milk yield in dairy cattle. Here  we assume that genetic variance for macro-environmental sensitivity is expressed as the genetic variation in the slope of a linear reaction norm. Genetic variance in micro-environmental sensitivity implies that genotypes respond differently to one or several unknown environmental factors and thus  we assume that it is expressed as genetic variance in environmental variance according to an exponential model[]. Thus  the quantitative genetic model underlying genetic variance in macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities can be formulated as: where  is the phenotype   is the population mean for the phenotype   is the environmental parameter (continuous or discrete) that cause genotypes to respond differently and  are the additive genetic or breeding values for the intercept  for the slope of the reaction norm (= macro-environmental sensitivity)  and for the environmental variance (= micro-environmental sensitivity)  respectively  is the environmental variance of the exponential model and  is a scaled environmental deviation with variance one. Note that the average environmental variance is[]. The additive genetic values  and  have variance The basis of the statistical model is the DHLGM as presented by Rönnegård et al.[]. The original DHGLM algorithm in Rönnegård et al.[] iterates between a linear mixed model for the phenotypic observations:  =  = phenotypic observation of animal ; and a Gamma GLM for the residual variance   where is the squared estimated residual of  and  is the diagonal element of the hat-matrix of  corresponding to []. Felleki et al.[] extended the model of[] by allowing estimation of the genetic covariance () between the genetic effect in the mean model and the genetic effect in the variance model (Equation ()) in the absence of a linear reaction norm model and reported on computational details and a theoretical assessment of this algorithm. In brief  equivalent to using a Gamma GLM  linearizing around its current fitted value results in vector  and yields the following bivariate linear model: where  is the incidence matrix for fixed effects for  ()   is the vector with solutions for fixed effects for ()   is the incidence matrix for relating observations of () to the additive genetic values  for phenotype (environmental variance)  where  is the additive genetic or numerator relationship matrix and is the genetic variance of (). The residuals of  () and  () are assumed to be independent normally distributed  and and are scaling variances  which are expected to be equal to 1  because  and  already contain the reciprocals of the residual variances per observation. Estimating and allows more flexibility. An iterative estimation procedure is required to obtain estimates for all parameters because of the dependence of the model for  on the results of the model for  and vice versa. The vector  and the diagonals of  and  are updated at each iteration until convergence. The model in Equation () can be considered as combining the DHGLM method[] with the iterative method of Mulder et al.[]. In order to consider macro- and micro-environmental sensitivity simultaneously  the model for phenotype  in Equation () was extended with a linear reaction norm model to estimate genetic variance in macro-environmental sensitivity  whereas the residual variance model using  estimates the genetic variance in micro-environmental sensitivity or environmental variance. Instead of using an animal model  we used a sire model because implementation of the animal model DHGLM resulted in severely biased estimates of variance components with single observations per animal. As an indication of poor model fit  implementation of the animal model DHGLM gave a lower adjusted profile h-likelihood (see next section “Model selection”) than an animal model without heterogeneity of residual variance. Sire models are commonly used in combination with reaction norm models[    ]. In the reaction norm model  we assumed that the environmental parameter  (see Equation ()) is known without error and does not need to be estimated from the data. The resulting combined macro–micro environmental sensitivity sire model can be formulated as: where is a vector with linearized values of transformed squared residuals (see calculation in Appendix)   and  are respectively the incidence matrices for the sire effects for the intercept of the reaction norm and for the environmental variance   is the matrix with the environmental parameter  as a covariate for the sire effects for the slope of the reaction norm  and    and  are the vectors with the estimated sire effects for intercept  slope  and environmental variance. The sire effects     and  are assumed trivariate normally distributed  assuming that sire (co)variances are a quarter of the additive genetic variance. The residuals of  and () are assumed to be independent normally distributed  because cov( <U+2009>)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  when  is normally distributed ()  where and are scaling variances for the residual variances in a sire model. Computations of  and of the diagonals of  and  are different due to the use of a sire model compared to an animal model and are explained in the Appendix. The algorithm was implemented by iterating over several runs of ASReml[]. In each ASReml run  REML-estimates of the variance components were obtained for the current values of    and . The vector  and the diagonals of  and  were updated after each ASReml run. On simulated data  10 ASReml runs were sufficient to obtain converged parameter estimates. ASReml was run with an option to check whether the variance-covariance matrices were positive definite and were forced to be positive definite[] if they were not. When working with real data  the true genetic model is not known  thus statistical inference can be used to find the statistical model that fits the data best. The h-likelihood concept can be applied when using DHGLM[]  in which the adjusted profile h-likelihood (APHL) is used to assess the significance of variance components. Because we use an iterative reweighted least square approximation in ASReml  the APHL can be approximated from the log REML likelihood () for the bivariate model in Equation () fitted in ASReml  after correcting for the fact that the squared estimated residuals of  are used to compute the response variable  (see Appendix for derivation): where is the weight for the variance model for observation   i.e. the  diagonal of . Note that Equation () can also be used for animal models by replacing elements and with the corresponding elements of Equation (). To compare nested and non-nested models  we propose to use APHL in combination with Akaike’s information criterion (AIC): where t is the number of variance parameters. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the bias and precision of the estimated genetic parameters of the model and proposed algorithm. Populations of paternal half-sib families were simulated  resembling a simplified population structure in an animal breeding context with large half-sib offspring groups per sire like in dairy cattle. Either the number of sires (50  100 or 200) was varied while keeping the number of offspring per sire at 100  or the number of offspring per sire (20  50  100 or 200) was varied while keeping the number of sires at 100. Sires and dams were assumed unrelated and were not selected. The offspring had phenotypes but the dams or sires did not. Phenotypes were generated for offspring according to the quantitative genetic model in Equation (). Dams were randomly assigned to herds (herd size = 100 cows) and their offspring (daughters in the case of dairy cattle) were in the same herd. For each herd  the environmental covariate  was sampled from N(0 1). No fixed effects other than a general mean were simulated ( = 0) but offspring were randomly allocated to contemporary groups with size 10 to investigate the effect of fixed effects on the precision of genetic parameters. Additive genetic effects were sampled from N( <U+2009><U+2009><U+2009>). Different values for genetic variances and genetic correlations were used for simulation. Table  gives an overview of the parameter values used in the simulation  both the default and alternative values. In each scenario  only one parameter was varied at a time  i.e. other parameters were kept at their default values. For each set of parameters  100 replicates were generated and means and standard deviations of estimates were calculated across replicates. First  we tested situations in which the true genetic and statistical models contained both types of environmental sensitivities for different sets of genetic parameters and designs. In addition  we investigated the power of AIC to select the correct model given the true genetic model. Three situations were simulated with default parameters: presence of genetic variance in (i) macro- or (ii) micro-environmental sensitivity or in (iii) both. Four statistical models were applied to these simulated situations: a combined macro–micro environmental sensitivity model “macro–micro”  a macro-environmental sensitivity model “macro”  a micro-environmental sensitivity model “micro” and a simple model “simple” with only one additive genetic effect for the phenotype. The “macro–micro” model and the “micro” model were run for 10 ASReml runs to update the weights and the transformed squared residuals  whereas the “macro” model and the “simple” model required only one ASReml run. AIC (Equation ) was used to select the best fitting model. Finally  we tested scenarios in which the statistical model deviated from the true genetic model used for simulation  i.e. when model selection failed to select the right model (Table ). These scenarios were analyzed to explore whether genetic parameters are biased when the statistical model deviates from the true genetic model and whether macro-environmental sensitivity can be detected with a micro-environmental sensitivity model or vice versa. These scenarios were run with the default set of parameters as listed in Table  but with various values of and. Scenarios for which the true genetic and statistical models were the same and included either macro or micro-environmental sensitivity were not analyzed since these have been previously investigated  i.e. see[] for macro-environmental sensitivity and[] for micro-environmental sensitivity. The “macro–micro”  “macro”  “micro” and “simple” models were applied to 305-day lactation milk yield of 142 565 first parity Swedish Holstein cows. Lactation yields were calculated based on test-day data  as described in[] using the test-day interval method[]. Seasons were defined as three-month periods (January-March  April-June  July-September  October-December). Herd-year-season (HYS) classes with less than five cows were excluded. Data on a total of 762 sires with on average 187 daughters were available and 213 of these sires had more than 100 daughters. In the model for phenotype ()  HYS was a fixed effect and in the model for residual variance ()  HYS was a random effect to allow regression to the mean with few observations per HYS and avoid extreme HYS estimates. The model for  included a fixed fourth order polynomial for age at calving and a fixed ninth-order polynomial for lactation length  while the model for  included a third and a sixth order polynomial for age at calving and lactation length  respectively. The orders of polynomials were determined using a Wald test in univariate models for  and  and were kept the same for “macro–micro”  “macro”  “micro” and “simple” models. Herd-year average milk yield standardized to a mean of zero and a variance of one was used as an environmental parameter for macro-environmental sensitivity. The “macro–micro”  “macro”  “micro” and “simple” models were all run for 50 ASReml runs. After 50 runs  the change in variance components was less than 0.2% of the change between consecutive runs and therefore parameters were considered converged. Estimated genetic variances were close to their true values when simulated genetic correlations were zero  although occasionally the average value deviated slightly from the true value (Table ). The average of the estimated genetic variance in slope was biased upwards in all cases  but the bias was small (between +2 and +13%). Surprisingly  standard deviations of relative to were small (between 21 and 30% of). Note that standard deviations across replicates represent standard errors of estimates from a single replicate  e.g. an analysis of one data set. The average of the estimated genetic variance in environmental variance had on average larger deviations from the true value but no direction in bias could be detected. Standard deviations of relative to were large (between 31 and 74%)  indicating that this parameter had a low precision. In the presence of fixed effects (i.e. contemporary group) for the mean and residual variance  standard deviations of estimated parameters increased on average by 9% and the number of replicates for which the genetic variance-covariance structure was forced to be positive definite also increased. Thus  the conclusion is that estimates of genetic variances are practically unbiased but that the precision of is low. In general  estimates of genetic variances remained close to their true values when genetic correlations were varied (<10% difference from the true value) (Table ). When all genetic correlations were equal to 0.5  the genetic variance of environmental variance was slightly underestimated (-11%). Estimates of genetic correlations were unbiased but had very high standard deviations  especially the genetic correlation between the breeding value for slope and environmental variance (). The number of replicates in which the variance-covariance structure was forced to be positive definite was in general small but slightly higher when all genetic correlations were equal to 0.5. In addition to the results shown  we simulated an extreme negative genetic correlation ()  as well as an extreme positive genetic correlation (). In these scenarios  for 40 to 60% of the replicates  the variance-covariance matrix was bended to be positive definite. Due to the large proportion of replicates with bended variance-covariance matrices  the average genetic correlation was biased towards zero. Nevertheless  the general conclusion is that estimates of genetic correlations are largely unbiased but are estimated with low precision. When varying the number of offspring per sire or the number of sire families  means of genetic variances were close to their true simulated values in most cases  except when the number of offspring per sire was 20 for which estimates for and were biased upwards (25% and 20%  respectively) (Table ). In this case  51% of the replicates had variance-covariance matrices that were forced to be positive definite  indicating that this is not a suitable design to estimate genetic parameters for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities. When increasing the number of offspring per sire  the standard deviations of estimates of and decreased substantially  e.g. from 50 to 200 offspring with 54 and 60%  respectively  whereas the standard deviation of estimates of decreased only slightly (-10%). When increasing the number of sire families from 50 to 200  standard deviations of estimates of all genetic parameters decreased substantially (from -52 to -58%). Based on these results  we conclude that designs with at least 100 sires with 100 offspring each are required in order to estimate variance components for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities with low standard errors. Using AIC to select the best fitting model  the true genetic model was selected as the best statistical model in at least 90% of the 100 replicates when the number of offspring per sire was 100 (Table ). In only a few cases did the best statistical model differ from the true genetic model. However  when the number of offspring per sire was 50  the correct model was selected for 63% to 95% of the replicates. When both macro- and micro-environmental sensitivity existed and the number of offspring per sire was 50  the macro model was selected rather than the macro–micro model in 27% of the replicates. When only micro-environmental sensitivity existed and 50 offspring per sire  the power to select the correct model was reduced. In conclusion  the power to select the correct model was high in designs with at least 100 offspring per sire. It is of interest to determine whether genetic parameters are biased if the wrong statistical model is applied. When either macro or micro-environmental sensitivity was simulated (Table )  the variance-covariance structures were forced to be positive definite in many replicates  due to estimates of variances at the boundary. Estimates at the boundary were expected since the estimated genetic variance should be close to zero when the true genetic variance is zero. Forcing the genetic variance-covariance structures to be positive definite can bias estimates of parameters. When true macro-environmental sensitivity existed  some micro-environmental sensitivity was detected () with the “micro” (scenario A) and the “macro–micro” (scenario B) models  indicating that part of the macro-environmental sensitivity was captured as micro-environmental sensitivity  but were small (0.010-0.018). When true micro-environmental sensitivity existed  no macro-environmental sensitivity was detected () with the “macro” (scenario C) and “macro–micro” (scenario D) models  but were biased downwards (between -16% to -28%)  possibly because of the high number of genetic variance-covariance structures that were forced to be positive definite. When both macro and micro-environmental sensitivity existed  the “macro” (scenario E) and “micro” (scenario F) models gave unbiased estimates of either macro-environmental sensitivity or micro-environmental sensitivity and the genetic variance-covariance structure was forced to be positive definite for at maximum three replicates. Thus  the general conclusion is that a discrepancy between the true and statistical models does not lead to large biases in estimated genetic parameters and that contamination between estimates of the two types of environmental sensitivity is very limited. The “macro–micro”  “macro”  “micro” and “simple” models were applied to 305-day first lactation milk yield data of Swedish Holsteins (mean = 8693 kg  standard deviation = 1652 kg  skew = 0.18  kurtosis = 0.28). “Macro”  “micro” and “macro–micro” models fitted significantly better than the “simple” model. The “micro” model was favoured by AIC (Table ) and had the best fit. The genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity was substantial but lower than for most reported traits[]: one genetic standard deviation changed micro-environmental sensitivity (= environmental variance) by 21%. The difference in AIC between the “macro–micro” and “micro” models was small and therefore it was interesting to examine the genetic parameters of the “macro–micro” model. The estimated genetic variance for macro-environmental sensitivity was small in comparison to the genetic variance in intercept. For instance  the estimate of the genetic correlation between environments that were -2 and 2 standard deviations from the overall mean was 0.92  indicating a small level of reranking of sires across the environmental gradient. Estimates of genetic correlations between intercept and macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities were 0.81 and 0.63  respectively  indicating that selection for higher milk yield increases both types of environmental sensitivity. The estimate of the genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities was 0.76  indicating that they are genetically similar. Standard errors of parameter estimates were smaller than the standard deviations found for the simulations  due to the larger dataset i.e. more sires and more offspring per sire. Thus  macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities may exist for milk yield in dairy cattle and are positively correlated. In this study  we developed a model to estimate genetic variances for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities. The model is an extension of the DHGLM as presented by Rönnegård et al.[]. Here  we combined a linear reaction norm model to estimate genetic variance for macro-environmental sensitivity with the DHGLM to estimate genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity. The animal model in Equation () was adapted to a sire model because the animal model produced highly biased estimated variance components because of the high dependence of the estimated breeding values and residuals on the variance ratio used in the mixed model equations  which would differ for each animal. Felleki et al.[] also reported the presence of bias in variance components with few repeated observations per animal but the bias decreased as the number of repeated observations per animal increased. Furthermore  an animal model with heterogeneous residual variance (DHGLM implementation) gave a poorer adjusted profile h-likelihood than an animal model without homogenous residual variance  which indicates that the former did not produce a better fit than the latter in a scenario that included both macro and micro-environmental sensitivities. Therefore  we decided to use a sire model implementation  because it is more robust than the animal model implementation with DHGLM when animals only have a single observation. Furthermore  sire models are commonly used for reaction norm models  because of their substantially lower computational burden compared to animal models and genetic information about environmental sensitivity typically comes from paternal half-sibs that perform in different environments. As far as we know  this is the first time that a model to estimate genetic variance in macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities suitable for outbred animal populations is presented. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate bias and precision of estimated genetic parameters. Genetic parameters were unbiased in most situations. The precision was not very high  especially of estimates for  as indicated by the high standard deviation of estimates across replicates  particularly in designs with small families. Designs with at least 100 sire families  each with at least 100 offspring  are required to have sufficient precision. Presence of fixed effects  such as contemporary group effects  would increase the required number of sire families and the number of offspring per sire family. These results are in agreement with standard error and power calculations reported by Hill[]  Mulder[] and Hill and Mulder[] with respect to estimation of genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity or for environmental variance. For instance  Hill and Mulder[] derived that the optimal family size to estimate genetic variance for environmental variance with a family design is approximately 2/  where  is the square of the coefficient of variation of the within-family variance. Thus  the optimal family size for half-sibs is 137 when. The only study providing Monte Carlo results for the DHGLM to estimate genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity is by Rönnegård et al.[]. They considered a design with clones  which is more powerful and leads to lower standard deviations of estimates than those in our study. With respect to macro-environmental sensitivity  the magnitude of the standard deviations of the estimates across replicates was similar to that reported by Calus et al.[]  but larger than those reported by Lillehammer et al.[]  which is explained by the fact that the latter authors simulated more sire families  i.e.  1000 sire families with 100 offspring each. In general  the number of required offspring per family is lower for macro-environmental sensitivity than for micro-environmental sensitivity  as indicated by the lower standard deviations of estimates of genetic variance for the former. This is in agreement with a previous study by Mulder[]  which showed that the power to detect G x E interactions between two environments is greater than the power to detect genetic variance for environmental variance or micro-environmental sensitivity. In the present study  we assumed that the environmental parameter  used for the reaction norm was known without error. This will be true in some cases  e.g. when using temperature or rainfall or other herd characteristics[]. In other cases  an estimated herd mean is used as the environmental parameter  which is estimated from the data[    ]. Calus et al.[] showed that genetic variance in macro-environmental sensitivity () was severely underestimated when the environmental parameter was estimated from the data. This may have also led to the genetic variance in macro-environmental sensitivity to be underestimated in our application to milk yield. Su et al.[] reported that a Bayesian approach that estimates simultaneously the herd mean and the reaction norm parameters leads to unbiased estimates of. Lillehammer et al.[] showed that sire models gave upward biased estimates of when heterogeneity of residual variance was ignored  because the unexplained genetic variance in the reaction norm parameters becomes part of the residual variance when using a sire model. In our study  the bias in estimates of was smaller than in Lillehammer et al.[]. Lillehammer et al.[] proposed including a dummy animal effect in the model to account for the residual three-quarters of the genetic variance that is not accounted for by the sire effect. This solution was also tested in our model but gave severely biased variance components because of the high dependency of estimated breeding values and residuals on variance ratios that were used in the mixed model equations  which differ by animal when considering heterogeneity of residual variance. The algorithm developed in this study allowed estimating genetic correlations between the different genetic effects. Standard deviations of estimated genetic correlations were large  especially those of the genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities (). This large magnitude of the standard deviation of estimates of the genetic correlation was expected considering that the genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities is mainly based on paternal half-sib information and that both traits have low heritability. Using the equation in Robertson[] and assuming a heritability of 0.05 for both traits  the standard error is approximately 0.26 when the true genetic correlation between the traits is zero  which is close to the value found here  i.e. 0.25 (Table ). To increase the precision of estimates of the genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities  designs with a larger number of families and larger family sizes are required. The application to milk yield data in dairy cattle shows that it should be possible to estimate genetic correlations with standard errors between 0.06 and 0.10  since in most countries datasets with at least 100 bulls each with 100 daughters are easily obtained. Full-sib families or clones would also reduce standard errors of estimates of genetic correlations in comparison to half-sibs. Here  we showed that the adjusted profile h-likelihood (APHL) can be approximated from REML-output and used in combination with AIC to provide an efficient model selection tool. In addition  we showed that biases in genetic parameters were relatively small when statistical and true models differed. Both results are re-assuring that these models can discriminate between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities and that the true model of environmental sensitivity can be elucidated using AIC. We also found that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was too conservative and favoured the simpler model too often (results not shown). AIC has the advantage that it can be used independent of the order of the fitted models  whereas the likelihood ratio test requires a hierarchical structure such as in a forward selection scheme[]. The proposed model can contribute to better understand the genetic architecture of environmental sensitivity  e.g. whether macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities are genetically related. Most studies in plants and laboratory species indicate that macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities are weakly correlated[–  –]. This seems to indicate that selection on one type of environmental sensitivity will hardly affect the other. The first application of the model on milk yield data in dairy cattle  revealed a high genetic correlation between macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities (0.76)  suggesting that selection on one type of environmental sensitivity will also affect the other in the same direction. Generally  little is known about these relationships in livestock. Knowledge about these genetic correlations could be used to optimize selection strategies for environmental sensitivity. In this study  we assumed a linear reaction norm model  but reaction norms can also be non-linear[]. The model presented here can easily be extended to higher-order polynomials. Furthermore  the genetic basis of micro-environmental sensitivity may not be the same along an environmental gradient and the model for residual variance or micro-environmental sensitivity in Equation () could be extended to contain a reaction norm with a known environmental gradient. For instance  in stressful environments  there might be more genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity than in less stressful environments. Furthermore  G × E interactions often exist between categorical environments and are often analysed with character state or multivariate models[]. Character state models do not explicitly estimate breeding values for macro-environmental sensitivity  but these breeding values could be back-calculated by using covariance functions when the environmental parameter responsible for G × E interactions is identified because reaction norm models and character state models are interchangeable[]. In the case of two environments  a reaction norm model with a dummy environmental parameter with values 0 and 1 would yield results that are identical to a bivariate character state model. Multivariate versions of the DHGLM or reaction norm models with dummy environmental variables could be used to simultaneously investigate macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities when environments are discrete. Taking macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities into consideration is highly relevant in animal breeding. Due to the high level of globalisation in animal breeding programs  it is necessary to breed animals that can perform well in a wide range of environments. Therefore  it may be important to select animals that have limited environmental sensitivity  especially for environments with a higher risk of environmental disturbances. Reduction in environmental sensitivity increases the predictability of performance and reduces risk for farmers[]. Furthermore  reduction in micro-environmental sensitivity will increase the uniformity of animal products[]  which is a general goal. In plant breeding  application of a model for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities is also highly relevant since G × E interactions are generally very strong and uniformity of crops is very important. Recent papers by Ordas et al.[]  Makumburage and Stapleton[] and Kliebenstein[] show that there is an interest for increased uniformity in plants. Economic values could be derived for micro-environmental sensitivity[]. The economic value of macro-environmental sensitivity can be determined as a function of the importance of environments along the environmental gradient. Based on Mulder et al.[  ]  progeny testing schemes are more efficient than sib testing schemes to reduce micro-environmental sensitivity since it behaves as a trait with a small heritability. Genomic selection could be an alternative selection strategy with sufficient accuracy and shorter generation intervals. In this study  a model was developed to estimate genetic parameters of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities  combining a reaction norm model with a double hierarchical generalized linear model within a REML framework. Simulations showed that the genetic parameters obtained were mostly unbiased  but designs with at least 100 sires  each with 100 half-sib offspring  were required to estimate genetic parameters with sufficient precision. Using AIC  the true genetic model was selected as the best statistical model in at least 90% of replicates when the number of offspring per sire was 100. Application of the model to milk yield data in dairy cattle showed that both types of environmental sensitivity existed. Our model and AIC based on h-likelihood can be used to increase our understanding of the genetic control of environmental sensitivity in livestock populations but more research is needed to test the model in a wider range of situations. The original DHGLM algorithm of Rönnegård et al.[] was developed for an animal model. Here we describe the estimation algorithm for the sire model used in the current paper  including a few adjustments of the algorithm in Rönnegård et al.[] to correct for the fact that the residual variance in a sire model (without permanent environmental effects  e.g. with animals with a single observation) contains three quarters of the additive genetic variance in addition to the environmental variance. The adjustments in the algorithm are as follows: adjustment of the squared residuals () accounting for the fact that the residual variance in a sire model includes three quarters of the additive genetic variance  use of average residual variance to calculate  (instead of predicted individual values)  and computations of the diagonal weight matrices  and . These adjustments resulted in a computationally robust algorithm with small or no bias (as presented in Results). To compute the linearized response  for the bivariate sire model in Equation ()  first we calculate as: This is equivalent to the calculations for the response  in[]  except for the multiplication by the ratio of the average estimated residual variance in a sire model (  whereand  is the total number of records) and the average residual variance in an animal model  which is calculated as  (). Because we use a log link function  is linearized as: The diagonals of  are the reciprocals of (i.e.)  which is the vector of predicted residual variances for each observation based on the previous iteration and is calculated as: The sire effects for environmental variance only affect the part of the residual variance which is truly environmental variance and therefore three-quarters of the additive genetic variance is subtracted in the multiplicative part of Equation (). The diagonals of  are the reciprocals of the residual variance of  and were calculated as: This is motivated by the fact that by combining Equations () and ()  and by assuming that the estimated residuals are close to the true ones  we have: since the true residuals are assumed normal and the squared true residuals are therefore Gamma distributed with a variance of. The algorithm can be summarized as: Run model on  in Equation () with homogeneous residual variance. Calculate          where  in iteration 1. Run bivariate model in Equation (). Update         Iterate steps 3 till 4 until convergence                                      In our paper  the model selection was based on an approximation of the adjusted profile h-likelihood (APHL)  which is defined as[]: where  is the Hessian of the h-likelihood and  is the vector of all fixed and random effects both in the mean and variance parts of the model. For the model in Equation ()  minus two times the h-likelihood (-<U+2009>2) is: where  is log-likelihood  (  with being the  diagonal of ) is the residual variance of observation   is the estimated squared residual of observation   is the covariance matrix of all random effects ()   is a vector of all random sire effects () and is the weight for the mean model for observation . The minus two log REML likelihood () from the bivariate model in Equation () is: where the first  residual variances come from the first part of the bivariate model () and the next  residual variances come from the second part of the bivariate model () ( =  = number of records)  and  is the Hessian of the bivariate model (i.e. left-hand-side of the mixed model equations). Because log (det()) is a reasonable approximation of log (det ())[]  we can approximate  as given in Equation () in the main text: Thus  the REML likelihood for the bivariate model is corrected for the fact that the squared residuals are used as “observations” in the bivariate model. Note that equation () can also be used for animal models by replacing the elements and with the corresponding elements of Equation () or for models with more or fewer random effects in the mean and variance model.

They are fat-type pigs and have a rare curly hair phenotype. The aim of our study was to establish the relationships between these unique breeds and other European breeds.ResultsBased on a core sequence of 382 bp present in 2713 mitochondrial D-loop sequences from pigs belonging to 38 local breeds from nine countries  five cosmopolitan breeds and wild boars from 14 countries  we identified 164 haplotypes. More than half of the 2713 sequences belonged to either four haplotypes characteristic of continental European breeds or two haplotypes characteristic of British/cosmopolitan breeds; each haplotype is present in more than 100 individuals. Most Mangalica individuals belonged either to one of these common continental European haplotypes or to two Mangalica-specific haplotypes that were absent in all other breeds. In addition  we identified the ancestral mitochondrial D-loop signature present in these 2713 sequences and found that ~ 80% carried the European ancient signatures  ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside or their closely related signatures  while most of the remaining sequences carried a modern Asian signature  ANC-Easia. Mangalica individuals carried the ANC-Aside signature  but not the ANC-Cside or ANC-Easia signatures.ConclusionsIn all the Mangalica individuals  a unique ancient European signature was found in the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region  but they belonged almost exclusively to either certain very abundant European or two Mangalica-specific D-loop haplotypes.

In all the Mangalica individuals  a unique ancient European signature was found in the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region  but they belonged almost exclusively to either certain very abundant European or two Mangalica-specific D-loop haplotypes. This indicates that the present-day Mangalica population in Hungary evolved either by introgression of other European breeds and wild boars or via total isolation after the divergence of European ancient porcine bloodlines. There are hundreds of modern pig breeds and many of these are local breeds whereas only a few cosmopolitan breeds are used in the meat industry []. The three Mangalica breeds  Blond  Red and Swallow-belly [] are local  fat-type breeds with characteristic curly hair. They are farmed in Hungary  other successor states of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and several other countries  and represent a niche pork market. The history of the Mangalica breeds dates back to the late 1700s when both spontaneous and conscious breeding started. Such breeding involved two old Mediterranean pig breeds  Sumadia and Syrmian that originated from the current territories of Serbia and Croatia  and three of the eight old pig breeds that were described in historical Hungary [  ] i.e. Bakonyi  Szalontai and Alföldi. To date  knowledge on the reproductive biology of the Mangalica breeds is quite extensive [–]  while their genetics is less studied []. Although a number of studies have been conducted to examine the diversity  relationship and introgression between European pigs [–]  Mangalica breeds have not been examined in this context. Here  we describe a large-scale comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop sequences of Mangalica and other European pig breeds in order to determine the molecular relationships between these breeds and their historical roots. For this purpose  mtDNA D-loop sequences of 195 Mangalica individuals from a previous study [] and 2518 additional sequences from the NCBI Genbank [see Additional file  and references therein] were combined. The collection covered wild boars from 14 countries  five cosmopolitan breeds  38 local breeds from nine countries  and eight Mangalica pigs from an unspecified breed [see Additional file ]. Haplotypes were determined using a 382 bp core sequence shared by all sequences [see Additional file ]. Within this core sequence  97 polymorphic positions were identified i.e. 52 transitions  23 transversions  eight deletions  seven insertions and seven multiple variations  which resulted in 164 haplotypes [see Additional file ]. Six major haplotypes  each one observed in more than 100 individuals  were identified i.e. HAP07  HAP08  HAP09  HAP13  HAP56 and HAP57. Haplotypes HAP07 and HAP08 correspond to the core European haplotypes C and A  respectively  as described previously [  ]. In terms of number of individuals  HAP08 was the most abundant haplotype (18.8%)  followed by HAP09 (10.4%)  HAP07 (9.1%)  HAP13 (6.7%)  HAP56 (5.6%) and HAP57 (4.3%) and each of these haplotypes was found in 33  24  27  23  15 and eight breeds and wild boar populations  respectively [see Additional file ]. Among the 195 Mangalica individuals from our previous study []  56 belonged to the two major European haplotypes  HAP08 and HAP13  91 to the Mangalica-specific haplotypes HAP15 and HAP16  37 to haplotypes HAP44 and HAP45 and 11 to seven of the minor haplotypes. The eight Mangalica individuals without breed specification collected from another study [see Additional file ] also belonged to haplotypes HAP08 and HAP13. Taking into consideration that Mangalica pigs separate into three breeds  i.e. Blond  Red and Swallow-belly  it is interesting to note that haplotypes HAP08  HAP15 and HAP45 were present in individuals of all three breeds  while no Red individual carried haplotypes HAP13 and HAP16  and no Swallow-belly individual carried HAP44. Red and Blond Mangalica breeds shared haplotype HAP44 with individuals from the Duroc  Large White and Tamworth breeds  and all three Mangalica breeds shared haplotype HAP45 with Austrian wild boars. Interestingly  the Mangalica breeds had no haplotype in common with the Hungarian wild boars. In this study  individuals associated with haplotypes HAP15 and HAP16 were found only in the Mangalica breeds. Thus  they probably represent Mangalica-specific maternal lineages. We computed the F and Nei’s genetic distance indices for breeds for which mtDNA D-loop sequences were available for ten or more individuals. The results revealed that the within-breed diversity of the Mangalica breeds was similar to that of local Spanish and Italian breeds and that the Mangalica breeds were more homogeneous than the cosmopolitan and British local breeds and certain South-European wild boars (Figure ). The Swallow-belly and Blond Mangalica breeds were genetically closer to each other  than to the Red Mangalica breed as shown by the pair-wise F and Nei’s distance values (Table ). The Red Mangalica breed was genetically closer to continental European breeds and wild boars than the Blond and Swallow-belly Mangalica breeds (Table ). With the exception of the comparison between the German wild boar population and the Red Mangalica breed  all F and Nei’s pair-wise distance values were significant  at the  = 0.05 level  between any one of the three Mangalica breeds and any other breed involved in this study (data not shown).  Values over the bars indicate “average number of pair-wise differences within populations” values; breeds and wild boar populations of different geographical origin are shown by different colours: brown = Western-Europe wild boars  yellow = Western-Europe local pigs  light blue = Southern-Europe wild boars  dark blue = Southern-Europe local pigs  magenta = Central-Europe wild boars  red = cosmopolitan breeds and green = Mangalica breeds. An analysis on 208 European archaeological pig specimens identified five mtDNA D-loop signatures: ANC-Aside  ANC-Cside  ANC-Italy  ANC-Y1-6A and ANC-Y2-5A []. Of these 208 samples  109 (52.4%) carried ANC-Aside and 65 (31.25%) ANC-Cside  while the remaining 34 samples (16.35%) had one of the other three signatures. In a previous study  we showed that 197 (97%) of the 203 Mangalica individuals analysed (all included in the haplotype analysis described here) also carry the ANC-Aside signature  while the remaining six individuals carry signatures that are phylogenetically very close to ANC-Aside []. To compare other European breeds with the Mangalica breeds and to determine the relationships to their ancestors  we identified the ancient signature of the remaining 2518 individuals of our current study and found that the ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside signatures were present in modern pigs at frequencies (42.5% and 33.5%  respectively) similar to those in the ancient pig specimens. In contrast  the frequency of the ANC-Italy  ANC-Y1-6A  and ANC-Y2-5A signatures dropped to less than 1.0% each. We note here that the ANC-Easia signature  which was not found in the European archaeological specimens []  was observed in 455 of the 2713 modern pigs that we analysed. This is due  in part  to the introgression of Asian pig breeds into cosmopolitan and local British breeds  since 92.1% of the individuals with the ANC-Easia signature belong to these breeds. Our analysis revealed that individuals that carried the major European haplotypes HAP07 or HAP09  HAP08 or HAP13 and HAP56 or HAP57 also carried ANC-Cside  ANC-Aside or ANC-Easia signatures  respectively [see Additional file ]. It is important to note  that both the ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside signatures were present in several breeds and wild boar populations and consequently they can be characterised by more than one haplotype. While Mangalica breeds can belong to several haplotypes  almost 50% of the breeds analyzed displayed only two haplotypes  HAP15 and HAP16  which were not present in any of the other breeds and wild boars studied. Furthermore  all 203 Mangalica individuals in this study carried the ANC-Aside signature. Both the ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside signatures and the haplotypes HAP08 and HAP07 that carry them differ by one nucleotide substitution. Due to the difference between the lengths of the signature and the haplotype sequences [see Additional file ]  the calculated divergence time between ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside signatures  and between HAP08 and HAP07 is ~98 000 and ~190 000 YBP  respectively. This in good agreement with previously reported results [  ] and clearly indicates that the time of divergence between the European porcine maternal lineages carrying the ANC-Aside and ANC-Cside signatures is much older than the age of the oldest European archaeological specimen [] and the predicted time of wild boar domestication []. There are several possible explanations for the unique signature/haplotype characteristics of the Mangalica breeds. One hypothesis is that ancestors of the current Mangalica population in Hungary that carried the ANC-Aside signature and of the European wild boar populations that carried the ANC-Cside signature became geographically isolated during prehistoric times. Another possibility is that the ANC-Aside signature evolved from the ANC-Cside signature in the Mangalica ancestor species after isolation. It cannot be excluded that either the population bottleneck that occurred in the Mangalica population during the 1960’s [] or breeding practices selected against the ANC-Cside signature if present in the Mangalica population. However  given the presence of Mangalica-specific haplotypes  the isolation theory is the most likely. The network of haplotypes (Figure ) suggests that the breed-specific haplotypes HAP16 and HAP15 evolved from HAP45 by one nucleotide substitution and from either HAP13 or HAP16 by two nucleotide substitutions  respectively. Consequently  the time of divergence between these haplotypes and of their possible isolation dates back to ~190 000 and ~380 000 YBP. The disappearance of Western- and Southern-European and Austrian wild boars and parallel evolution of HAP45 to HAP16 and HAP13 to HAP15  suggest that isolation might have occurred by a west-to-east migration of Mangalica ancestor species. This is also supported by the fact that certain Mangalica individuals and Austrian wild boars share haplotype HAP45.

In summary  we conclude that the present-day Mangalica population in Hungary may have originated by two different mechanisms: either introgression of common European bloodlines into the Mangalica breeds or by total isolation of some Mangalica ancestor species  as suggested by the presence of both common European and Mangalica-specific mtDNA D-loop haplotypes in the population.

To date  more than 17 species or strains have been farmed for fillets and caviar production. Crossbreeding among different sturgeon species is frequent and the F2 hybrids are fertile. However  large-scale farming can have negative impacts on wild populations i.e. escape of exotic sturgeons and must be taken into consideration.

However  little is known about their genetic resources and variation.MethodsGenetic diversity and introgression of seven sturgeon species were analyzed using mitochondrial DNA  () and nine microsatellite markers. This study included 189 individuals from seven sturgeon species and 277 individuals from ten lineages of F2 hybrid strains.ResultsMtDNA  sequences (632 bp long) were generated from 91 individuals across the 17 sturgeon strains and produced 23 different haplotypes.

Moreover  we found that introgressive hybridization is pervasive  exists in both purebred and hybrid sturgeons  and may reflect widespread mismanagement in sturgeon breeding in China. Hybridization is probably an inevitable process during speciation []  in which offspring inherit restructured parental genes obtained by mating individuals of different genotypes. Hybridization is common both in plants and animals [–]  and is largely exploited to improve various species [–]  especially plants [  ]. Through hybridization  desirable traits can be combined  leading to more competitive descendants and heterosis. Much research has been performed to evaluate crossbreeding in farm animals [–]. Crossbreeding is fast and effective  creates heterosis in the future generations [  ] and can contribute to genetic improvement []. Sturgeon is one of the most ancient fish in the world and belongs to the order Acipenseriformes that contains 27 species divided into two families i.e.  (sturgeon  25 species) and  (paddlefish  two species). Most sturgeon species are near extinction []  and have been listed in the Appendices to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) at the 10 meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP10) since 1997. Today  sturgeons are considered worldwide as excellent candidates for aquaculture due to their high commercial value (caviar production and meat). Conflicting issues between the drastic reduction in natural populations and the huge profits in the business of sturgeon farming are the main driving force promoting the development of sturgeon aquaculture in China []. Recently  with the development of sturgeon aquaculture and the increase in cultured broodstock  China has become the largest sturgeon aquaculture country in the world  and hybrid sturgeons are widely bred []. The most recent survey has recorded more than 17 sturgeon strains (including both purebreds and hybrids) aquacultured in China  with two species i.e.  and .   and three hybrid sturgeon strains i.e. .  × .   .  ×   and .  × .  dominating sturgeon farming []. Among the hybrid sturgeon lines  some grow slowly and are of low quality value  but it is difficult to identify hybrid strains of sturgeon  especially at the early stages of growth i.e. fry and sub-adults. In addition  little is known on the genetics and polymorphism of sturgeons. In recent years  progress in artificial propagation technology has expedited the development of sturgeon aquaculture. However  when selective breeding is performed  the genetic relationships between candidate parents are unknown  resulting in random hybridization of different sturgeons. To prevent both inbreeding and degradation of germplasm resources  it is necessary to analyze the genetic background of the candidate breeders. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite genetic markers have been used successfully in the studies of fish for introgressive hybridization [–]. In this study  we used nine microsatellites and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene  to examine the genetic diversity  introgression  and differences in genetic background of 17 farmed sturgeon strains  including seven species and ten hybrids. From 2008 to 2011  seven sturgeon species and ten hybrids were obtained from the Engineering and Technology Center of Sturgeon Breeding and Cultivation of Chinese Academy of Fishery Science (Beijing  China)  the Heilongjiang Fisheries Research Institute  the Beijing Fisheries Research Institute  and the Hangzhou Qiandaohu Xunlong Sci-Tech Co.  Ltd. (Table ). The historical background of all the sturgeons collected was known  and each species was identified according to anatomical characteristics. Fish fins were stored in 95% ethanol. Genomic DNA was prepared using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). The mtDNA gene  (632 bp) was amplified for five to eight individuals of each sturgeon strain (total n = 91) using published primers that were designed specifically for fish i.e. (FishF1 [5'-TCAACCAACCACAAAGACATTGGCAC-3'] and FishR1 [5'-TAGACTTCTGGG TGGCCA AAGAATCA-3']) []. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplifications were carried out in 25 µL reaction volumes containing approximately 20 ng of template DNA  1 µL of each primer  9.5 µL of ddHO  and 12.5 µL of 2x Premix Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). Amplification conditions were as follows: 95°C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s  57°C for 30 s  and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Positive (with DNA template) and negative (with water) controls were used to check PCR performance and contamination. The PCR products were purified using the PCR purification kit (Shanghai Bio-Tec  Ltd) and sequenced with the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and run on an ABI 377 genetic analyzer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To avoid errors in sequencing  PCR amplifications of all samples were sequenced on both strands. Fifteen microsatellite loci were selected before the start of the experiment  the amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on 10% (29/1 Acrylamide-bisacrylamide) 0.50 mm thick denaturing polyacrylamide gels (120 V  10 h)  and DNA bands were visualized using silver staining. The size of individual alleles was determined using a 50 bp DNA size standard (Tiangen) and allele sizes were estimated by Gelpro 3.2. Nine of 15 most effective loci were selected for further analyses after the preliminary analysis [See Additional file : Table S1] [  ]. The corresponding nine primer pairs were fluorescently labeled with one of the following dyes FAM  HEX  or TAMRA. PCR was performed under the following conditions: preheating at 94°C for 4 min; denaturing at 94°C for 40 s  annealing at 50-58°C for 30 s  and elongation at 72°C for 40 s for 35 cycles; extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplifications were carried out in 15 µL reaction volumes containing 10 ng of template DNA  0.5 µL of each primer  6 µL of ddHO  and 7.5 µL of 2x Premix Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). All PCR were carried out in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research). Allele sizing was carried out by automated fluorescent scanning detection in an ABI 377XL DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using ROX500 as internal lane size standard  and the software GENESCAN and GENOTYPER (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences were aligned using the CLUSTALX software (1.83) and checked by eye. Variable nucleotide sites (including transversions (tv)  transitions (ts) and insertions/deletions) were calculated using MEGA 2.1 software. Haplotypes were estimated using DNASP  and the haplotype network was drawn using NETWORK software. For the phylogenetic analysis  Modeltest 3.06 was run to determine the appropriate model of molecular evolution in a likelihood ratio test framework. We then performed maximum-parsimony (MP) analysis using the programs PAUP 4.0 and MRBAYES 3.0  with  as out-group. Gaps were treated as missing in the parsimony analyses. Bootstrap analyses were performed with 6000 replicates and 1000 full heuristic replicates for maximum parsimony. For Bayesian phylogenetic inference  four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were run for 1 500 000 generations  sampling every 1000 generations. The initial 5% of trees were discarded as burn-in  and finally  a 50% majority rule consensus tree was constructed. Specific nucleotide sites were analyzed in the  sequences  and haplotype distributions  nucleotide diversities (p) within and among strains were estimated using DNASP. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed to compare the levels of genetic diversity within and among several possible strain groups using Arlequin 3.11 with 1023 permutations. Individual polyploidy genotypes were scored from microsatellite banding patterns in the electropherograms according to the Microsatellite DNA Allele Counting-Peak Ratios (MAC-PR) method of Esselink et al.(2004) []. The STRUCTURE version 2.3.2 program [] was used to infer strain composition based on microsatellite data. We used the Bayesian clustering approach in STRUCTURE 2.0 to identify the most likely number of clusters (K) as well as to assign individuals to these clusters. We performed five replicate runs (burn-in period of 1 000 000 steps and 120 000 MCMC iterations) at each value of K from 2 to 7. Individuals were assigned on the basis of their membership coefficient and factor correlation analysis (FCA) based on the multilocus genotypes was carried out using the GENETIX program to separate the strains and identify any intermediate genotypes resulting from admixture of strains []. We used the POLYSAT software to calculate the number of alleles  allele frequency  and Shannon-Wiener index. The Simpson index was used to characterize the levels of genetic diversity in each sturgeon strain []. MtDNA  sequences (632 bp) were generated from 17 strains represented by 91 individuals. One hundred and six variable nucleotide sites were found  including 14 transversions (tv)  82 transitions (ts) and 10 insertions/deletions  and 23 haplotypes were defined [GenBank accession numbers: KC578823-KC578845]. Our results revealed high haplotype diversity (h = 0.915 ± 0.015) and low nucleotide diversity (p = 0.03680 ± 0.00153) in the seven sturgeon species and ten interspecific hybrids. The seven pure sturgeon species harbored unique nucleotide sites: .  (Xi) had the greatest number of specific nucleotide sites (i.e. 14)  while .  (X) and .  (E) had the lowest number (i.e. 1) [See Additional file : Table S2]. H09 was the most common haplotype shared by 19 individuals and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XiH) had the biggest number of haplotypes (Table ). Using MODELTEST  the HKY+G model was built using the best fitting distance estimator. It showed a gamma distribution shape parameter of 0.2655  a transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio of 4.0901  and base frequencies of A = 0.2650  C = 0.2825  G = 0.1780 and T = 0.2744. Parsimony analyses were performed under equal weight (Ti/Vi = 1) and unequal weight (Ti/Vi = 4.0901) sets. All phylogenetic analyses resulted in almost identical tree topologies. With the exception of all individuals from . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XE) and one individual from . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XiH)  most of the tree topologies were grouped together with the same matrilineal sturgeon [See Additional file : Figure S1]. This observation was supported by haplotype network analysis (Figure ).    Each circle represents a single haplotype; circle size is scaled by haplotype frequency; the same colors indicate the same matrilineal sturgeon; 1: .   . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 2: .   . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>  . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 3: .  and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 4: .   . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>  . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 5: .  and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 6: .  and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>; 7: . . AMOVA analysis revealed that 81.73% of the genetic variance was due to matrilineal differences and 9.40% to strain variation  while only 8.86% of the genetic variance originated from strains within groups with the same matrilineal sturgeon (Table ). A total of 466 individual sturgeons (Table ) were genotyped using nine nuclear microsatellite markers [See Additional file : Table S3]. All tested microsatellite loci were polymorphic in all farmed sturgeons. Microsatellite LS68 had the biggest number of alleles per individual  while LS19 had the smallest. . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (ZS) tended to have more alleles per individual per locus  while . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>(XH) had the fewest [See Additional file : Table S4]. Using POLYSAT software  we showed that the total number of alleles observed at each locus ranged from 7 to 15  with a total of 386 alleles detected across the nine loci. The total number of alleles found within strains ranged from 42 (. <U+2640> × . <U+2642>) to 117 (. <U+2640> × . <U+2642>)  and the number of alleles per microsatellite ranged from 25 (LS54) to 71 (SPL106) [See Additional file : Table S3]. Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices were used as measures of allelic diversity and dominance in the population  respectively. Based on the microsatellite analysis  the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices of sturgeon alleles ranged from 1.561 to 3.404 and from 0 to 0.092  respectively (Figure ). - Factor correlation analysis (FCA) based on microsatellite genotypes revealed a clear segregation among purebred sturgeon species and hybrids. FCA highlighted the differences among the seven analyzed purebred species. The most informative is axis 1 (23.18% of the total genetic variation)  which separates the seven species and distinguishes .  (E) and .  (X) from the five other species. Axis 2  which is slightly less informative (15.54%)  separates .  (Xi)  .  (Z)  .  (S) and .  (G). Finally  axis 3 mainly separates .  (E) and .  (H) with 12.07% of the total genetic variation (Figure ). The ten hybrids  even with their typical mtDNA  haplotypes of female descent  are identified as hybrids  but occupy an intermediate position among the parents according to the multidimensional analysis of microsatellite genotyping data [See Additional file : Figure S2  Additional file : Figure S4  Additional file : Figure S5  Additional file : Figure S6  Additional file : Figure S7  Additional file : Figure S8 and Additional file : Figure S9).  ()  To investigate the existence of different genetic clusters in sturgeon breeds  the admixture model implemented by the STRUCTURE software was used to analyze separately the microsatellite genotyping data. The assignment test  which was conducted with STRUCTURE with K ranging from 2 to 7 and was based on nine microsatellites  separated the samples into seven distinct groups  congruent with the seven sturgeon species  and ten mixed-cluster groups representing the ten interspecific hybrid strains [See Additional file : Figure S3]. Various degrees of introgressive hybridization were also observed in all seven purebred sturgeons with .  showing the highest level. DNA barcoding is widely used for species determination because sequence divergences are generally much lower among individuals of a given species than among closely related species [–]. However  hybridization among species can cause taxonomic uncertainty. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited  any hybrid or subsequent generation will only have maternal mtDNA []. Jenneckens et al. (2000) reported that genetic contamination of .  with .  or .  hybrids occurred in the Volga River in Russia. Crosses and backcrosses of these species with native .  led to the loss of the morphological diagnostic .  features []. In our study  we also used nine microsatellite loci from nuclear DNA and mtDNA COI for sturgeon identification. Our data showed that mtDNA can identify purebred sturgeon species and the maternal origin of hybrids (Figure ) and [See Additional file : Figure S1] since each line harbors unique sites [See Additional file : Table S2]. The interspecific mtDNA gene tree constructed agreed with the expected taxonomic divisions  except for all individuals of . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XE) and one individual of . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XiH). . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XE) was grouped together with strains bred from the female parent .   perhaps because of sex-specific or nonreciprocal crossing. Moreover  .  may be a hybrid and may have been backcrossed many times with . . Hybridization may be involved in particular gender combinations in each species due to the maternal inheritance of mtDNA []. One individual of . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XiH)  identified within the wrong cluster  may be due to erroneous identification of the original specimen. In general  matrocliny and patrocliny with different combinations of dominant and recessive alleles of the genes determine the diagnostic characters. These clearly demonstrate how the hybrid individuals acquire varying degrees of similarity and differences from the parental species []. Taxonomic confusion as a result of interspecific hybridization does not seem to be a major issue and can be solved with genetic markers of matroclinous and patroclinous inheritance []. Mitochondrial DNA sequences are frequently transferred to the nucleus  giving rise to the so-called nuclear mtDNA sequences or NUMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) because of hybridization []. NUMT is not helpful for species identification because of its potential pseudogene status []. NUMT are common in plants and animals  but few NUMT are found in fish [  ]. In our results  since no evidence of significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found among any loci  we can avoid this negative factor of NUMT for random distribution of these loci. Microsatellite results can distinguish reciprocal crosses among different sturgeons [See Additional file : Figure S2  Additional file : Figure S4  Additional file : Figure S5  Additional file : Figure S6  Additional file : Figure S7  Additional file : Figure S8 and Additional file : Figure S9)  and a few samples were assigned to the ‘wrong’ congeneric species  which may represent introgressive hybridization. Microsatellite analysis reveals population structure and helps to explain past introgression of DNA among sturgeon species. Strong signatures are widely documented when comparing introgression of microsatellites with that of mtDNA [  ]. We found that introgressive hybridization is pervasive in either purebred or hybrid farmed sturgeons  which may reflect widespread mismanagement of sturgeon breeding in China. STRUCTURE results showed that introgressive hybridization in domestic varieties (.   .   and . ) is less serious than in varieties introduced to China from abroad (.   .   .   and . ). .  is the most obvious example of strain impurity with a high level of genetic information originating from another sturgeon [See Additional file : Figure S3]  which may be due to the fact that this species was frequently used as a parent in crosses. Our results also showed that .  was almost assimilated by .  and that .  had introgressed into the hybrid stains of .  as a parent  especially in . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> and . <U+2640> × . <U+2642>. Such sturgeon hybridization has also been reported between the endangered .  species and the exotic .  species in the Danube River and between .  and .  in the Irtysh River of Sinkiang [  ]. Campton reported that introgression can cause a more abundant species to genetically assimilate a rare species []. In China  it is easy for farmed sturgeons to escape to natural water systems where wild sturgeons live  and there are no behavioral or physiological barriers preventing interbreeding between the cultured and wild populations []. .  is distributed in the Yangtze River Basin  but recently  different types of sturgeons have been cultured along the tributaries  and escaped individuals have crossed with .   leading to its farraginous genotype. MtDNA results revealed high gene diversity and low nucleotide diversity in these farmed sturgeons. Results from AMOVA analysis for the 17 strains of sturgeon showed that most of the genetic variance was distributed among the different matrilineal strains. These conclusions were supported by our microsatellite results. Since Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices measure allelic gene diversity and dominance in the population  respectively  a high and homogeneous Shannon-Wiener index may indicate that hybrid regions could comprise a large number of multigenerational backcrossed hybrids that are indistinguishable from the parental species []  and that multigenerational backcrossed hybrids resemble the parental species with which they share most of their alleles []. . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (XiH) showed the highest Simpson index  which may be due to the fact that introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence []. Similarly  high levels of genetic diversity have been reported in lake sturgeons across the species’ range []. The low levels of genetic diversity in . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (ZS) suggest that . <U+2640> × . <U+2642> (ZS) was founded by a small number of individuals. Genetic diversity of farm animal is often exploited to meet current production needs  to allow sustained genetic improvement  and to facilitate rapid adaptation to changing breeding objectives []. Allele introgression is crucial to livestock genetics  while crossbreeding has always been a staple of breeding programs. Hybridization and polyploid formation will continue to generate species diversity . Our results show that farmed sturgeons hybridize with each other to varying degrees and with high genetic diversity. The conservation aquaculture programs are designed to minimize the genetic impacts on wild populations caused by introgressive farmed populations. We combined a morphological study with DNA barcoding and microsatellite markers to show that we can unambiguously identify seven sturgeon species and ten F2 hybrid strains from sturgeon farms in China. We found that introgressive hybridization is pervasive and exists in both purebred and hybrid farmed sturgeons  which may reflect widespread mismanagement of sturgeon breeding in China. We also found that farmed sturgeons hybridize with each other to varying degrees and with high genetic diversity.

A mate selection tool was used to optimize in retrospect the actual selection and matings conducted over the project period to assess if the observed genetic gains in body weight could have been achieved with a reduced level of inbreeding. In the actual selection  the genetic trends for yearling weight  fertility of ewes and survival of lambs were 0.81 kg  –0.00026% and 0.016% per generation. The average inbreeding coefficient remained zero for the first few generations and then tended to increase over generations.

A mate selection tool was used to optimize in retrospect the actual selection and matings conducted over the project period to assess if the observed genetic gains in body weight could have been achieved with a reduced level of inbreeding. In the actual selection  the genetic trends for yearling weight  fertility of ewes and survival of lambs were 0.81 kg  –0.00026% and 0.016% per generation. The average inbreeding coefficient remained zero for the first few generations and then tended to increase over generations. The genetic gains achieved with the optimized retrospective selection and matings were highly comparable with the observed values  the correlation between the average breeding values of lambs born from the actual and optimized matings over the years being 0.99. However  the level of inbreeding with the optimized mate selections remained zero until late in the years of selection. Our results suggest that an optimal selection strategy that considers both genetic merits and coancestry of mates should be adopted to sustain the Menz sheep breeding program. Selective breeding is expected to reduce fitness of animal populations through its negative effect on genetic diversity  particularly in small closed populations. The reduction in fitness caused by intensive selection for production traits is more severe under random mating systems due to more frequent mating between close relatives []. Optimum genetic gains while minimizing inbreeding can be achieved by adopting appropriate selection and mating designs. Such designs include the family mating design []  where mating permissions are restricted within mating groups  and minimum coancestry mating  which involves individual mate selection that limits the contribution of individuals to future generations [–]. A selective breeding program for the Menz sheep breed in Ethiopia has been ongoing in a closed nucleus flock since 1998. Remarkable improvements in body weight have been recorded []. The objectives of this paper were to evaluate the current Menz sheep breeding program in terms of genetic trends in fitness (fertility and survival)  as related to inbreeding  and to investigate whether the observed genetic gains in body weight could have been achieved with a reduced level of inbreeding by optimizing the actual selection and matings conducted over the project years by adopting the individual mate selection approach. A closed nucleus population of Menz sheep was established in 1998 in the subalpine highlands at the Debre Birhan Agricultural Research Center in Ethiopia. Selection of breeding stocks was based on estimated breeding values (EBV) for yearling weight which were estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) procedure fitting a univariate model. Mating was carried out according to a family mating design  in which random mating of individuals was allowed within mating groups [  ]. The mating groups were created by dividing the foundation flock into five groups at the beginning of the breeding program. The mating groups remained closed with female replacements coming from within the group  but rams were not permitted to mate in their groups of origin. Data obtained from the Menz sheep nucleus flock from 1998 to 2008 was used to estimate genetic trends in yearling weight  ewe fertility  pre-weaning lamb survival and level of inbreeding. Ewe fertility and pre-weaning lamb survival are binary traits and are defined respectively  as number of ewes lambing combined as a proxy measure to pregnancy  and as survival of a lamb from birth to weaning at three months. Ewes lambing and lambs surviving were assigned a value of 1  whereas ewes not lambing and lambs not surviving a value of 0. The pedigree data used to estimate breeding values consisted of 2194 animals born from 709 dams and 80 sires  spanning over seven generations of pedigree for yearling weight and survival and six generations for fertility. A total of 1142  1842 and 2152 records were available for yearling weight  survival and fertility  respectively. Breeding values were estimated for all traits by fitting mixed linear models. This ignores the categorical nature of the binary traits fertility and survival. However  several studies have shown that linear models that assume underlying continuous distributions can be applied to estimate genetic parameters [  ] and linear and threshold models have given very similar heritability estimates for survival in another Menz sheep population []. Breeding values and inbreeding coefficients () for each animal were estimated simultaneously using WOMBAT [] by fitting the following univariate model: where  is a vector of observations for trait    a vector of fixed effects for trait  (sex  season  year and dam age for yearling weight and lamb survival; season  year and age for ewe fertility)   a vector of random animal effects for trait    a vector of random residual effects for trait  and  and  are incidence matrices relating records for trait  to fixed and random animal effects  respectively. The actual matings carried out in the Menz sheep breeding program were revised in retrospect. For the optimized retrospective selection and mating  we used the actual candidates and parameters in each mating year  with selection on yearling weight and individual mate selection with minimum coancestry using the mate selection tool MateSel version 1.5 []  based on the principles of optimal contributions of parents to future generations [  ]. Optimization was attempted by placing a hard constraint on genetic gain and constraining the threshold of progeny inbreeding to 1%. A maximum of five and a minimum of three sires (mating groups) were considered in each mating year. The average EBV and inbreeding coefficients of lambs born in each year of the optimized matings were compared with the actual values obtained in the breeding program. Average EBV for yearling weight of lambs increased over the years of selection (Figure ). The average genetic trend per year  calculated by regressing average EBV on year of birth  was 0.81 kg. The average inbreeding coefficient remained zero for the first few generations and below the acceptable level of 1% in later generations (Figure ). However  the trend increased over generations. The rate of inbreeding (<U+0394>) per generation calculated by regressing  on generation number was 0.17%. These results show that a high rate of genetic progress in growth can be achieved with an acceptable increase of less than 1%  per generation  at least in the short term.                                                                                                           The level of fertility was inconsistent over the period of selection (Figure ). However  the overall genetic trend was negative  with an average decline in EBV of 0.00026% per generation. Average EBV for survival showed an average increase of 0.016% per generation (Figure ). Correlations of individual coefficients of inbreeding with EBV for ewe fertility (<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.023) and lamb survival (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.074)  taken as indicators of the effect of inbreeding on fitness  were small and statistically not significant (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). These findings indicate that genetic progress in growth can be achieved without a significant decline in fitness  at least in the short term  provided that a family mating scheme  rather than a random mating scheme is adopted. Random mating has been experimentally shown to result in a higher level of inbreeding and reduced fitness [].                                                                                                           The genetic gains in yearling weight that were achieved in the optimized retrospective selection and matings were compatible with the observed values (Table )  the correlation between the average EBV of lambs born from the actual and optimized matings over the years being 0.99. However  the level of inbreeding with optimized mate selections remained zero until late in the years of selection  with only minimal inbreeding in the last two generations (<U+2009><<U+2009>1%). This was in contrast with the earlier buildup of inbreeding in the actual selection program. Similarly  the percentage of individuals with inbreeding coefficients greater than 1% reached 25 to 50% in the actual breeding program  compared to only 3 to 5% in the retrospectively optimized mating scheme. Furthermore  among the animals born in 2008  all were inbred in the actual selection program  with  ranging from 0.098 to 6.25%  whereas only 45.0% were inbred in the simulated population  with  ranging from 0.1 to 1.56%. Family mating has proved to be an efficient mating tool to achieve maximum gains in productive traits with minimal losses in fitness traits in the short term. However  a strategy involving optimal mate selection that considers both genetic merits and coancestry of mates should be adopted to sustain the Menz sheep breeding program in the long run.

For QTL detection  it is recommended to use a large dataset and to focus on highly heritable traits and on the largest QTL. QTL statuses were inferred based on the distribution of the contrast between chromosomal segment effects. The first step in the identification of causative mutations underlying quantitative traits is to search for genomic regions associated with these traits  called quantitative trait loci (QTL). With the availability of genetic markers  a large number of QTL has been reported for various species and traits [–]. However  taking the final step from QTL to causative mutation has proven more difficult. In farm animals  most economically important traits are complex and involve a large number of genes  each with a small effect. Furthermore  due to long range linkage disequilibrium  as is the case in dairy cattle []  several markers can be in linkage disequilibrium with the causative mutation rather than only the markers closest to the mutation. As a consequence  reported QTL often have large confidence intervals []  making the search for causative mutations difficult  and mutations underlying such traits have been identified only in a few cases []. Accurate and precise QTL mapping is thus a prerequisite to the search for causative mutations. A large variety of models for QTL detection exists  including single-marker models  interval mapping [] and Bayesian models []. Since quantitative traits are likely to be influenced by a large number of QTL  models that analyse all markers simultaneously should give more accurate results than models that analyse only one or a few markers at a time. With the Bayesian models developed for genomic selection  a large number of markers can be analysed simultaneously []. In a simulation study by Sahana et al. []  Bayesian QTL mapping resulted in higher power and more precise QTL locations than single-marker  haplotype-based or mixed-model approaches. When dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips are used  loci influencing a trait are assumed to be in linkage disequilibrium with one or more markers. Genomic selection models exploit this linkage disequilibrium to estimate the effects of the markers and genomic breeding values []. Although the focus in the development of these models has been to estimate breeding values rather than to identify QTL  the estimated marker effects show potential use for QTL mapping []. For the original models proposed by Meuwissen et al. []  either all markers were included in the model (Bayes A)  or the proportion of markers included in the model was fixed at a certain value (Bayes B). To overcome the statistical problems associated with these models reported by Gianola et al. []  Habier et al. [] proposed several modifications of the original models  including Bayes Cp and Bayes C. In Bayes Cp  the proportion of markers included in the model is assigned a prior distribution and estimated during the analysis  while in Bayes C  the proportion is given a fixed value. In a simulation by Sun et al. []  Bayes Cp was successful in identifying large QTL. Bayes C has been used to identify QTL for various traits in beef cattle [  ]  the horse [] and pigs [  ]. The performance of the Bayesian genomic selection models is known to be influenced by the genetic architecture of the trait and the number of records used to estimate the marker effects; the accuracy of predicted breeding values decreases with decreasing heritability [  ] and an increasing number of QTL [  ] and a large number of records is needed to obtain high accuracy []. Although several studies have evaluated the impact of these factors on the accuracy of breeding value estimation  their impact on the use of these models for QTL mapping is unknown. The regions detected by QTL mapping generally contain a large number of polymorphisms that could be the causative mutation. However  assuming only one true causative mutation in a QTL  an individual’s genotype for the causative mutation should be in concordance with its status for the QTL: if the individual is homozygous for the QTL  it should be homozygous for the causative mutation  and if the individual is heterozygous for the QTL  it should also be heterozygous for the causative mutation []. By comparing the status of the QTL and polymorphisms in the QTL region  all polymorphisms with statuses that are not in concordance with the statuses of the QTL can be eliminated as potential causative mutations. Using this approach  Karlsson et al. [] were able to eliminate more than half of the candidate polymorphisms for a causative mutation involved in coat colour in dogs. However  if non-concordant polymorphisms are eliminated  it is important that prediction of the QTL status is correct. One possibility to determine the QTL status is to compare the estimated marker effects of the two haplotypes that an individual carries in the QTL region: if the effects of the haplotypes are very different  the individual is likely heterozygous for the QTL  while if the difference is close to zero  it is likely to be homozygous. The first objective of this study was to evaluate by simulation the influence of heritability  number of QTL and number of records on the accuracy of QTL mapping with genomic prediction methods Bayes Cp and Bayes C. Our second objective was to estimate the accuracy of the prediction of the status of the causative mutation using the estimated marker effects from Bayes C. The study focussed on the largest QTL because they are the natural candidates for molecular identification of a causative mutation. It aimed at answering the following questions: are we able to detect the largest QTL? Are they true QTL? Are we able to infer correctly the QTL status of the individuals? QTL and phenotypes were simulated for different heritabilities and numbers of QTL. An existing real dataset was used as a base for the simulation. It consisted of 4387 genotyped French Holstein bulls  with a pedigree of 12 142 individuals. The genotypes were obtained with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 Bead Chip® by Labogena. After removal of SNPs with a minor allele frequency below 5%  38 277 SNPs were retained for analysis. Simulations were carried out in nine scenarios  with heritability (h) of 0.1  0.4 or 0.7 and 10  100 or 1000 biallelic QTL  in both the full dataset and a subset consisting of 1500 randomly selected individuals from the full dataset. Table  summarizes the nine simulation scenarios. For the scenarios with 100 QTL and a heritability of 0.4 or 0.7  the simulation was run 11 times. It was run only once for the others. The simulated QTL were divided into three groups: large  medium and small QTL. In the scenarios with 10 QTL  there were one large  two medium and seven small QTL  in the scenarios with 100 QTL  five large  20 medium and 75 small QTL  and in the scenarios with 1000 QTL  50 large  200 medium and 750 small QTL. With the high QTL density in the scenarios with 1000 QTL  the goal was to assess whether the model could distinguish the larger QTL from the smaller ones. Together  the QTL explained 70% of the genetic variance. Large and medium QTL explained respectively 9 and 3 times the variance of a small QTL. The locations of the QTL were determined by random sampling of the SNP number. The QTL were subsequently discarded from the genotype file used in later analyses to estimate the SNP effects. The phenotypic variance  was set at 100. Allele substitution effects () were scaled as follows. The frequency  of one of the alleles of the  QTL was computed in order to adjust QTL effect  such that  equalled the part of the variance explained by the QTL. To generate residual polygenic effects  breeding values of founder animals were drawn from a normal distribution  with polygenic variance  set to 30% of the total genetic variance. Breeding values of individuals with known parents were drawn from a normal distribution  where  and  equal the breeding values of an individual’s sire and dam. Breeding values of individuals with a known sire but unknown dam were drawn from a normal distribution . The simulated performance of an individual was calculated as the sum of its polygenic value  the sum of its QTL effects and an environmental effect drawn from a normal distribution . The effect of each SNP was estimated using methods Bayes Cp and Bayes C [] as implemented in the GS3 software []. For both methods  the statistical model was: where  is the phenotype for individual    the overall mean   the number of markers   the genotype of individual  for marker  coded 0  1 or 2 depending on the number of copies of a given marker allele the individual carried   the additive effect of marker   and  the random residual for individual . All unknown parameters were assigned prior distributions and sampled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) using Gibbs sampling. The MCMC was run for 180 000 iterations  with a burn-in of 20 000 iterations and thin interval of 50. The prior used for  was a mixture distribution that equalled: Where  is the common marker effect variance and the hyper parameter p is the prior probability that the effect of marker  is 0. Variances    and  were assigned inverted chi-square distributions with <U+2009>=<U+2009>4.2 degrees of freedom and scale parameter  where  equals the prior value of  or . When Bayes Cp was used  p was assigned a uniform distribution and sampled with the MCMC. For Bayes C  p was fixed at 0.99  based on the estimates obtained with Bayes Cp in the scenarios for which p converged. As QTL detection criterion  the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) was used  which is the proportion of iterations that included a specific marker in the model. Detection was based on either the PIP of individual markers  or the PIP summed over intervals of adjacent markers. Different interval sizes were tested  consisting of 20  40  60 or 80 markers  corresponding on average across the genome respectively to 1.3  2.6  3.9 and 5.3 Mb. Because our goal was to identify large QTL rather than all QTL  the 10 markers with the highest PIP that were more than 4 Mb apart or the 10 non-overlapping intervals with the highest PIP were declared QTL. In the simulation  a detected QTL was denoted false positive if there was no true QTL within a distance of 2 Mb on either side of the marker or within the interval  depending on the criterion that was used. Prior to analysis  genotypes were phased in order to define haplotypes. Phasing was done using DagPhase []  accounting for both family structure and population linkage disequilibrium. To predict the status of an individual for a simulated causative mutation  first the estimated effects of all markers in an identified QTL interval were summed up for each haplotype that the individual carried. Second  the absolute value of the difference between the estimated effects of an individual’s two haplotypes was used to group individuals by partitioning around medoids (PAM) []  as implemented in the fpc R-package []  where the number of clusters () is estimated on the basis of optimum average silhouette []. The PAM algorithm was as follows:  medoids were randomly selected from the data. All non-medoids were assigned to the closest medoid and the costs of configurations  when the medoids and data points were switched  were calculated. The configuration with the lowest cost was selected. Steps 2 and 3 were repeated until there was no longer any change in the medoids. A range of 2 to 4 was used to estimate . The status of animals in the cluster with the lowest haplotype difference was denoted homozygous  and that of animals in the cluster with the highest difference was denoted heterozygous. If more than two clusters were present  the status of animals in the other clusters was denoted unknown. To evaluate the accuracy of status prediction  predicted statuses were compared with the true statuses in order to compute the proportion of correct  incorrect and unknown statuses. The posterior distribution of the proportion of markers included in the Bayes Cp model (1-p) for the full dataset is shown in Figure . Only in the scenarios with 10 or 100 QTL and a heritability of 0.4 or 0.7  did the posterior distribution of p show a strong peak. In the other scenarios  values taken by p ranged from 0 to 1. In the subset data  a clear peak in the posterior distribution of p was only observed with a heritability of 0.7 and 10 or 100 QTL. For scenarios without a clear peak  the average PIP was much higher than for scenarios with a strong peak. As shown in Figure   for a scenario without a strong peak  the average PIP was high and the peaks were much smaller and broader for Bayes Cp than for Bayes C. Table  shows the average number of markers included in the model in the full dataset. For all scenarios  the number of included markers was much higher than the number of simulated QTL.  (-)  The MCMC chain was run for 180 000 iterations; scenarios differed in the number of QTL (10  100  or 1000) and heritability (h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1  0.4  or 0.7).  ()  Scenario with 100 simulated QTL and heritability equal to 0.1; the red  orange and green dots on the x-axes show the true positions of the large  medium  and small simulated QTL  respectively. The accuracy of QTL detection was influenced by both heritability and the number of simulated QTL. Table  shows the numbers of correctly identified QTL and false positives for the nine scenarios  both when intervals consisting of 60 subsequent markers were selected on the basis of the sum of the PIP of all markers in the interval  and when markers were individually selected according to their PIP. Both for selection of intervals and of markers  the number of correctly identified QTL and the number of false positives were highly affected by heritability and number of QTL. The number of false positives decreased with increasing heritability. Furthermore  the number of false positives was higher with 100 QTL than with 10 QTL. With 1000 QTL  due to the large number of QTL  there was on average 1.6 QTL present per haplotype region and thus hardly any false positives were found. Most detected QTL were  however  small  meaning that most large QTL were not in the 10 selected regions. In most cases  selection of intervals resulted in fewer or equal false positives than selection of markers  except in the scenario with 10 QTL and a heritability of 0.7  which had two and one false positives for selection based on intervals and markers  respectively. Generally  the proportion of large QTL detected was greater than the proportions of medium and small QTL detected. However  with 1000 QTL  hardly any large QTL were detected when intervals were selected but larger QTL were detected when selecting individual markers. For example  with 1000 QTL and a heritability of 0.7  selecting intervals led to the detection of only one large QTL  while selection of markers detected five large QTL. For the scenarios with 100 QTL and a heritability of 0.4 and 0.7  the simulation was run ten times. The results of these repeated simulations are shown in Table . The mean number of false positives over ten runs was 0.40 and 0.10 for heritabilities of 0.4 and 0.7  respectively. The number of records had a strong influence on the accuracy of QTL detection. Figure  shows the number of false positives for both the full dataset and the subset. The number of false positives was higher for the subset than for the full dataset. The difference was largest in the scenarios with 10 QTL and a heritability of 0.4  which had only one false positive with the full dataset but five false positives with the subset.  Intervals consisted of 60 adjacent markers; the full dataset and the subset consisted of respectively 4387 and 1500 records. Figure  shows the effect of interval size on the number of false positives. In the scenarios with 1000 QTL  the genome was saturated with QTL  and there were hardly any intervals without a QTL. As we were interested in identifying the largest QTL  we redefined the number of false positives as the number of detected intervals without QTL or with only small QTL for these scenarios. The number of false positives decreased with increasing interval size. This decrease was stronger when the number of QTL was greater  and was most pronounced with a heritability of 0.4.  The ten intervals with the highest summed posterior inclusion probabilities were selected. Figure  shows the number of false positives when more than 10 intervals were selected. The number of false positives in the scenarios with 1000 QTL was defined as previously described. In all scenarios  the number of false positives increased when more intervals were selected. This increase was lower with a higher heritability  especially with 100 QTL.  Intervals consisted of 60 adjacent markers. Figure  shows the proportion of correct  incorrect and undefined statuses for the scenarios with 100 QTL and a heritability of 0.4 and 0.7. On average  QTL status prediction was correct for approximately 50% of the individuals but this percentage differed strongly between QTL  ranging from 20.4% to 97.7%. Size of the QTL did not affect the percentage of correctly predicted statuses. The shape of the distributions of the haplotype differences varied largely between QTL. As shown in Figure   for a QTL with status predicted with almost 100% accuracy  the homozygous and heterozygous individuals formed two clearly separated groups  while for the QTL that gave the poorest status predictions  there was complete overlap between homozygous and heterozygous individuals. The accuracy of status prediction was affected by the number of QTL in the neighbourhood of the causative mutation. Figure  shows that the proportion of correctly predicted statuses was highest when there was no other QTL within 10 Mb of the causative mutation  although this effect was larger with a heritability of 0.4 than with a heritability of 0.7. Furthermore  when there was only one QTL present  clustering almost always resulted in two groups and no unknowns  while with more QTL close to one another  the individuals were divided into three or four groups  so that status was undefined for some animals.  For scenarios with heritabilities (h) of 0.4 and 0.7  100 QTL were simulated 10 times  of which five were large (L)  20 medium (M) and 75 small (S).  Haplotype effects were estimated by the sum of the estimated marker effects for all markers in the haplotype; distribution for the QTL with the highest (left) and lowest (right) status prediction accuracy.  Box plots showing the proportion of correctly and incorrectly predicted and undefined statuses  for scenarios with heritabilities (h) of 0.4 and 0.7; in both scenarios  100 QTL were simulated 10 times  of which five were large (L)  20 medium (M) and 75 small (S); the x-axis shows the number of QTL within a distance of 10 Mb of one another. The accuracy of QTL mapping was affected by heritability  number of QTL  and number of records. In the subset data  the number of false positives was very high in all scenarios  demonstrating the need for a large dataset. With a low heritability  the QTL effects were smaller than with a higher heritability  making it more difficult to accurately locate the QTL and thus resulting in a greater number of false positives. Therefore  better results will be obtained when progeny-based evaluations are used rather than individual phenotypes  since the heritability of progeny means is higher. This strategy based on daughter-yield-deviations or deregressed estimated breeding values is quite frequently used in dairy cattle []. When the number of QTL to explain a given amount of genetic variance increases  the individual QTL effects become smaller and the QTL thus become more difficult to detect and locate. Consequently  the number of false positives increased when the number of QTL increased from 10 to 100. However  with a further increase to 1000 QTL  the number of false positives decreased to 1 or 0 because with 1000 QTL on a total of 37 227 markers  an interval of 60 markers includes on average 1.6 QTL. Randomly selecting intervals would give the same result. The motivation for QTL mapping is the identification of large rather than small QTL. In the scenarios with 1000 QTL  mainly small QTL were found. It is  however  important to realise that large QTL in the scenarios with 1000 QTL had about the same size as the small QTL in the scenarios with 100 QTL and were much smaller than the small QTL in the scenarios with 10 QTL (Table ). For example  with a heritability of 0.4  a large QTL in the scenario with 1000 QTL explains 0.14% of the total phenotypic variance  while small QTL in the scenarios with 100 and 10 QTL explain 0.16% and 1.27%  respectively. The small size of the large QTL in the scenarios with 1000 QTL clearly makes it difficult to detect these QTL. Furthermore  with the large number of small and medium QTL in these scenarios  several small and medium QTL together can have a larger effect than a single large QTL. Based on our results  the variance explained by the QTL in an interval should roughly explain at least 1% of the phenotypic variance in order for the QTL to be detected. QTL detection can be based on several criteria  including marker effect  variance and PIP  either for each marker individually or summed up over an interval of adjacent markers. In this study  PIP was used as the detection criterion  for both markers and intervals. If several markers are in linkage disequilibrium with a QTL  the QTL effect can spread over several markers. In that case  selection based on intervals can give more accurate results than selection based on individual markers []. In most scenarios evaluated here  fewer false positives were found when intervals were selected than when markers were selected. However  as shown in Table   selection of intervals resulted in the detection of mainly small QTL and hardly any large QTL in the scenarios with 1000 QTL  while there were 50 large QTL simulated and only the best 10 intervals were selected. In contrast  when detection was based on individual markers  a much larger proportion of the detected QTL were large QTL. The intervals that were selected in this case were generally located in the proximity of several medium or large QTL. Selection of intervals can thus result in the identification of regions that are close to the largest number of QTL rather than regions that include the largest QTL. Therefore  for polygenic traits  selection of markers can give better results  in terms of identifying large QTL  than selection of intervals. Since the number of QTL influencing a trait is generally unknown  it is difficult to decide which approach to use  and the best option could be to combine both approaches and declare only QTL that have a high ranking for both criteria. When the interval size increased  the number of false positives decreased  as shown in Figure . However  increasing interval size makes the subsequent search for causative mutations more difficult  since the search area increases as well. Based on our results  interval sizes containing 40 to 60 markers and corresponding to on average 2.6 to 3.9 Mb  seem to be a reasonable compromise for the usual designs currently available in animal breeding. In results reported here  the 10 best markers or intervals were selected and denoted as QTL  which is only a small fraction of the total number of QTL in the scenarios with 100 and 1000 QTL. However  when more QTL are selected  the number of false positives increases rapidly. This is in agreement with other studies  in which Bayes A and B [] and Bayes Cp [] were successful in locating the large QTL but missed the smaller ones. The Bayesian genomic selection models are thus suitable for QTL mapping when the aim is to find the major QTL. In addition to previously discussed factors  linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL is required for the markers to pick up the effect of a QTL. The accuracy of genomic prediction with Bayesian models is lower in populations with a large effective population size and thus a low amount of linkage disequilibrium []. In this study  data were simulated using genotypes of French Holstein cattle. When applied to populations with a different effective population size  the accuracy of QTL mapping is expected to be different than observed here. In contrast to genomic prediction  the motivation for QTL mapping is not to capture the maximum amount of information on the trait but rather to capture information on markers close to the causative mutation. In a population in which linkage disequilibrium is present only over short distances  only markers near the causative mutation will have an effect  and thus a more accurate estimate of the QTL location is expected than with a population with long range linkage disequilibrium. The posterior distribution of p was affected by heritability  number of QTL and number of records. In scenarios for which the posterior distribution of p lacked a clear peak were the scenarios with a low heritability or a large number of QTL. In these scenarios  the variance explained by an individual QTL was small  increasing the difficulty of locating the QTL. For scenarios with a clear peak  the number of SNPs included in the model was much larger than the number of simulated QTL. This agrees with results of Habier et al. [] who reported that the number of SNPs with effect estimated on the basis of p was overestimated. In their results  the number of markers included in the model increased with decreasing heritability. The accuracy of breeding value predictions from Bayesian genomic selection models decreases and becomes more similar to the accuracy of GBLUP with decreasing heritability  increasing number of QTL and decreasing number of records  [  –]. The GBLUP model uses all markers to estimate breeding values on the basis of the genomic relationship between animals rather than based on individual marker effects []. In scenarios that did not show a clear peak in the posterior distribution of p  individual marker effects were small and thus more difficult to estimate. A possible explanation for the lack of a clear peak could be that in these cases  Bayes Cp acts similar to the GBLUP model and relies more on the genomic relationship between animals than on QTL effects  and therefore includes a large and variable proportion of markers in the model to capture relationships between animals. As a result  the average PIP of markers was high  and the peaks of PIP were relatively small deviations from this mean. In addition  a strong negative correlation was observed between p and . When p was fixed  the deviations from the mean were larger and sharper  as in Figure   making it easier to locate QTL. The accuracy of the predicted statuses of the causative mutations differed strongly between QTL. For some QTL  the accuracy was almost 100%  while for others the status of almost none of the individuals was correctly predicted. The accuracy of status predictions was affected by the presence of other QTL nearby. When the effect of the haplotypes is influenced by several QTL rather than by only one  the status of the QTL can be predicted correctly based on the difference between haplotype effects only if the statuses of all QTL influencing the haplotype effect are in concordance with each other. When this is not the case  the differences between haplotype effects of homozygous and heterozygous individuals overlap and it is not possible to cluster the individuals in two groups. Although the prediction of QTL status was influenced by the presence of other QTL nearby  their presence seemed to explain only part of the variation in prediction accuracy between QTL. It is not clear what caused the rest of the variation. In order to identify the causative mutation  it is important that the predicted QTL status of individuals is correct. Otherwise the true polymorphism could be eliminated because of lack of concordance with the QTL status. Although the status prediction was far from perfect  histograms of the haplotype differences clearly demonstrated whether the clustering was successful or not. As shown in Figure   when two clearly separated groups were visible  almost 100% of the statuses were correctly predicted  while histograms did not show separate groups for QTL with low prediction accuracy. The performance of Bayes Cp and Bayes C was highly affected by heritability  number of QTL and number of records. The number of false positives was high with low heritability  and decreased with increasing heritability. In polygenic scenarios  larger QTL were detected when detection was based on the PIP of individual markers than when based on the PIP summed up over a group of adjacent markers. Thus  a first conclusion is that Bayes C is a suitable method for QTL mapping when it is applied to traits with moderate to high heritability and when a large number of records are available. For Bayes Cp  there was no strong peak in the posterior distribution of p when heritability was low or the number of QTL was large  and a large number of SNPs were selected. In such cases  localisation of the QTL was more accurate with Bayes C. Furthermore  with moderate heritability  a large number of records was needed for p to show a clear peak in the posterior distribution. Therefore  a second conclusion is to recommend a high fixed value for p. The accuracy of the predicted status of the causative mutation is affected by the size of the QTL  as well as by the presence of other QTL nearby. Although the accuracy in general is not very high  a histogram of the haplotype differences can be used to decide whether the clustering is correct or not and thus usable for further analysis.

Most of the native pig breeds in Iberia are in danger of extinction  and the assessment of their genetic diversity and population structure  relationships and possible admixture between breeds  and the appraisal of conservation alternatives are crucial to adopt appropriate management strategies.MethodsA panel of 24 microsatellite markers was used to genotype 844 animals representing the 17 most important native swine breeds and wild populations existing in Portugal and Spain and various statistical tools were applied to analyze the results.ResultsGenetic diversity was high in the breeds studied  with an overall mean of 13.6 alleles per locus and an average expected heterozygosity of 0.80. Signs of genetic bottlenecks were observed in breeds with a small census size  and population substructure was present in some of the breeds with larger census sizes. Variability among breeds accounted for about 20% of the total genetic diversity  and was explained mostly by differences among the Celtic  Mediterranean and Basque breed groups  rather than by differences between domestic and wild pigs. Breeds clustered closely according to group  and proximity was detected between wild pigs and the Mediterranean cluster of breeds. Most breeds had their own structure and identity  with very little evidence of admixture  except for the Retinto and Entrepelado varieties of the Mediterranean group  which are very similar.

Most of the native pig breeds in Iberia are in danger of extinction  and the assessment of their genetic diversity and population structure  relationships and possible admixture between breeds  and the appraisal of conservation alternatives are crucial to adopt appropriate management strategies. A panel of 24 microsatellite markers was used to genotype 844 animals representing the 17 most important native swine breeds and wild populations existing in Portugal and Spain and various statistical tools were applied to analyze the results. Genetic diversity was high in the breeds studied  with an overall mean of 13.6 alleles per locus and an average expected heterozygosity of 0.80. Signs of genetic bottlenecks were observed in breeds with a small census size  and population substructure was present in some of the breeds with larger census sizes. Variability among breeds accounted for about 20% of the total genetic diversity  and was explained mostly by differences among the Celtic  Mediterranean and Basque breed groups  rather than by differences between domestic and wild pigs. Breeds clustered closely according to group  and proximity was detected between wild pigs and the Mediterranean cluster of breeds. Most breeds had their own structure and identity  with very little evidence of admixture  except for the Retinto and Entrepelado varieties of the Mediterranean group  which are very similar. Genetic influence of the identified breed clusters extends beyond the specific geographical areas across borders throughout the Iberian Peninsula  with a very sharp transition from one breed group to another. Analysis of conservation priorities confirms that the ranking of a breed for conservation depends on the emphasis placed on its contribution to the between- and within-breed components of genetic diversity. Native pig breeds in Iberia reveal high levels of genetic diversity  a solid breed structure and a clear organization in well-defined clusters. Until the 20th century  pig production throughout Europe was essentially based on local breeds  developed over centuries to fit specific production targets and environmental constraints. The situation changed dramatically with the intensification of agriculture in the mid-20th century  when pig production moved to more intensive systems based on a reduced number of transboundary breeds[]. This general pattern was largely observed in the Iberian Peninsula  with a unique feature  namely  several outbreaks of African swine fever in the mid 1950’s and 1960’s that resulted in the near disappearance of outdoor pig production and the extinction of the associated native breeds[]. Reversal of this intensification trend began gradually in the 1980’s  with a renewed interest of consumers for transformed products from local breeds raised in extensive systems. This led producers to attempt to restore the original native pig breeds from the few remaining animals that could be identified. As a consequence  some of these breeds are now well established  but many are still at risk of extinction  given their low census size [See Additional file: Table S1]. Native pig breeds in the Iberian Peninsula are broadly classified as belonging to either the Celtic or the Mediterranean breed groups[]. The Celtic group includes breeds raised in the Northern part of the Iberian Peninsula  characterized by a light skin color  long and bony body  large limbs  brachycephalic head  floppy ears and slow growth rate[]. The Mediterranean-type pig  often called “Ibérico”  occupies the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula  and is characterized by a dark-colored skin  with a pointed snout  small litters and by the presence of high amounts of subcutaneous and intramuscular fat[]. Several breeds or varieties are recognized in the Mediterranean group  classified according to their skin and hair color  existence of spots  lack of hair  morphology  etc.[]. In addition to these two large breed groups  other native pig breeds are raised in more isolated regions  including the Basque region  the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands  which may or may not have been influenced by the above-mentioned groups. The group classification and census size of the breeds included in our study are summarized in Table S1 [See Additional file: Table S1] and the corresponding geographical distribution is illustrated in Figure S1 [See Additional file: Figure S1]. A detailed knowledge of the structure and relationships among breeds in a given species is a prerequisite to adopt appropriate conservation strategies and measures[]  which are essential to maintain genetic diversity for the future. Neutral genetic markers  such as microsatellites  are widely used to analyze population structure and relationships and to characterize the genetic diversity of species and populations. In pigs  this approach has been applied to analyze the genetic diversity of several Spanish and Portuguese breeds both at the local level[    –]  and at a broader level including many European breeds[  ]. Notwithstanding  some of the more isolated breeds from the Iberian Peninsula were absent from these studies  and it is known that local breeds  many of which are in danger of extinction  contribute significantly to the genetic variability of the species[]. Today  new statistical tools are available which refine our ability to detect  e.g.  how admixture among populations or fragmentation of some of the breeds may have affected their variability and genetic structure. In addition  the existence of wild pigs spread in many areas of the Iberian Peninsula provides the opportunity for admixture with domestic pigs  which has been demonstrated by the existence of wild boar signatures in mitochondrial DNA of Portuguese domestic pigs[]. In this study  we used a set of microsatellite markers in a comprehensive sample of domestic and wild pig populations from the Iberian Peninsula to: (1) evaluate the existing levels of genetic diversity and corresponding population structure; (2) assess the relationships among breeds and the distinctiveness and homogeneity of the breed groups commonly considered; (3) investigate the possible admixture which may have occurred  both among domestic pig breeds and with their wild relatives; and (4) evaluate conservation alternatives  based on the current levels of between- and within-breed genetic diversity. Individual blood samples were collected from 731 animals representing the major native pig breeds that are recognized in Portugal and Spain  namely the Alentejano (ALE  n = 66)  Bísaro (BIS  n = 49) and Malhado de Alcobaça (MAL  n = 36) breeds from Portugal  and the Celta (CEL  n = 27)  Chato Murciano (CHM  n = 53)  Entrepelado (ENT  n = 73)  Euskal Txerria (ETX  n = 56)  Lampiño (LAM  n = 59)  Manchado de Jabugo (MJA  n = 41)  Negro Canario (NCA  n = 53)  Negro de Formentera (NFO  n = 21)  Negro de los Pedroches (NPE  n = 29)  Negro Mallorquín (NMA  n = 20)  Retinto (RET  n = 88) and Torbiscal (TOR  n = 60) breeds from Spain. Samples were obtained from animals in different herds and preferably unrelated up to the third generation  in order to capture the largest possible representation of the existing genetic diversity. Blood samples were collected either in slaughter plants or by qualified veterinarians through their routine practice  in the framework of official programs aimed at the identification  health control and parentage confirmation of the breeds and populations included in our study. Therefore  no ethical approval was required for sampling of biological material. In addition to the native pig breeds  113 samples from wild boars obtained in Spain (SWB  n = 74) and Portugal (PWB  n = 39) were also included in our study. With the exception of the NFO and NPE breeds  all the domestic breeds included in our study are officially recognized and registered in herdbooks. For most breeds  a separate herdbook is kept for each breed  but for the ENT  RET  LAM  MAJ and TOR breeds they are registered as varieties of the “Ibérico” breed  in separate sections of the herdbook. A panel of 24 microsatellite markers was established [See Additional file: Table S2]  according to the recommendations of FAO and the International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG)[]. Allele nomenclature was standardized according to the ISAG Pig Comparison Test  in which we are actively involved. Reference samples are available upon request. Primers were labeled with fluorescent markers to distinguish between fragments of similar size  and microsatellite markers were grouped in multiplex reactions  according to PCR conditions and expected fragment sizes[]. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis  with an automatic sequencer ABI377XL (Applied Biosystems  Applera Europe B.V.)  allele sizing was estimated by using the internal size standard GeneScan-400HD ROX (Applied Biosystems  Madrid  Spain) and a reference sample was also included in each run  to correct for the few variations in allele size assignation among runs. Genotypes were read with the ABI PRISM GeneScan v.3.1.2 software (Applied Biosystems  Madrid  Spain) and interpreted with the ABI PRISM Genotyper v.3.7 NT software (Applied Biosystems  Madrid  Spain). Different parameters of genetic diversity were estimated and analyzed  as outlined in Table S3 [See Additional file: Table S3]. Briefly  the total number of alleles per marker  allele frequencies  observed and expected heterozygosities and effective numbers of alleles per locus were obtained with the Microsatellite toolkit[] and POPGENE[]  while compliance to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the Fisher’s exact test with the GENEPOP package[]. Wright’s F-statistics were calculated with the FSTAT package[] with confidence intervals for the F estimates obtained with GENETIX[]  and phylogenetic analyses were carried out with the POPULATIONS software[]  to estimate the genetic distances among breeds. A neighbour-net dendrogram was constructed with the SPLITSTREE4 package[] based on the matrix of genetic distances  and a tree representing individual genetic distances was obtained with the POPULATIONS software[]. A hierarchical analysis of variance was performed to partition the total genetic variance into components due to inter-individual  breed or group differences  using the AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) module of ARLEQUIN 3.5.1.3.[]. Factors  such as species  country or genetic group  contributing to the genetic variability were assessed  and estimated variance components were used to compute fixation indices. The same software package was used to draw a matrix based on F distances among breeds. The proportion of mixed ancestry in the populations analyzed was evaluated with the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented by the STRUCTURE v.2.1. computer program[]  which assumes that an individual may have mixed ancestry from different underlying populations and uses multilocus genotypes and a Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation to infer population structure and to assign individuals to the assumed populations. In our case  different numbers of assumed populations (K) were evaluated (from K = 2 to K = 17) with the mixed ancestry model  and the adequateness of the different alternatives was tested by Ln Pr(X|K)  i.e.  the likelihood of the observed distribution of genotypes given the assumed number of “ancestral” populations. For the different values of K considered  10 runs of 5*10 iterations were carried out  following a burn-in period of 1*10 iterations  and the results graphically displayed with the DISTRUCT software[]. Genetic differentiation on a geographical basis was investigated using the R software[] to draw synthetic contour maps of the Iberian Peninsula  based on the interpolation of genetic contributions to each domestic breed that were computed in the analysis with Structure for K = 3 and considering the center point of the dispersion of each breed. The relative importance of each domestic breed analyzed for conservation purposes was assessed by considering its contribution to total genetic diversity  assigning different weights to the between- and within-breed components of genetic diversity. First  Weitzman’s approach[] was applied to calculate the partial contributions of each breed to total genetic diversity  using Reynolds’ genetic distances in the estimation algorithm. Alternatively  the contribution of a breed to within-breed diversity was evaluated by its partial contribution to expected heterozygosity. In an attempt to combine both perspectives  the method of Eding et al.[] was applied  to analyze the contribution of a breed to a core set using molecular information to estimate the within- and between-breed kinships. After investigating different alternatives to account for molecular coancestries  the weighted log-linear mixed model (WLMM) of Eding and Meuwissen[] was chosen. For the 24 microsatellite loci analyzed  304 alleles were detected in the 844 individuals of the 17 populations studied [See Additional file: Table S2]. Polymorphism was high for all loci  with the number of alleles per locus ranging from 6 for S0227 to 31 alleles for S0005 and a mean number of alleles per locus of 13.63±3.52. The effective number of alleles and allelic richness accounting for sample size  averaged across loci and breeds  were 3.95±1.93 and 5.41±1.76  respectively. The means across loci for the expected and observed heterozygosities were 0.800±0.062 and 0.718±0.065  respectively  with a within-breed deficit in heterozygosity pooled over loci and breeds of 0.078±0.010. The proportion of genetic variability accounted for by differences among breeds  estimated by  in Table S2 [See Additional file: Table S2]  was 0.198±0.007 across loci  when all 17 populations were considered. Of the different locus-breed combinations  nearly 20% deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg proportions  such that the mean number of breeds showing departure from equilibrium was 3.54±1.84 per locus. Indicators of genetic diversity per breed (Table ) point toward a higher number of alleles  both in mean number of alleles and allelic richness  in wild populations than in the Iberian domestic breeds. The ETX  MJA  NFO and MAL breeds had the lowest mean number of alleles  effective number of alleles and allelic richness. The ETX  MJA and NFO breeds also had the lowest levels of expected and observed heterozygosity  while wild pigs from Portugal and Spain and the domestic BIS and CEL breeds had the highest levels of genetic diversity. For the whole group of breeds studied  the mean deficit in heterozygosity was 0.078  resulting from either inbreeding  or population substructure (Wahlund effect)  or both. Most of the breeds analyzed showed a significant deficit in heterozygosity  which was nearly 0.17 in CEL and NFO  and between 0.1 and 0.15 in CHM  NCA  TOR  SWB and BIS. Most breeds also presented at least one locus not complying with Hardy-Weinberg proportions  with a mean number of 1.65±1.17 loci per breed showing significant deviation from equilibrium. The pairwise matrix of F distances among the 17 populations studied is shown in Figure . Overall  the ETX breed showed the highest degree of differentiation compared to all the other breeds  while the lowest levels of breed differentiation were found among some of the Mediterranean breeds which are considered to be varieties of the “Iberico” pig (RET  ENT  LAM  ALE). The distance between the SWB and PWB populations was also small  but similar to the distance between the PWB and ALE populations.  Colours representing breed distances are defined on the scale at the right side of the figure; breed abbreviations are as defined in Table . The Nei D and Reynolds genetic distances among the 17 populations analyzed are shown in Table S4 [See Additional file: Table S4]. The results are similar to those described for the F distances  with a stronger differentiation between ETX and the remaining breeds  both in terms of mean distance and individual distances relative to all other breeds. Again  the PWB showed a close proximity to the ALE and RET breeds (D distance of 0.103 and 0.114  respectively)  not much larger than the distance found between PWB and SWB (D of 0.080). The neighbour-net drawn from Nei’s D genetic distances (Figure ) visualizes the relationships between populations. It identifies three distinct clusters  in addition to two domestic breeds which are clearly separated  i.e.  ETX from the Basque region and NFO from the Balearic Islands. The first observed cluster corresponds to the Celtic group of breeds  which includes the CEL  BIS  MAL and CHM breeds  plus the NCA breed from the Canary Islands. Another major cluster includes the Mediterranean-type breeds  i.e.  ALE  ENT  RET  TOR  LAM  NPE and MJA  which share a common origin and a close geographical distribution  and are often considered as varieties of the “Iberico” group of pigs. In addition  the NMA breed  which is from the Balearic Islands but has morphological traits similar to the Mediterranean-type group  is also a member of this cluster. The last cluster contains the wild pigs sampled from Portugal and Spain  which are very close to each other and also quite close to the Mediterranean cluster. Indeed  our results suggest a closer proximity between pigs from the Mediterranean cluster and wild boars than Celtic pigs.  Breed abbreviations are as defined in Table . In the principal components analysis (PCA)  the first three components accounted for nearly 43% of the total variability  and a two-dimension plot (including the first two components) is shown in Figure . In this analysis  the ETX and NCA breeds were separated from the other breeds by the first and second axis  respectively. For the remaining breeds  those belonging to the Celtic branch were separated from the Mediterranean branch  while the latter group clustered together with the wild pig populations.  Values between brackets on both axes represent the contribution in % of each axis to total inertia; breed abbreviations are as defined in Table . An AMOVA was carried out to investigate the relative contribution of different factors to the observed genetic variability  with each factor considered in a separate analysis  i.e.  species (wild vs. domestic pigs)  country of origin (Portuguese and Spanish domestic breeds) and genetic group or branch (Celtic  Mediterranean and Basque  considering only the continental Iberian breeds). The results (Table ) indicate that neither species nor country contribute significantly to genetic differentiation (P > 0.10)  while differences among genetic groups accounted for about 12% (P < 0.001) of the observed variability. However  differences among breeds accounted for a significant proportion of the variability (P < 0.001) and were the most important factor in all models. The proportion of shared alleles between animals was used to build a neighbour-joining dendrogram of individuals (Figure ). The radial tree indicates that  in most cases  animals clustered very well according to breed. However  exceptions to this general pattern are (1) the separation of the SWB animals into two separate clusters that nevertheless clustered with the PWB animals; (2) some of the breeds belonging to the Iberian branch did not completely separate from each other  including for example the RET  ENT and TOR breeds  which overlapped to some degree; and (3) the ALE animals were clustered in several small groups but remained quite homogeneous.  Breed abbreviations are as defined in Table . The Bayesian approach implemented by STRUCTURE was used to estimate the most likely number of ancestral populations underlying the observed genetic diversity. The likelihood of the observed data given the number of inferred ancestral populations [Ln Pr(X|K)] is shown in Figure S2 [See Additional file: Figure S2]  for numbers of inferred populations ranging from K = 2 to K = 17  with ten replications for each value of K. The mean value of Ln Pr(X|K) increased up to K = 16 and then dropped  with a large increase in its variance. Thus  it was assumed that K = 16 is the most likely number of ancestral populations that contribute to the observed genetic variability in the 17 breeds studied. Contributions of the assumed ancestral populations to each individual of the 17 breeds studied are presented in Figure   for values of K ranging between 2 and 16. When K = 2  there is a clear separation between the Celtic breeds and the Mediterranean group and the NMA and NFO breeds have a mixed ancestry. A very relevant feature at K = 2 is that wild pigs clearly share a common ancestry with breeds from the Mediterranean group  but no admixture with the Celtic breeds is detectable. When K = 3  the ETX breed separates completely from the remaining breeds  among which essentially the same relationships are maintained. As K increases  other breeds separate from their original groups and  for example  when K = 7 the wild populations separate from the “Iberico” pigs  the CHM and MAL breeds separate from the remaining Celtic breeds  while the NCA  MJA and TOR breeds separate into independent clusters and ALE  RET  ENT and NPE remain grouped in the same cluster. At this stage  the LAM breed shows some sub-structure  which at K = 11 is stronger and also observed in the BIS breed  while most of the other breeds are associated with a single underlying population. At K = 16  which was estimated as the most likely number of ancestral populations justifying the observed genetic variability in the 17 breeds studied  most breeds are clearly identified with a distinct ancestral population and limited admixture among breeds was detected. Nevertheless  the RET and ENT breeds remain clustered  suggesting that they derive from the same ancestral population. However  there is evidence of a clear sub-structure in some of the breeds studied  including  e.g.  SWB  BIS and LAM. All the other breeds are very homogeneous  and associated with a single ancestral population.  Each animal is represented by a single vertical line divided into K colours  where K is the number of assumed ancestral clusters that ranged from 2 to 16; the colored segment shows the individual’s estimated membership proportions in a given cluster; breed abbreviations are as defined in Table . The proportional contributions of the first three inferred ancestral populations to each continental Iberian domestic breed were used to investigate the geographical distribution of genetic differentiation across the Iberian Peninsula (Figure ). The results of these analyses indicate that the breeds of the Mediterranean group (which are essentially spread in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula) differ considerably from those of the Celtic group  and both groups are clearly distinct from the ETX breed which represents the Basque group. Overall  it is also clear that any breed difference that could be due to isolation resulting from national borders was completely overshadowed by genetic differentiation among breed groups  which are spread across borders. However  the distribution observed in Figure  mainly reflects the diversity in farm dimension and livestock production systems between the North and Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula  which in turn have a major impact on the type of pig that fits best in a given environment.  The contributions of each of the first three ancestral populations are represented by pink colors  and each sampled breed is represented by a black dot; () Mediterranean influence; () Celtic influence; () Basque influence. The Weitzman approach prioritizes breeds for conservation based on their contribution to between-breed diversity  and generally more isolated breeds tend to have higher values of partial contributions to genetic diversity. The results of the Weitzman analysis (Table ) indicate that four breeds showed partial contributions (PC) above 10% (NCA  NFO  ETX and MJA). These correspond to breeds which tend to be more isolated in the neighbour-net of Figure  and in the PCA of Figure   and which show signs of a strong isolation from the remaining Iberian breeds  i.e.  two breeds located in the Canary and Balearic islands (NCA and NFO  respectively)  with a reduced census size and a high level of reproductive isolation from Iberian Peninsula breeds  the MJA breed  which is a variety of Iberian pigs  with a very small census size and a narrow geographical distribution in western Andalucía and the ETX breed  which was nearly extinct at the end of the 20th century but has been recovered from a reduced number of animals and is kept relatively isolated in the Basque region. Another perspective of the contribution to genetic diversity concerns the partial contribution of a breed to expected heterozygosity (PC)  which takes into account the within-breed component of genetic variation (Table ). The highest PC values were obtained for the MAL  BIS and NPE breeds  and generally the breeds that ranked high in PC were the ones with the lowest PC. Nevertheless  the NCA and MAL breeds ranked in the top five breeds for both PC and PC  indicating that they correspond to exceptional situations of high contributions to both within- and between-breed genetic diversity. Finally  we estimated the contributions of the breeds to a core set  by taking into account their within- and between-breed kinships. In this case  marker-estimated kinships were used in a weighted log-linear mixed model that forces solutions allowing a maximum of one breed with a null contribution to the core set  in addition to weighing marker information to consider the amount of data per locus. Applying the WLMM approach  the NCA  BIS  ETX  CEL and CHM breeds  which have the highest PC or PC or at least positive values for both  showed the highest contribution to the core set. As a result of the variety of environmental conditions  management practices and selection procedures applied during many centuries  a large number of pig breeds have developed over time in the Iberian Peninsula and its archipelagos. These breeds are traditionally classified according to what is considered to be their common origin in two broad groups  i.e.  Celtic and Mediterranean[]. Generally  breeds of the Celtic group are mainly spread in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula while breeds of the Mediterranean group are mainly located in the southern part. In the past  pigs from any breed of these two groups may have been taken to the Balearic and Canary islands  and have founded or influenced the populations currently existing in those islands. In addition  these populations may have suffered later from the influence of breeds from other origins. Broadly speaking  pig production systems in the Iberian Peninsula have traditionally followed two very distinct models  which could have a direct impact on the genetic structure of the breeds to which they are associated. These systems roughly follow a geographical pattern. On the one hand  in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula  where farms tend to be smaller and to have scattered plots  producers usually have a small number of sows  which are traditionally raised in the backyard and fed domestic and horticultural by-products. On the other hand  in the southern regions  farms are much larger and pigs are raised free range and outdoors  where acorn and grass constitute their basic feedstuffs and the ecosystems integrate forest lands which are known as “dehesa” in Spain and “montado” in Portugal[]. The pigs kept under this system belong to the Mediterranean group and are generally known as “Iberico”  a classification that encompasses several distinct sub-populations which were included in our study. Our comprehensive analysis of the Iberian pig populations provides important information regarding their genetic diversity and structure  and brings to light new clues on the relationships existing among them and with their wild relatives. The 17 pig populations considered in our study showed considerable levels of genetic diversity  with an overall mean of 13.6 alleles per locus and an average expected heterozygosity of 0.80 for the 24 microsatellite loci considered here. At the breed level  the mean number of alleles per locus was 5.14  with an allelic richness corrected for sample size of 3.71 and an expected heterozygosity of about 0.53. These results are in line with those observed for several European pig breeds  but are somewhat lower than those reported for Asian breeds[]. The lack of compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium that was observed for at least one locus in most breeds is probably related to the overall deficit in heterozygosity in most of the breeds. This deficit could be a consequence of inbreeding or breed substructure  which are common features in local breeds of small census size[  ]  which is the case for nearly all the breeds included here. Moreover  deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to sampling error are expected given the number of breed-loci combinations and  as expected  these were more often observed in loci with a larger number of alleles [See Additional file: Table S2]. On average  genetic diversity was slightly higher in wild pigs than in domestic breeds  possibly as a result of the larger number and wider geographical distribution of the wild pigs. Among the domestic breeds  a few showed strong signs of genetic bottlenecks  expressed as reduced genetic and allelic diversity; this was especially true for breeds with the smallest census size or with a recent history of near-extinction  such as the ETX  MJA  NFO and MAL breeds. Of these breeds  only NFO showed an important deficit in heterozygosity  which was probably a consequence of accumulated inbreeding  while for the other three breeds the F estimate was very low or even negative  reflecting the producer’s efforts to favor mating between less related individuals and avoid increased inbreeding in these small populations. The CEL and BIS breeds displayed some common features  including a high allelic richness combined with some of the highest F estimates  which may indicate the existence of a fragmented sub-structure in these breeds of the Celtic group  as was also suggested by the analysis with STRUCTURE  especially for the BIS breed. This pattern could result from the fact that these nearly extinct breeds were restored in the 1980’s from a reduced number of animals and then resulted in distinct sub-lines that have been kept separate due to the wide geographical dispersion of the breeds and the very small size and isolation of the herds[]. However  it has been suggested that exotic genetic material may have been admixed with the BIS breed[]  which could have increased its allelic richness. In our study  the variability among breeds accounted for about 20% of the total genetic diversity  which is in line with the results reported in other studies on European pig breeds (21%)[] but is substantially higher than the between-breed diversity reported for other livestock species. The high differentiation among pig breeds reported here could have resulted from the fact that we included both wild and domestic pig populations  and breeds sampled in two different countries. However  this was not the case  since these factors were not significant in the AMOVA  and only the variability among the major domestic breed groups had a significant impact on genetic variability. Indeed  all the different analyses resulted in a clear differentiation between the Celtic  Mediterranean and Basque groups  with all breeds of one group clustering together genetically  and occupying a narrow geographical distribution. The only exception to this local expansion and distribution was the CHM breed  which expanded the northern influence of the Celtic group to the southeastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Consistently  the most distinct feature regarding breed relationships was the separation between the ETX breed and all the other breeds  which could reflect its separate origin and geographical isolation  but is probably also a consequence of its recent re-establishment from a small number of animals. A similar differentiation relative to other breeds was found for the French Basque pig breed[  ]  which is probably related to the ETX breed. A similar pattern of genetic distinctiveness has been reported for Basque human populations  who are considered to be genetic outliers among Europeans[]  confirming the genetic isolation that populations  both human and livestock  have experienced in this region for a long time. The NFO and NMA breeds from the Balearic Islands did not clearly separate from either the Celtic or the Mediterranean clusters  and the analysis with STRUCTURE confirmed that both could result from the admixture of these two groups. The NCA breed from the Canary Islands seems to share some genetic influences with the Celtic group  but it has become an isolated breed that is very distinct from all the others. Our results could not clearly establish whether this separation resulted from geographical isolation alone or from the possible existence of other influences  since large-scale exchanges are known to have occurred between the Canary Islands and Africa in the past  and perhaps the NCA breed reflects this influence[]. In any case  the NCA breed was so distinct from all the others that it was consistently ranked in the group with the top conservation priority. The CEL  BIS and MAL breeds  which are spread in the northwestern part of Iberia  clustered in the neighbour-net with the CHM breed  which is raised mostly in the southeastern coast  forming a well-defined cluster of Celtic breeds. This Celtic group of breeds of the Iberian Peninsula is believed to derive from northern-central European pig breeds[]  with perhaps the introduction of Chinese germplasm in the distant past[]  while the Mediterranean-type pig is assumed to be the pre-extant type in Iberia. One of the most pronounced features in our study was the clear separation between the Celtic and Mediterranean clusters in all the analyses  confirming the large genetic distance and the very distinct breeding practices between the two groups. For example  most of the Celtic breeds had the highest F estimates  presumably as a consequence of their very small herd size  which would result in accumulated inbreeding and population fragmentation. Indeed  the BIS breed showed a distinct sub-structure  with two well-defined subpopulations  which may result from the fact that the population was restored in the mid 1980’s from a small number of animals from two distinct regions[]. The close relationship between the CEL and BIS breeds detected in our study is probably the consequence of their common origin in the recent past[] while the proximity of the BIS and MAL breeds was already reported in previous studies[]. As anticipated  no differences could be detected between Spanish and Portuguese wild pigs  but a well differentiated subpopulation was detected in Spain in the analysis with STRUCTURE. This subpopulation corresponds to a genetically isolated group of wild pigs of the National Park of Doñana  kept under highly protective conditions preventing any mixing of the animals with those outside. Furthermore  they probably have a different reproductive behavior  because they are not subject to the increased pressure due to hunting. The weak differentiation between wild and domestic pig populations found in our study was not completely unexpected  since signs of admixture between these populations have been reported in the past  based on both microsatellite markers[] and mitochondrial DNA[]. Indeed  it has been suggested that recurrent backcrossing between domestic animals and their wild relatives is a common event in different species  contributing perhaps to increased genetic diversity[]. However  in our study with microsatellite markers  the proximity between domestic and wild pigs was only detected in the breeds of the Mediterranean branch  but not in Celtic breeds. This observed admixture could be due to accidental crossbreeding with wild relatives  since in the Mediterranean group  pigs are raised on open range farms throughout the year and fortuitous mating with wild pigs can occur. Such cases are much rarer in Celtic pigs  which are kept in small farms or villages  often in the backyard and in close contact with humans  thus preventing mating with wild pigs. Since wild pigs are not present in the Balearic or Canary Islands  such admixture is virtually impossible in the breeds from these islands. The different pig breeds of the Mediterranean group sampled in Portugal and Spain clustered together closely (Figures  and)  supporting the existence of a close genetic relationship among what are sometimes referred to as varieties of the “Iberico” pig[]. Nevertheless  animals from the same breed tended to cluster together (Figure ) and overall each breed remained with its own structure and identity except for a few cases  including the separation of the ALE breed into four different sub-groups  which clustered with the RET  NPE and TOR breeds or remained isolated. This could result from the existence of distinct sub-lines in the ALE breed that are known to have been admixed with other “Iberico” varieties in the past[]. In a few cases  some overlapping among varieties of “Iberico” was observed  i.e.  between the RET and ENT breeds  which shared a common origin and could not be clearly distinguished from each other  while the LAM breed had a subgroup that also shared a common origin with the RET and ENT breeds. This close relationship among the RET  LAM and ENT breeds probably reflects their past admixture. The TOR  NPE  and MAJ breeds remained isolated from the other “Iberico” varieties  thus confirming their uniqueness and identity. Overall  the distribution of the Mediterranean influence in pig breeds across the Iberian Peninsula (Figure ) almost exactly mirrors the distribution of oak and cork forests in the region[]  since these are the basis of the “dehesa-montado” system in which these pigs are traditionally raised. Hence  interdependence between animal and forest resources clearly occurred  which highlights the important role played by native pig breeds towards environmental sustainability. The definition of conservation priorities for animal genetic resources is an unsolved issue. Different approaches have been proposed to quantify the importance of a given breed for the conservation of genetic diversity[  ]. However  this should not be the only factor to be taken into account  since livestock breeds have other important features[  ]. For example  it has been widely recognized that local pig breeds in the Iberian Peninsula are the basis of local high-quality products  and are part of local culture  landscape  traditions  etc.  in addition to playing a key role in sustainable development[]. When conservation strategies focus on the contribution to genetic diversity  priorities will depend on the emphasis given to the between- and within-breed components of genetic diversity  which in turn depends essentially on the choice between a breed that is genetically unique or a breed that has a high genetic diversity  respectively. On the one hand  if only the between-breed contribution is considered (Weitzman approach)  the conservation priority will concern the more distinct breeds ETX  MJA  NFO and NCA  which are generally the breeds with the lowest census size  but also have the lowest levels of expected heterozygosity. However  as suggested by Cañon et al.[]  populations with low levels of genetic variability but with distinct features can be combined in crossbreeding strategies  resulting in new populations with high levels of heterozygosity. On the other hand  if the within-breed component of genetic diversity (heterozygosity approach) is considered  the conservation priority will concern the MAL  BIS  NPE and NCA breeds. This is the consequence of the high heterozygosity level of these breeds. However  in this case  three of the four breeds chosen for conservation belong to the Celtic group  which could be difficult to accept from a practical point of view. A more balanced solution would be to assess conservation priorities on the basis of the contribution of each breed to the overall diversity  based on its molecular contribution to between- and within-breed kinships. In our case  the priority would be given to the NCA  BIS  ETX and CEL breeds  which contribute most to the between- or within-breed components of genetic diversity. Thus  this solution represents a compromise between the two previous methods but no breed from the Mediterranean group would be selected for conservation  which would be in essence difficult to justify. Overall  our study of conservation priorities confirms that there is no single recommended approach  and that  depending on the emphasis placed on the between- or within-breed components of genetic diversity  the ranking of breeds for conservation may be very different  as discussed by Cañon et al.[]. Furthermore  when the contribution of each breed is considered individually  there is a risk that some clusters of breeds will be completely left out of the conservation priorities  which may not be desirable in practice. It is therefore important to further elaborate on the priorities of conservation of animal genetic resources  to account not only for breed contributions towards genetic variability  but also for their production and adaptation features  as well as for their economic  demographic  social  ecological  and cultural importance. The analysis of genetic diversity and conservation priorities based on neutral genetic markers  as carried out in our study  does not take into account the genetic variability of markers associated with production and adaptation traits  which often differ considerably among breeds. In recent years  high-density panels were developed capable of simultaneously detecting variability in thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)  and these could be instrumental in detecting genomic regions associated with both neutral and non-neutral sources of genetic variability. Hence  these SNP chips will provide a deeper insight into genetic diversity within- and between-breeds  population structure and selection signatures and their use in genetic diversity studies is very promising[]. Our results indicate that the genetic diversity in native pig breeds of the Iberian Peninsula is high and that the local isolated breeds  often with a small census size  are important reservoirs of genetic diversity. Several breeds had a significant deficit in heterozygosity  probably as a consequence of accumulated inbreeding  and the MJA and MAL breeds showed signs of genetic erosion. Nearly 20% of the observed diversity is due to differences among breeds  which is mostly due to variability among the Celtic  Mediterranean and Basque groups that are organized in very distinct breed clusters. The genetic distance between wild and domestic pig populations is small  and clear signs of admixture are observed between breeds from the Mediterranean group and their wild relatives but less so in the Celtic group. The Mediterranean populations included in our study represented varieties of the so-called “Iberico” pig group but  in spite of their close distribution  most of the varieties of this group were genetically distinct from each other and well-structured  while a few showed signs of admixture and/or fragmentation. The results presented here are useful to define conservation priorities and to adopt management strategies aimed at minimizing further losses of genetic diversity in the future.

Bayesian kernel ridge regression is a non-parametric prediction model proposed for this purpose. Its essence is to create a spatial distance-based relationship matrix called a kernel. Although the set of all single nucleotide polymorphism genotype configurations on which a model is built is finite  past research has mainly used a Gaussian kernel.ResultsWe sought to investigate the performance of a diffusion kernel  which was specifically developed to model discrete marker inputs  using Holstein cattle and wheat data. This kernel can be viewed as a discretization of the Gaussian kernel. The predictive ability of the diffusion kernel was similar to that of non-spatial distance-based additive genomic relationship kernels in the Holstein data  but outperformed the latter in the wheat data. However  the difference in performance between the diffusion and Gaussian kernels was negligible.ConclusionsIt is concluded that the ability of a diffusion kernel to capture the total genetic variance is not better than that of a Gaussian kernel  at least for these data. Although the diffusion kernel as a choice of basis function may have potential for use in whole-genome prediction  our results imply that embedding genetic markers into a non-Euclidean metric space has very small impact on prediction. Our results suggest that use of the black box Gaussian kernel is justified  given its connection to the diffusion kernel and its similar predictive performance."

We sought to investigate the performance of a diffusion kernel  which was specifically developed to model discrete marker inputs  using Holstein cattle and wheat data. This kernel can be viewed as a discretization of the Gaussian kernel. The predictive ability of the diffusion kernel was similar to that of non-spatial distance-based additive genomic relationship kernels in the Holstein data  but outperformed the latter in the wheat data. However  the difference in performance between the diffusion and Gaussian kernels was negligible. It is concluded that the ability of a diffusion kernel to capture the total genetic variance is not better than that of a Gaussian kernel  at least for these data. Although the diffusion kernel as a choice of basis function may have potential for use in whole-genome prediction  our results imply that embedding genetic markers into a non-Euclidean metric space has very small impact on prediction. Our results suggest that use of the black box Gaussian kernel is justified  given its connection to the diffusion kernel and its similar predictive performance. Prediction of yet-to-be observed phenotypes for complex quantitative traits in agricultural species[  ] or for disease status in medicine[] exploits connections between phenotypes  genealogies  and DNA variations potentially representing functional diversity of organisms. Systems biology approaches have uncovered abundant epistasis in model organisms  including the mouse and the rat[]  []  and []. In this context  Loewe[] proposed an evolutionary systems biology framework for arriving at a better understanding of molecular interactions  given that epistatic interactions between mutations are commonly observed. Therefore  it seems reasonable to argue that genotypes and phenotypes may be connected in forms that are not well addressed by the linear additive models that are standard in quantitative genetics. Bayesian regularized parametric linear additive smoothers  e.g. [  ] may not be fully adequate for capturing genetic signals under epistatic scenarios[  ]. Furthermore  attempts to account for epistasis by including interactions in a linear model produces a highly parameterized model structure  possibly yielding a poor predictive ability in cross-validation  and which does not scale well if high-order interactions are included in the model. Genetic risk prediction in medicine relies on using genomic information to predict the chance of contracting a disease  for example  in personalized medicine for preventive treatment and clinical health care. Prediction of genetic risk derived from pre-selected marker variants is mainstream in this domain  as opposed to prediction based on fitting whole-genome markers simultaneously  as done with great success in animal and plant breeding[–]. However  the variants detected in this way are typically not useful for genetic risk prediction  because they explain only a small fraction of the total genetic variance as estimated from covariances between relatives  for example using twin and family studies. Moreover  it has been shown that a large number of variants that do not reach genome-wide statistical significance contribute to the total additive genetic variance[]. Development of statistical models to predict phenotypic outcomes from all available molecular information that are capable of capturing complex genetic network architectures is therefore important. Arguably  a good predictive model should account for most of the genetic variability  as well as reflect the underlying genetic architecture properly. Also  a predictive model should be flexible with respect to type of input data  e.g.  high-throughput chip-based genotypes or whole-genome sequences  and mode of gene action. An appealing alternative is provided by a kernel-based parametric method known as BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) of genetic effects  developed in the 1950’s by C. R. Henderson  an animal breeder[]. BLUP can also be viewed as a regression of a phenotype on a pedigree-based relationship matrix  (when the model is additive)  and it has been used for genetic improvement of livestock species for decades. This method was recently extended to incorporate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) by replacing  by a genomic relationship matrix []  although there is no impediment to using  and  together[]. BLUP is suited for handling a massive amount of genetic information  because the computational burden can be proportional to the number of data points rather than the number of predictor variables (e.g.  markers)  and this is particularly true if a common weight is assigned to a each marker. Recently  kernel-based non-parametric models e.g. [–] have been proposed. A non-parametric treatment can accommodate nonlinear dependencies of phenotypes on predictor variables without explicitly modeling them. This suggests that these procedures can potentially pick up various forms of gene action without posing richly parametrized structures that require making strong distribution and genetic architecture assumptions a priori[  ]. For example  Long et al.[] used a computer simulation and found that the predictive ability of a non-parametric smoother was superior to that of a parametric linear counterpart when non-additive effects were strong. These authors also gave evidence that non-parametric smoothing is competitive to linear smoothing  even when additivity accounts for most of the total genetic variability. Kernel ridge regression[]  a kernel generalization of standard ridge regression[]  is also a non-parametric smoothing method. Ridge regression has received some attention in quantitative genetics in the context of mixed linear models[    –]  and the non-parametric version is carried out by constructing a spatial distance-based relationship matrix called kernel  as opposed to using additive genomic relationship kernels   or   which only embed correlations due to additive genetic effects. The choice of a kernel is equivalent to modeling covariance structure among individuals  and phenotypes are regressed on this kernel to obtain estimates of non-parametric regression coefficients. A simulation study[] found that in the presence of non-additive effects  a spatial distance-based kernel can outperform an additive genomic relationship kernel in predictive performance  but this has not been explored thoroughly with real data. Furthermore  while the set of all SNP genotype configurations on which a model is built is finite  past research has employed spatial distance-based kernels with infinite  unbounded domains  such as the Gaussian kernel. Our first objective in this study is to compare a spatial distance kernel with a non-spatial distance kernel. Secondly  we assess the performance of a non-Gaussian spatial distance kernel by deploying kernels on graphs as the choice of a basis function  a procedure that is suitable for discrete input data structures. Instead of encoding SNP data in a continuous Euclidean space  as in the case of the Gaussian kernel  we investigated kernels on a non-Euclidean space. We examined a diffusion kernel proposed by Kondor and Lafferty[]  Smola and Kondor[] and Lafferty and Lebanon[]  which is a kernel defined for functions on discrete spaces  such as a graph. A brief review on ’kernels on graphs’ is given by[]  and “graph kernels” are discussed in[]. As shown later  the diffusion kernel can be viewed as a discretization of the Gaussian kernel. We also tested the sensitivity of applying the same bandwidth parameter to autosomes and allosomes in the spatial distance kernels. This paper investigates the use of several kinds of kernels in a kernel ridge regression framework for genome-assisted prediction of quantitative traits. Two data sets representing dairy cattle and wheat were employed for this purpose. The paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section  we describe the data and introduce basic notions of kernel ridge regression. We then apply the diffusion kernel to strings of dummy variable marker sequences; the motivation of the non-Euclidean metric space is followed by an introduction of the diffusion kernel. In the next section  main results are presented. Finally  in the Discussion section  we address the implication of our results and make concluding remarks. Dairy cattle and wheat data were used. The dairy data was provided by the USDA-ARS Animal Improvement Programs Laboratory (Beltsville  MD) and represented 7902 Holstein bulls  each with 43 134 SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.025) spanning across the whole genome. The target response variable was progeny test predicted transmitting ability (PTA) of productive life (PL). PL is a measure of the observed length of time that a cow stays in the herd  from first calving to culling  and PTA is an estimate of half of the breeding value of a bull  which is a smoothed average assuming additive inheritance. PL is lowly heritable  with heritability estimated at 0.1[]. The genotype for each of 42 438 SNP loci on autosomes was coded as 0 (homozygous for allele “a”)  1 (heterozygous)  or 2 (homozygous for allele “A”)  according to the number of copies of the “A” allele. The remaining 696 loci on the X chromosome were coded as either 0 or 2  representing absence or presence of the “A” allele  respectively. Missing genotypes  due to either low call rates for some SNPs or poor DNA quality  were imputed via random sampling of genotypes with probabilities corresponding to observed genotype frequencies at each locus. Note that other more precise methods are available but were not used here. The wheat data included 599 inbred lines collected by the International Maize and Wheat improvement Center in Mexico (CIMMYT). Each line was genotyped with 1279 Diversity Array Technology (DArt) markers generated by Triticarte Pty. Ltd. These binary markers take the form of presence (1) or absence (-1). The phenotype here was average grain yield of each line in the first out of four environments represented in the data set  scaled to have zero mean and variance one. Missing genotypes were imputed as for the cattle data above. This data set has been also analyzed with support vector regression and neural network methods[  ]. Our goal is to predict an unobserved response y  for example PL in from a vector of genotypes  at a large number of SNP loci; when  SNP are considered   is in. To this end  we would like to establish a function mapping sequences of SNP genotypes onto the real line. A general setting is: where  is a response variable on case (=1 2 … )   is a ×1 vector of genotypes obtained on   () is a genetic effect interpretable as the conditional expectation function ()=(|=)  and  is a residual. We use kernel ridge regression to infer the unknown function   and select an appropriate kernel via a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions on  and optimize: with respect to   where the first term is the residual sum of squares  is the squared norm of  under a Hilbert space  and  is a regularization parameter. The representer theorem[] is used to find the optimal . In non-parametric regression  the search space is infinite  but the representer theorem allows confining the search to a specific set of functions. It has been shown[      ] that the optimizer will be in the span of the functions indexed by the observed covariates  and that the problem simplifies to optimization of: where ={( )=( )} is a × symmetric positive (semi) definite matrix;  is an unknown ×1 vector of non-parametric regression coefficients; and =   is the function that minimizes (1). By properties of a reproducing kernel   so that the function to be minimized with respect to  is: This is equivalent to writing: and then maximizing a penalized likelihood. This penalized likelihood is obtained by assuming that (|   2) and that  follows  where is the variance of the residuals  and is a variance component. Next  we review additive genomic relationship kernels and the Gaussian kernel  and then present how one can build a kernel on a graph with discrete inputs. Hereafter  we denote  as the kernel matrix indexed by the observed covariate; and ( ) indicates particular elements of ; is the infinite dimensional Gaussian kernel  or the 3×3 dimensional kernel for the diffusion kernel. Two types of additive genomic relationship kernels were tested in this study. First  an additive genomic relationship matrix ( ) was constructed following VanRaden[] as: where ={} is a × matrix of centered SNP marker codes  with the entry for  th individual and the  th marker taking the form Here  is the frequency of allele “A” computed from a base population. The denominator of   is a scaling parameter. In practice  the allele frequencies are estimated from the data at hand  but this yields semi-positive definite matrices as discussed by Strandén and Christensen[]. A second additive genomic relationship matrix ( ) was also as in VanRaden[] where  is a matrix of standardized genotypes[] with its  th column being where  is the  th column of  and  represents the number of SNPs. Since the Holstein data set led to non-positive   and   matrices because of numerical issues  (=1 2) was modified to  yielding  matrices that provided valid kernels. This may also avoid numerical instability in the eigenvalue decomposition of the kernel as explained later. The wheat data produced semi-positive definite genomic relationship kernel matrices. The kernel   has been applied to several inbred line populations in the past  e.g.  Ober et al.[]. In a Gaussian kernel  the distance between a pair ( ) of genotypes is represented as a squared Euclidean norm. Given a positive bandwidth parameter   the kernel takes the form where  and  ( =1 …  =1 … ) is the SNP genotype for individual  at SNP . A small Euclidean distance between two individuals reflects a strong similarity in state between their genotypes. On the one hand  as  increases  the kernel evaluation approaches ( )=0  producing a “sharp” or “local” kernel. On the other hand  as <U+2192>0  the kernel approaches 1  that is  a situation where the two individuals “match” perfectly  providing a “global” kernel. The SNP data on  loci on some individual often come as  which is clearly a discrete space  as there are 3 possible configurations of genotypes (not all of which are observable). Before defining the diffusion kernel  consider the meaning of ’diffusion on a graph’. Suppose =1  and consider a function  that measures the spread of ’influence’ of the genotype at this locus over the other possible genotypes by assuming that the ’influence’ diffuses like heat dissipates. Let  be the indicator function for genotype on. We call this the time 0 diffusion  since in this case has absolutely no influence on other genotypes; that is  the influence of does not diffuse out to its neighbors. Now  define the time  diffusion of the ’influence’ of genotype on genotype  to be: where  is a constant rate of diffusion and each summand is the differential gradient of the ’influence’ between genotypes  and . This is illustrated in Table. As stated above  there is no diffusion at =0. Subsequently  the time 1 diffusion with =0.1 when is computed as: As shown in Table  as  increases the ’influence’ spreads over all genotypes more evenly; also  the larger  is  the faster the diffusion is with respect to time . Writing (3) in vector form  with  we get: where  is a 3×3 identity matrix; is a constant 3×1 matrix of initial values  and with the first  second  and third rows of the  matrix corresponding to    and  respectively. The negative of this matrix is called the Laplacian of a graph G  given by: Let G be an undirected graph with vertex set (G). In general  the Laplacian of a graph G  (G)  is a (G) dimensional square matrix given by where  is an adjacency matrix and  is a diagonal matrix with. We can therefore generalize this ’diffusion’ for any graph G by using (G)=-(G). Under this definition  given any (G) dimensional vector   which shows that (G) is a negative semi-definite matrix. The most naive way of constructing a graph on is a Hamming graph. For the case =1  a Hamming graph is simply a complete graph of size 3  and has the form On this graph  the distance from genotype 0 (’’) to genotype 2 (’’) is the same as that from 0 (’’) to 1 (’  ’). Since genotype ’’ has no copies of the ’’ allele  it may be more reasonable to assume that genotype ’  ’ is closer to ’’  which has two copies of the ’A’ allele. This can be viewed from a mutational perspective as well. Genotype 0 (’’) requires two mutations to become genotype 2 (’’)  while genotype 1 (’  ’) requires only one mutation. Thus  the graph of interest would be given by (6). The latter is a path graph for SNP data  which will be taken as a minimal basis for our graph. In a path graph  all vertices are on a straight line  as in (6). A SNP grid of  loci is a  dimensional grid with vertices in  with two vertices  and  being adjacent if and only if For example  the graph below is the grid for 2 loci derived from the Cartesian graph product of two path graphs as in (6): The graph Laplacian for graph (8) is a square matrix of dimension 3×3: where the subscripts denote the vertices of graph (8). When there are  loci  the -dimensional grid graph has 3 vertices corresponding to sequences of genotypes  such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if just one SNP locus differs by 1. Now  suppose =3. The Cartesian graph product of (6) and (8) yields a 3 dimensional grid graph with 3 vertices  as shown in Figure. The diffusion kernel computes a similarity between two vertices on this graph  and projects this information into a more interpretable space.  A SNP grid graph with 3 genotypes ( = 3). It has 3=27 vertices. Consider now the continuous analog of the diffusion scheme above. This can be done by making ‘time’ or ‘space’ continuous  and ‘time’ will be made continuous first. Let =  (>0) and =1/. By using a small   we can achieve a discretization of the ‘diffusion time’ on a much finer scale  and the coefficient matrix is: If an infinitesimal scale is considered by taking <U+2192>0  (9) converges to: If a graph G with a Laplacian (G) is considered  then exp(- (G)) is called the diffusion kernel or heat kernel for graph G  where  is a rate of diffusion[]. Here  putting and taking the derivative with respect to  gives: which is a discrete diffusion equation (heat equation) on a graph with =-(G). Note that diffusion kernels always need to be associated with a graph. A Gaussian kernel is obtained by making this diffusion kernel “space” continuous. The connection between the two kernels is provided in Appendix A. When a graph G is large and asymmetric  the computation of the diffusion kernel can be extremely difficult. For instance  for a SNP grid with 43 134 loci  the dimension of is 3 by 3. However  symmetry helps. If a closed form of can be arrived at  there is no need to compute for all pairs of genotype sequences  . This is indeed the case for the Gaussian kernel  where the dimension of is infinite. With Kondor and Lafferty’s result given in[]  we may obtain the closed form of the diffusion kernel from the sample for our SNP grid. First  one needs to consider the Cartesian graph product for the diffusion kernel of a graph. Let and be the kernels for graphs G and G  respectively. The diffusion kernel for G=G<U+25A1>G is given by[]: where <U+25A1> denotes the Cartesian graph product and  is the tensor product (infinite dimensional Kronecker product). Consider a graph with one locus  G  with form 0-1-2. Then  we see that the diffusion kernel of the SNP grid on  loci with bandwidth parameter  is given by: To this end  we just need to compute with  in (5). With this result  one can create the  matrix for a SNP grid as follows. Let  and  be SNP data for  loci;  be the number of loci for which |- '|=  and  be the number of loci for which = '=1. In other words   is the number of loci at which two individuals differ by 1  and  is the number of loci at which two individuals share heterozygous states. Then: with proportionality constant (+3+2)  where =++. The last term is a contribution from heterozygosity. We refer to this as SNP grid kernel  specifically developed to model SNP data in this study. A proof of this result is given in Appendix B. Another diffusion kernel tailored for binary genotypes is required for the chromosome X of sires or for the wheat inbred lines. In this setting  instead of (6)  the path graph for one locus (=1) is: and the corresponding graph Laplacian is given by: as opposed to (5). For two loci (=2)  the Cartesian product of graphs G(0-2) and G(0-2) yields the graph: where the first digits (G) and the second digits (G). Then  the associated graph Laplacian is: where the subscripts denote the rows and columns of vertices of graph (15). Specifically  we compute = exp( ) with  defined in (14) and perform the tensor product  times. With this  the kernel is given by: where ( ) is the Hamming distance  that is  number of coordinates at which  and  differ[]. Following Kondor and Lafferty[]  this diffusion kernel for binary markers will be referred to as the hypercube kernel. In addition in the Holstein data  we combined the two kernels derived from autosomes and from chromosome X to see the influence of applying the same value of the bandwidth parameter to different types of chromosomes. This is given by: where  is a Hadamard product of matrices. In general  given a set of  individuals  we may partition SNP into several subsets  say =(  .... ). If  is the diffusion kernel corresponding to subset   then the diffusion kernel for all sets can be computed as: This result also holds for the Gaussian kernel  but not necessarily for every kernel  e.g.  the exponential kernel defined with the Euclidean distance (||-||) does not hold this property. Once the choice of the kernel is determined  (2) can be maximized by taking the derivative of () with respect to  to obtain: where  is a regularization parameter. Here  implementation of kernel ridge regression was cast in a Bayesian framework with  where and are the residual variance and the variance attached to  respectively. Then  note that[  ]: This is proportional to  that is  the posterior density of  (given and) for the linear model: with (0    2) and with prior (0   2). Minimizing () will maximize  so is the conditional posterior mode of . One may change the basis  using the eigenvalue decomposition =  where  is the matrix of eigenvectors of  and  is a diagonal matrix in which diagonals are the eigenvalues  as shown in de los Campos et al.[]  such that  for = one gets  in a fully Bayesian model  Once a prior is assigned to and  a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) scheme can be used to infer all unknown parameters  including . Scaled inverse chi-square prior distributions were assigned to and  each with 3 degrees of freedom and a scale parameter equal to 1. Samples from posterior distributions were obtained by the Gibbs sampler in[]  and each of the analyses was based on 100 000 MCMC samples with the first 60 000 samples discarded as burn-in. After burn-in  samples were thinned at a rate of 10  resulting in 4000 mildly correlated samples for posterior inference. Convergence was monitored by inspecting trace plots of the variance parameters. A bandwidth parameter  yielding high predictive ability is needed as well. However  sampling of the bandwidth parameter in MCMC sampling requires computation of kernels at each iteration  which is very demanding given the number of individuals and SNP considered in our study. For this reason  evaluation of the diffusion kernel was performed over a fixed grid of values of . The range of  considered provided average values of that were evenly spaced  approximately  between 0.13 to 0.99. Computation of kernels and Gibbs sampling was carried out in Fortran and in R  respectively. The predictive ability of RKHS models with either a diffusion kernel or a Gaussian kernel was assessed by cross-validation. A subset of 5403 bulls born from 1952 through 2003 was used as the training set for the Holstein data. A testing set of 2499 bulls born from 2004 through 2006 was used to evaluate predictive ability. For the wheat data  a 10 fold cross-validation scheme was applied by assigning 599 lines randomly to one of 10 disjoint subsets. Each set was used for validation in turn  while the other 9 subsets were used to train the model. To illustrate  we estimated  in the Holstein data using the training set =(  ) and their corresponding SNP genotypes     and then predicted responses in the testing set as: where is the 2499 × 1 vector of predicted responses of bulls in the testing set;  is a 2499×1 vector of ones; is the posterior mean of the intercept estimated from the training set;  is a 2499 × 5403 matrix with elements ( ) representing the allelic similarity between bulls in the testing (=1 … 2499) and training (=1 … 5403) sets  with the same bandwidth parameter employed in the training set  and is the vector of posterior means of 5403 non-parametric regression coefficients obtained from the training set. In the equation above   was either the diffusion or the Gaussian kernel. In a Bayesian setting  however  one can embed all the above steps in a convenient way. Prior to Gibbs sampling  first we construct a full kernel matrix containing both training and testing data sets. We treat the responses of testing set individuals as unobserved  and these values are predicted via a predictive distribution. This is easy to incorporate in the Gibbs sampling scheme. Pearson’s correlation between the predicted values (mean of the predictive distribution) and the observed PTA  Cor(  and predictive mean-squared error (MSE) defined as were computed to evaluate the predictive ability of the two kernels. Here  is the mean of the predictive distribution of response  in the testing data set  which is the  th element of the. To illustrate the effect of the bandwidth parameter () on the SNP grid kernel  Figure contains histograms showing how  controls similarities among individuals based on evaluating the kernel on the SNP data. The larger  is  the stronger the prior inter-correlation structure. It is important to note that the diagonal elements in our SNP grid kernel matrices are not necessarily equal to one  as opposed to what happens in a Gaussian kernel; here   is a correlation matrix. Table shows the average of diagonal  ( )  and off-diagonal  ( )  elements for diffusion  Gaussian and two additive genomic relationship kernels at varying bandwidth values. The mean values of the diagonal elements of the four diffusion kernels shown in Figure (see Table) were 0.369  0.693  0.874  and 0.952 for =10 11 12  and 13  respectively. This is because in equation ()  even when =  so that ==0   (the number of ‘Aa’ genotypes shared by  and ) may not be zero. This implies that our diffusion kernel accounts for the degree of heterozygosity in a sample. From the perspective of the kernel as a smoothing function  the diffusion kernel performs smoothing for all elements based on heterozygosity as well as allelic similarity. As explained below  the larger the heterozygosity  the weaker the smoothing  leading to a smaller penalty; this is not the case  however  in the Gaussian kernel. In the kernel computation  each factor in (13) is < 1  and in particular  the factor corresponding to  is the largest. Henceforth  if the sample contains few heterozygotes  our  will be large. Consequently  the penalty from the optimizer function    will tend to be large. This is interpretable as imposing stronger smoothing for samples with low heterozygosity. As for the “correlation” with itself  an individual with low heterozygosity will have diagonal elements close to one  as in the case of a Gaussian kernel. Therefore  in addition to the ‘distance’ between genotypes of two individuals  the diffusion kernel takes into account the extent of heterozygosity  while the Gaussian kernel incorporates only the former. Also  the two kernels differ in their definition of distance. The diffusion kernel on the SNP grid is based on the Manhattan distance  while the Gaussian kernel is defined on the Euclidean distance. The Manhattan distance is the distance between two points measured by the the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.  Histograms of lower triangular elements of four diffusion kernels based on four different bandwidth parameters (). As shown in Table  the average of off-diagonal elements of the diffusion kernel was smaller than that of diagonal elements. This is because the first two terms of (13) will be different from zero ( >0) for a pair of individuals. Diffusion kernel evaluations between an individual and itself were always larger than kernels evaluated between pairs  that is  diagonal elements had the largest values for each row of . In the Gaussian kernel  diagonal elements are always equal to 1 and a smaller  value produces a stronger prior correlation. The first type of additive genomic relationship kernel ( ) had the average diagonal and off-diagonal elements close to 1 and 0  respectively  as expected. Similarly    had an average off-diagonal close to 0 but it had smaller average diagonal elements than those of  . The right-most columns of Table give the evaluation of predictive ability of the kernels measured as the correlation between predicted values and observed PTA  and MSE of prediction  for several different bandwidth parameters (  and   do not involve this parameter). The predictive correlation of the diffusion (SNP grid) kernel was best at  = 11  while with the Gaussian kernel this was achieved at  = 10. Although the averages of diagonal and off-diagonal elements varied substantially with different bandwidth parameters in the diffusion and Gaussian kernels  the influence of this variability on predictive correlations was small. Importantly  no major difference was observed between the diffusion and the Gaussian kernels in terms of predictive performance. Differences among kernels were very minor  probably due to the fact that the response (PTA) is already a smoothed mean based on a large number of daughters of each bull. There was consistency between the correlation and the MSE  in the sense that the value of  with the highest predictive correlation had the smallest MSE. Predictive performance of   was only slightly worse than that of the spatial distance kernels with the best bandwidth parameters. Values in parentheses in Table were obtained by combining the SNP grid kernel from autosomes and the hypercube kernel from allosomes by applying the same bandwidth parameter. Incorporation of X-chromosome information reduced the average off-diagonal elements slightly and deteriorated predictive performance to some extent. The average diagonal and off-diagonal elements remained the same in   and    but a minor reduction in their predictive abilities was observed. In the wheat data  the superiority of the spatial distance-based kernels over the additive genomic relationship kernels was clear. Table indicates that the diffusion and Gaussian kernels had the best predictive correlations (MSE) at 0.586 (0.685) and 0.582 (0.686)  respectively  whereas those of   and   were 0.518 (0.709) and 0.521 (0.708). This is likely due to picking up non-additive genetic variation that this wheat data harbors. With binary markers  the diagonal elements of the diffusion kernel are always 1  since in equation () the Hamming distance ( ) is always zero. As with the Holstein data  no apparent difference was observed between the diffusion and the Gaussian kernels. Arguably  relationships between phenotypes and genotypes may be non-linear and complex[    ]. For this reason  ignoring non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis in a model may lead to inferior predictive ability of individual phenotypes. A spatial distance-based kernel non-parametric regression is capable of mapping genotypes to phenotypes in a way that accurately reflects underlying  albeit unknown  relationships. These kernel methods incorporate non-linearity of a predictor set  through a nonlinear transformation of   subsequently allowing analysis of the response in terms of features () in a linear way. This is particularly useful when the response has a linear relationship with respect to the parameters  but is non-linear on covariates  such as in the case of polynomial regression. The predictive ability of kernel-based genetic models depends on the choice of a kernel and associated bandwidth parameter(s). If the two data points lie in the real line   it seems reasonable to compute their distance in terms of Euclidean distance. However  SNP genotypes  coded as dummy variables  take a discrete form. Therefore  it may be worthwhile to consider a kernel designed to capture the discrete structure of the input variables. The best predictive kernel and its performance may vary depending on the underlying genetic architecture  quantitative trait loci (QTL) numbers and distribution of effects  data set used  and kernel method applied. Here  we investigated the use of ridge regression with a diffusion kernel to assess if this would enhance predictive ability over that of the Gaussian kernel and two additive genomic relationship counterparts. Kondor and Lafferty[] obtained promising results when the diffusion kernel was compared with several kernels in classification problems with a set of discrete predictors  and this kernel has been used in a microarray-based gene function prediction problem[]. Ober et al.[] used the Matérn covariance function  which contains the Gaussian and the exponential kernel as particular cases. Therein  the smoothing parameter controls the actual form of a kernel  and this is directly driven by sample data. Although they obtained a Gaussian form as a choice of the covariance function  the Matérn function is bounded by the Euclidean norm by definition  which may not be suited for discrete genomic data. A strength of kernels for structured data is their ability to address similarities between two data points[]. The diffusion kernel defines the distance between two data points on graphs  namely vertices  and projects this information into a more interpretable space. As shown in the context of modeling linkage disequilibrium[]  various graph structures can be used to represent sets of discrete random variables  such as genotypes. Coupled with the representer theorem  the diffusion kernel allows casting underlying graph structures into a regression on the real line under a Hilbert space. The main idea behind this kernel is the matrix exponentiation of the graph Laplacian. The -dimensional grid graph with vertices representing a vector of genotypes was chosen for the graph structure. Each grid conveys information on similarity in terms of the Manhattan distance. Two vertices  and are connected if for all   except at one coordinate. In the Holstein data  with =7902 and  = 42 438  it is unlikely that any of two vertices present in our data are connected. However  what grid graphs embrace is how many “steps” separate a vector of genotypes observed in individual  from an observed vector of genotypes in individual . The diffusion kernel and its associated graph structure are free of parametric structures. They are constructed without posing genetic architecture assumptions a priori. For illustration purposes  we used 0  1  and 2 for allele coding  but these should be interpreted as mere strings. Kernel computation still remains the same no matter what allele coding method is adopted here. The parametric component in our study is the construction of the path graph in equation ()  but it is not relevant to gene action modes. This allows us to build a flexible non-parametric model without making strong assumptions a priori. This is appealing  because we seldom know the underlying genetic architectures of complex traits. As shown in past studies including animals[] and plants[]  a non-parametric method stands out when prediction of phenotypes is the primal focus. Our motivation for applying the diffusion kernel stemmed from the assumption that a non-Euclidean distance may be able to more clearly represent genomic similarities. We carried out a matrix exponentiation of two graph Laplacians created from two path graphs (one for SNP and one for binary markers) for this purpose. This yields a kernel based on the Manhattan distance accounting for the heterozygosity that two individuals share. The two spatial distance kernels resulted in better predictive performance than the two additive genomic relationship kernels in the wheat data. This agrees with the previous simulation study of Ober et al.[]  in which the Gaussian kernel outperformed   in the presence of non-additive effects. Superiority of the spatial distance kernels was less obvious in the Holstein data. This may be due to the phenotype we chose for this study  since the PTA response variable is a smoothed average using linear mixed models. Although the differences were small in cattle  two non-parametric kernels applied in this study outperformed the additive relationship kernels in two of the datasets used. This suggests that unknown cryptic genetic architectures are likely to be intrinsic to complex traits and  hence  kernels that can accommodate such structure yielded better predictions. As for the difference between the diffusion and the Gaussian kernels in terms of predictive ability  the diffusion kernel had the highest predictive correlation and the lowest MSE with =11 in the Holstein data  but the difference with the Gaussian kernel was negligible. The same result was seen in the wheat data. This implies that the Gaussian kernel is robust  even if it incorporates genotypes on the real line such as 1.25 or -12.3. Our objective to properly incorporate genotypes into a kernel had a small impact on predictive ability of yet-to-be observed phenotypes. Although the distance between genotypes is certainly not continuous  additional efforts to discretize the Euclidean distance may not be needed. Another possible reason might be that genotypes do not reside in the Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces explored here  but in a manifold[]. Incorporation of X chromosome genotypes for building a kernel led to a smaller average diagonal and off-diagonal elements (to some extent) in spatial distance kernels  but no change was observed in the additive genomic relationship kernels. In both types of spatial distance kernels  however  the predictive correlations were worse than when kernels were constructed purely from autosomes. This suggests that applying specific bandwidth parameters to autosomes and allosomes in the spatial distance kernels might be important. A similar decline in predictive performance was observed in the two additive genomic relationship kernels  which do not involve any bandwidth parameter. Further research is needed to investigate what produces this drop in predictive performance  although if no markers contribute to PL on chromosome X  this would add extra noise. To our knowledge  this study involves one of the largest data sets employed for spatial kernel-based genome-enabled selection of agricultural species. The challenge here was computation of the diffusion kernel  rather than the Gibbs sampler. Approximately  it took four days to compute one diffusion kernel on a Linux workstation equipped with the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5450 3.00GHz and 16GB of RAM. The Gaussian kernel required slightly less time for building  but with several candidates over a grid of values of the bandwidth parameter   this was an expensive task for both kernels. One useful approach might be that of multiple kernel learning (MKL)[  ]  which uses a few kernels with different covariance structure in a single RKHS model. Finally  the SNP grid graph and the hypercube graph used in this study are naive graph structures for modeling discrete inputs. Perhaps developing a graph structure that is more suitable for SNP data might increase predictive correlations. We investigated the performance of a diffusion kernel  which was specifically developed to model discrete marker inputs  using Holstein cattle and wheat data. On the one hand  the predictive ability of the diffusion kernel was similar to that of non-spatial distance-based additive genomic relationship kernels in the Holstein data  due to the fact that the response (PTA) is already a smoothed mean based on a large number of daughters of each bull  but outperformed the latter in the wheat data. On the other hand  only minor difference was observed between the diffusion and the Gaussian kernels in terms of predictive performance. Although the diffusion kernel as a choice of basis function may have potential for use in whole-genome prediction  the results of this study suggest that the simple Gaussian kernel is robust enough  and that the scope for enhancing predictive ability via kernel refinement may be limited. Intuitively  consider again (4) with a one locus case. In order to make the space continuous  an infinite number of ‘fake’ genotypes between and outside of 0 and 2 are needed. That is  instead of the discrete graph 0-1-2  the interval between 0 and 2  and also outside of it  will be viewed as a ‘continuous’ graph containing genotypes such as 1.23 or -10.5  for example. While the fundamental structure of the graph remains the same  each genotype is connected only to its immediate neighbors  that is  each genotype  is connected to only two genotypes  +  and -  for some infinitesimal . Then   in (5) becomes an infinite-dimensional matrix  and ( ) is -2 for = and 1 for +   -   because each genotype is connected to its neighboring genotypes on both sides. With the vector of genotypes being now infinite-dimensional  =(-  -   +   )  define a function  that returns an “influence” of genotypes  =((-)  (- ) () (+ )  ()). Approximating  by   it can be seen that: where is the second derivative of  evaluated at . Thus  with space continuity   acts like a second derivative[]. Using this analogy back in (11)  we get: This equation is called the continuous diffusion equation: the first derivative in “time” is equal to the second derivate in “space”. The solution to this partial differential equation (PDE) with a Dirac delta[] initial condition of concentration on =0  ()=1  is given by: This is a Gaussian density in a one-dimensional space where is the variance of the distribution. With the initial condition ()=()  the solution to this PDE is: where ( )=(-) is called a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth . Thus  the Gaussian kernel is the ‘space’ continuous analogue of the diffusion kernel as described on the graph. This analogy works exactly the same in higher dimensions. Consider a graph with one locus  G; this graph has form 0-1-2. We compute exp( ) where exponentiation is defined as the Taylor expansion (10)  differing from componentwise exponentiation. For G   is given by: We make use of the eigendecomposition of matrix      and take note of the fact that = . Plugging this  in (10)  we obtain exp( )= exp( ). Here exp( ) becomes simple componentwise exponentiation because  is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. For this specific matrix  Thus  the kernel for a one-dimensional grid graph is: Taking the exponential of eigenvalues always yields a positive real value  so if  is symmetric  exp( ) is positive definite  suggesting that the diffusion kernel is a valid kernel. Expression (18) is symmetric and in particular  Computing every entry of is computationally unfeasible and unnecessary. We only need to compute entries corresponding to the pair of genotypes appearing in the sample. In particular  if ( ) is the contribution of the  th locus  then: where is determined by the relationship between  and  and can take only one of the four values specified above. Thus we can write as: where  is the indicator function. Therefore  This can be simplified by using the fact that: so that: Note that one does not need to count .

This paper reviews the literature on epigenetic mechanisms that could contribute significantly to trait variability in birds  and compares the results to the existing knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in mammals. The main issues addressed in this paper are: (1) Does genomic imprinting exist in birds? (2) How does the embryonic environment influence the adult phenotype in avian species? (3) Does the embryonic environment have an impact on phenotypic variability across several successive generations? The potential for epigenetic studies to improve the performance of individual animals through the implementation of limited changes in breeding conditions or the addition of new parameters in selection models is still an open question. Most economically relevant traits in animal production exhibit continuous phenotypic variations due to polygenic and environmental factors. Whereas many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for agronomic traits  in most cases  the underlying genes remain largely unknown. Genome-wide association studies have shown that  except for rare monogenic traits  the variability of complex traits is only partially explained by genetic variation[]. Possible explanations include epistatic effects  structural variations  and insufficient detection power due to lack of individuals or markers[  ]. Both epidemiological studies in humans and genetic studies in animals have revealed that  in addition to the DNA sequence  epigenetic marks may be transmitted across generations and influence the phenotype of offspring[]. There are many discussions in the literature on what the term “epigenetics” refers to and this leads to numerous definitions[–]. While some definitions restrict epigenetics to modifications of the phenotype without changes of the DNA sequence that are transmitted to the next generations[]  other broader definitions include any form of information storage that maintains the DNA sequence intact  as described by Bird: \"the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register  signal or perpetuate altered activity states\"[]. The former definitions link the term \"epigenetic\" to inheritance and the latter also refer to any phenomenon that leads to phenotypic plasticity. These two visions share a common feature i.e. the molecular mechanisms involved. The epigenetic machinery encompasses chromatin folding and its attachment to the nuclear matrix  packaging of DNA around nucleosomes  covalent modifications of histone tails  DNA methylation  and regulatory non coding RNA (such as miRNA  snoRNA  lncRNA). Epigenetic marks have been shown to actively contribute to the determination of patterns of gene silencing or active transcription  and to participate in the lineage and tissue-specific expression of genes[–]. Epigenetic marks are heritable from cell to cell through lineage development  and when acquired in early life  they can have an impact on the adult phenotype. They can also have an impact on the phenotypes of subsequent generations through multigenerational effects that occur either via epigenetic changes acquired during embryonic development  or through the inheritance of epigenetic marks via the gametes[  ]. In this review  we retain the definition given by Feil and Fraga[]: “Epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence”. Understanding the epigenetic regulation of gene expression due to environmental factors should provide important new insights into animal breeding  since the same genetic information may be used differently by individuals grown in different environments. However  epigenetic regulation of gene expression is not always environment-dependent as for parental imprinting in which parent-of-origin-specific expression of a subset of genes is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Examples of such loci have been documented in livestock species i.e. the locus responsible for the callipyge phenotype in sheep[] and the locus that controls  expression in pigs[]. The first agricultural species to be fully sequenced was the chicken  however  to date  there are few studies on the relation between epigenetic processes and economically important phenotypes in birds. This review focuses on how epigenetic phenomena can have an impact on the adult phenotype of farmed birds. The importance of sex-linked genes that account for some of the phenotypic variability has been shown in the chicken[] and X inactivation that involves epigenetic mechanisms is well known in mammals[  ]. In birds  only partial dosage compensation between the hetero- (ZW  female) and homogametic (ZZ  male) sexes has been described[  ] and this was previously known as \"lack of global dosage compensation\"[]. A region of hypermethylation (MHM for Male Hypermethylated Region []) is associated with dosage-compensation of several genes in the male chicken[–]  but not in zebra finch[]. Many questions about the mechanisms of regional dosage-compensation still remain[  ]. Since this topic has already been extensively reviewed  we refer the reader to the literature  including the references given above. By contrast  little is known about the mechanisms of genomic imprinting  if present  or developmental programming in birds although they may play a role in phenotypic variability as shown in mammalian farm animals. Similarly  epigenetic information that can be transmitted through several generations could have a significant impact on animal selection. This review addresses the following questions: (1) Are there molecular mechanisms leading to genomic imprinting in birds? (2) While the influence of fetal environment on adult phenotypes is largely documented in mammals  what are the developmental and metabolic phenotypes due to specific environmental cues in birds? (3) Are there examples indicating that embryonic environment has multigenerational effects in birds? To discuss the state of knowledge regarding genomic imprinting in birds  the mechanisms known in mammals will be compared to the information available in avian species. To date  among vertebrates  genomic imprinting has been described only in eutherian mammals and marsupials. Parental imprinting (Figure )  a process that leads to the differential expression of alleles depending on their parental origin (see[] for a review)  is stage- and tissue-specific[  ]. The major theory explaining genomic imprinting is the parental conflict hypothesis[  ]  which states that the genes responsible for controlling the supply of maternal resources have a parentally biased expression  with the maternal genome tending to restrain resource allocations to preserve the mother and future progeny  while the paternal genome tends to facilitate this allocation to produce stronger offspring. Based on this theory  it can be assumed that genomic imprinting is restricted to organisms in which the maternal resources affect directly the embryonic genes  and thus its existence would be unlikely in oviparous animals[].  Each chromosome pair of an offspring consists of a maternal chromosome (in red) and a paternal chromosome (in blue). In this example  the offspring resulting from the cross expresses only its maternal allele (red)  since the paternally inherited allele is inactive. In avian species  important reciprocal effects involving asymmetry in the contributions of the sire and dam to the offspring phenotype have been described for some traits. They explain 15 to 20% of the phenotypic variability in broiler body weight and egg viability in layers  and up to 47% in turkey egg production  and they have been extensively used to improve production in layers by designing optimized mating schemes[]. These effects are mainly due to sex-linked genes  underlying the importance of chromosome Z in epigenetic effects  direct maternal effects (\"larger females produce larger eggs\") or mitochondrial DNA transmission[]. However  this does not exclude the hypothesis that some of these effects may originate from parent-of-origin preferential allelic expression[  ]  and efforts to identify the genes involved in quantitative traits are increasingly taking epistatic and epigenetic effects into account. In the chicken and quail  many parent-of-origin QTL have been detected for traits linked with production[–]  immune responses[] and behavior[]. However  such studies can detect spurious QTL due to linkage disequilibrium or bias generated by the experimental design[  ]. A study reported by Rowe et al.[] was specifically designed to avoid these biases i.e. it included a sufficient number of sires and dams to ensure segregation and a sufficient number of offspring to detect QTL with roughly equal allele frequencies in sires and dams for both QTL and molecular markers  and it fitted the common maternal environment in the linear model. Interestingly  this work confirmed the presence of a parent-of-origin QTL on chicken chromosome 1  in a region corresponding to orthologous imprinted regions in the human and mouse genomes. These results confirm the importance of studying genomic imprinting in birds. Several studies have clearly demonstrated that some genes are paternally or maternally expressed during embryonic development in mammals[–]. Until recently  less than 200 imprinted genes were described () but a transcriptome sequencing approach reported in 2010[] uncovered parent-of-origin allelic effects for more than 1300 loci in the mouse. However  this large number is the subject of much debate[  ]  and to date  no consensus on the number of imprinted genes in mammals has been reached. Some genes  known to be imprinted in mammals  have been examined in non eutherian vertebrates  in particular oviparous species[]  including birds  viviparous marsupials[]  and monotremes[  ]. The  gene  which has long been known to be paternally expressed in the mouse and man[]  has also been analyzed in the chicken. A preliminary report suggested that its expression is probably monoallelic[]  but later studies agreed that it is in fact biallelic[  –]. In this case  analyses of different chicken tissues and at different growth stages led to divergent conclusions  emphasizing the importance of tissue sampling and time scaling in imprinting studies. The orthologs of other genes known to be imprinted in mammals  such as / (a fully imprinted region in mammals)  /   and  were found to be biallelically expressed in the chicken[–]. Moreover  the  imprinting center identified in mammals and controlling an imprinted cluster that includes   appears to be absent in the chicken[]. However  such studies are limited to few genes (less than 5% of the genes known to be imprinted in the mouse) in different chicken embryonic tissues at different developmental stages. They are not sufficiently exhaustive to conclude that imprinting does not exist in birds  especially since different sets of genes might be imprinted in mammals versus birds. Several studies have examined imprinted-related molecules and phenomena to better understand genomic imprinting in mammals. If applied to the chicken  this approach may also help test for the existence of genomic imprinting in birds. One feature of imprinted regions in mammals is the asynchronous replication of parental alleles[]. Interestingly  replication of the chicken orthologs of some imprinted genes is asynchronous[]  even when they are biallelically expressed. It is hypothesized that mammalian imprinted gene clusters originate from an ancestor common to all vertebrates and that they evolved from preimprinted to imprinted regions[]. Since the orthologous mammalian imprinted genes are biallelically expressed in the chicken  it is impossible to strictly link the asynchronous replication to imprinting in birds. Another feature of mammalian imprinting is its association with several molecular signatures. As recently reviewed  these signatures need to differentiate paternal and maternal inherited chromosomes in order to influence transcription  and to be transmitted through generations[]. Changes in DNA methylation patterns represent an ideal mechanism to generate such signatures or epigenetic marks. DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression  and specific methylation patterns can be inherited across generations in mammals. The enzymes that control DNA methylation  such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)  are crucial for embryonic survival in the mouse (recently reviewed in[  ]). DNMT include proteins that act in the maintenance of DNA methylation  such as DNMT1  and proteins that are involved in  DNA methylation  either by directly interacting with DNA (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) or indirectly as supporting factors (DNMT3L)[–]. The respective roles of DNMT in genomic imprinting have been brought to light mainly through loss-of-function (knockdown or knockout) experiments[  ]. Identification of methylation-related DNMT in chickens would stimulate the search for allele-specific expression in oviparous animals.    and  cDNA have been cloned in the chicken  and their encoded proteins have been shown to share 50-80% amino acid identities with the corresponding mouse orthologs[  ]. However    a gene that encodes a protein essential for the establishment of imprinted marks in the mouse[] has not been detected in birds[]  which may explain why some genes imprinted in mammals are not imprinted in the chicken. Another approach for investigating genomic imprinting is to explore the chicken genome for differentially methylated regions (DMR) that are involved in the differential methylation of maternal and paternal chromosomal DNA in mammalian imprinting. A genome-wide methylome map of chicken muscle and liver tissues was completed recently[]  and the authors did not identify any DMR associated with genes known to be imprinted in mammals. However  this search was performed for only a few genes in two tissues  and thus it is difficult to draw conclusions on the existence of imprinted genes across the chicken genome. Although methylation patterns play a major role in the process of allele silencing  other mechanisms (e.g.  histone modifications or non-coding RNA) are also known to be involved at several stages[–]. Among the numerous studies on this subject  two deserve particular attention. First  a study on mouse placenta has shown that genetic ablation of DNA methylation does not suppress imprinting of paternally repressed genes located in the distal region of mouse chromosome 7[] but that histone methylation seems sufficient to confer a silenced status to the paternal alleles of the relevant genes. The authors suggest the existence of an older imprinting mechanism that is limited to extra-embryonic tissues and that involves histone modification. In the second study  the authors examined the mouse  cluster (located on mouse chromosome 2  containing a gene coding for stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit  giving rise to alternatively spliced isoforms that show maternal-  paternal- and biallelic expression as well as a non-coding antisense transcript[]). They demonstrated that   a non-coding RNA  could silence  by a mechanism independent of a DNA methylation mark[]. Again  a DNA-methylation-independent role of chromatin marks in gene silencing was highlighted. These two studies show that imprinting mechanisms other than DNA methylation exist  and it is interesting to note that such mechanisms have not yet been investigated in birds. Genome-wide approaches[    ] and developments such as next-generation sequencing have recently opened up new perspectives for the investigation of imprinting mechanisms  including the possibility of identifying unknown mechanisms and gaining insight into new interactions or alternative processes. As suggested in a recent review[]  it is essential to explore other vertebrate lineages for epigenetic marks and allele-specific expression. The environment can influence developmental plasticity and thus phenotypes in a wide variety of animals  from insects to man[]. Environmental epigenomics refers to the study of how environmental exposures (e.g.  toxins  stress or maternal nutrition) during early development influence gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms (e.g.  DNA methylation or histone modifications) that  in turn  influence the adult phenotype[  –]. As described below  the environment may have a much broader impact on the adult phenotype when the marks occur early during development. Several studies on DNA and histone methylation levels in chicks subjected to heat stimulation demonstrated that epigenetic marks vary with the environmental conditions experienced during the post-hatch period[–]. They showed that the expression of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)  which is a key regulator of thermotolerance acquisition in the chick hypothalamus  differs between control birds and animals acclimated to heat early in their post-hatch life. Furthermore  alterations were observed in the methylation level of CpG sites in the promoter of the  gene. It was also shown that modifications of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and methylation of histone H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27) in the promoter of  occur in the hypothalamus during thermotolerance acquisition on day 3 post-hatch. Epigenetic modifications are involved in the immune mechanisms underlying chicken susceptibility to [] or Marek disease[  ] and include changes in the DNA methylation pattern of host defense genes. Indeed  the Marek disease virus (MDV) can induce changes in the expression levels of all three  genes (    and ). Various histone profiles and gene promoters were identified as being differentially modified and methylated in MDV-sensitive and -resistant chicken strains  indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may participate in the modulation of the resistance and/or susceptibility to specific poultry diseases[  ]. Other environmental changes are known to affect the adult phenotype  but to date  no molecular evidence of epigenetic phenomena is available. For instance  phosphorus- or calcium-restricted diets during the early growing period trigger a compensatory adaptation of the chicken[]  possibly mediated by epigenetic mechanisms[]. Although little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms in birds  it seems that feed stress may alter gene transcription at least partly via epigenetic mechanisms. For example  Xu et al.[] reported that 3-day-old chicks subjected to a 24-hour fasting underwent histone H3 methylation modifications in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus  which is the center of body temperature and food intake control. In addition to post-hatch environmental factors  changes applied directly to the egg or the resources contained in the egg (e.g.  nutrients  hormones  carotenoids  vitamins or RNA transcripts) can have an impact on newborn fitness and later on the adult phenotype[  ]. Thus  these environmental effects on development are either directly applied to the embryo itself  or are transmitted by the mother. In birds  direct abiotic environmental factors (e.g.  temperature) can influence embryonic development and the adult phenotype (see[]). It has been shown that exposure of embryos to different temperatures at the end of egg incubation  which is a critical developmental period  can be a way of adapting poultry embryos to later climatic conditions (see[]). Epigenetic processes are good candidates for mediating these mechanisms[–]. Another example of abiotic stress influencing embryonic development is the exposure to green monochromatic LED light during embryogenesis that has a growth-promoting effect observed on adult turkeys and broiler chickens[–]. One explanation may be enhanced proliferation and differentiation of adult myoblasts and myofiber synchronization[]  but further work is needed to better characterize the underlying processes. The impact of the mother’s environment on the F1 generation phenotype has been well documented in mammals. For example  it has been reported in humans  that the gestational diet affects offspring phenotypes (part of the \"nutritional programming\") (see[]). A well-documented example comes from studies after the Dutch famine during World War II  which revealed that prenatal under-nutrition had an effect on later health[] and that epigenetic mechanisms were involved[]. The resulting chronic degenerative diseases associated with this famine include cardiovascular diseases  metabolic diseases  breast cancer and obesity. Another famous example of an adult phenotype induced by maternal nutrition in mammals is the viable yellow agouti (A) mouse model  in which the  gene is genetically and epigenetically dysregulated by an upstream retrotransposon insertion. In this model  the diet of the mother influences coat color and other pleiotropic outcomes  such as diabetes  obesity and tumorigenesis in the offspring. Both methylation patterns and histone modifications are involved in the epigenetic variations of this mutation[  ]. Maternal under-nutrition can also affect the phenotype of offspring in birds. For example  Rao et al. showed that 4-week-old chicks from mothers fed a low-protein diet had significantly heavier body weight and  muscle weight[]. Another approach consists in experimentally increasing brood size  which induces developmental deficits (including nutrient deficits) in the early life of birds. For example  in zebra finches  Naguib et al.[  ] imposed different degrees of developmental stress on nestlings by forming broods ranging in size from two to six nestlings  and then examined the offspring of the dams that had been differentially stressed as nestlings. As the brood size experienced by the dams increased  the weight of their offspring decreased. The effects on body mass and size were sex-specific. Female offspring grew larger than male offspring when their dam was raised in a small brood  but females from dams reared in large broods were smaller than their brothers. Furthermore  the reproductive success of the female progeny was negatively associated with the brood size in which the dam was raised[  ]. These maternal effects could result from modifications in egg content of the females that were stressed during their early development  leading to sex-dependent impacts on the phenotype of F1 individuals. Epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in this process  and deserve to be examined in this context. Several studies have also proven the existence of a maternal influence on the immune system of F1 individuals in birds (see[] for a review). From a genetic point of view  it is interesting that the priming effect of these induced responses seems to depend on the maternal genetic background[]. The most in-depth research on epigenetic effects in birds over a single generation focused on the effects of environmental challenges on behavioral traits  gene expression and DNA methylation in offspring[–]. In one of these studies[]  spatial learning was affected in individuals subjected to unpredictable light rhythms compared to animals exposed to predictable light rhythms. In the White Leghorn but not the Red Jungle Fowl  these effects were transmitted to the F1 generation reared under normal conditions  indicating a difference in the transmission of information to the next generation between these two chicken breeds. Exposure of commercial chicks to an unpredictable light schedule also triggered transmission of adaptive behavior to the next generation  with female offspring showing greater effects than males[]. Molecular analyses showed that transcription differences acquired by the parents in response to environmental challenges are partially passed on to the F1 generation  and that the  gene[]  immune genes[]  and stress-related genes[] seem to be involved in these transmitted effects. This work also provides new insight into the role of DNA methylation in multigenerational epigenetic effects  by showing heritable differences of DNA methylation between different chicken breeds[]. The influence of the genetic background is a particularly interesting feature and it has been reported that the impact of the parental environment on the offspring’s phenotype depends on the chicken line[]. Observations in quail have also demonstrated a genetic component of maternal influence. Cross-fostering of chicks by mothers from two quail lines  divergently selected for tonic immobility (a fear-related behavioral trait)  showed that the level of maternal influence on the offspring’s behavioral development depends on the chick’s genetic origin[]. This maternal influence is at least partially carried by egg composition  as shown in a study of F1 quails from stressed females[] and using an - embryo transfer strategy between chicken layers and broilers[]. Collectively  the above-described examples yield two noteworthy conclusions. First  some of the early environmental effects on the offspring’s phenotype are sex-specific in both birds and mammals. Second  the environment experienced during early development seems to have a greater impact on the adult phenotype than that experienced later in life (Figure ). -[][][] (1) A first wave of DNA demethylation takes place in the male (blue curve) or female (red curve) primordial germ cells (PGC) of the F1 individuals; this occurs throughout the genome  including the imprinted genes (embryonic day (E10.5-13.5). (2) Then  the genome of the gametes undergoes  methylation  with maternal methylation marks established at a later stage (ovulation) than paternal marks (E14). (3) A second wave of DNA demethylation takes place after fertilization in the F2 zygote (E0.5)  with a more rapid demethylation in the paternal than the maternal genome. However  the paternal and maternal imprinted genes maintain their methylation pattern throughout this preimplantation reprogramming (dotted curves)  allowing the inheritance of parent-specific monoallelic expression in somatic tissues of the F2 individual. (4) Finally  genome-wide remethylation occurs in both parental genomes at about the time of implantation (E3.5). Altogether the very early embryonic development corresponds to an epigenomic reprogramming step  during which the new epigenetic marks are more prone to being impacted by the environment. This explains why the environment experienced during early development has a greater impact on the adult phenotype than that experienced later in life[]. Moreover  the timing of the two global DNA demethylation and remethylation waves differs between male and female genomes  possibly explaining why they may be differently impacted by a stress applied during these stages[  ]. Taken together  these examples show that the environment influences gene expression in avian species  perhaps via epigenetic mechanisms. An interesting feature in the context of poultry production and selection is the possibility that these influences may be retained across several successive generations. An example of transgenerational epigenetic transmission comes from the plant world. Johannes et al. showed that alterations in DNA methylation can be inherited for several generations in []. Using epiRIL (epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines)  these authors and others[] examined the transmission of epigenetic marks for at least eight generations  and observed that some were conserved while others gradually returned to their original methylation state. Similarly  interesting cases have been highlighted in animals. Erasure of methylation patterns during meiosis results in the establishment of new parent-specific imprints in oocytes and spermatocytes ([  ]  see Figure ). However  some loci can escape DNA methylation reprogramming  as for example  repeated elements such as retrotransposons[  ]. Moreover  miRNA were shown to be involved in the transmission of epigenetic information via the gametes[  ]. Thus  epigenetic information can be transmitted and have an impact on the next generations. Parental environment has an effect on the F1 generation and this is particularly clear in mammals  since the mother hosts the offspring’s development from the zygote stage to birth. Such effects will also occur in the F2 generation  since the developing F1 generation bears the primordial germ cells that will differentiate into gamete precursor cells and eventually form an F2 animal. In this way  the maternal environment can affect the next two generations (Figure )  which means that the first generation for which an individual’s cells are not directly exposed to an environmental effect is the F3 generation if it was the female that was exposed and the F2 generation if it was the male. Thus  evidence for transgenerational epigenetic transmission  i.e. incomplete erasure of epigenetic marks between generations resulting in unusual patterns of inheritance from one generation to the next  is unquestionable only if the effect is detected in the F3 generation or beyond[]. Investigating the male-path is an interesting approach to examine transgenerational epigenetic impacts.  In birds  the maternal environment has an impact on individuals of the F1 generation through the egg content. However  it can also impact individuals of the F2 generation  since the developing offspring bears the primordial germ cells (PGC) that later differentiate into gamete precursor cells and finally lead to the individuals of the F2 generation. Paternal environmental influences on the phenotype of the F1 generation (or even the F2 generation) have been shown in mammals (reviewed in[]). For example  the female offspring of adult male rats fed a high-fat diet showed modified ß-cell functions that were associated with an altered expression of more than 600 genes in the F1 generation  and hypomethylation of a cytosine proximal to the transcription start site of the  gene[]. Similarly  offspring from male rats fed a low-protein diet showed impaired lipid metabolism  notably associated with increased methylation at a putative enhancer of the  a gene[]. These results strongly suggest transmission of epigenetic information  but since the methylation patterns were not examined in the following generation  it is difficult to conclude to an unquestionable transgenerational epigenetic phenomenon  as defined above. Transgenerational epigenetic transmission may be rare  but it has already been reported in different mammalian species. In man  Pembrey reported that the paternal grandfather’s food supply affected the mortality rate of grandsons but not of granddaughters  whereas the paternal grandmother’s food supply affected the mortality rate of granddaughters but not of grandsons[  ]. Another study by Heijmans and collaborators showed that the risk of mortality in grandchildren  with respect to the grandparents’ food supply  was associated with modifications of DNA methylation in the differentially methylated region of the  gene[]. Recently  Zeybel et al.[] described an adaptive mechanism involving epigenetic mechanisms in rats. After inducing liver injury in F0 and/or F1 males  they showed a reduction of liver fibrogenesis in F2 male offspring  illustrating an unquestionable transgenerational inheritance. The authors observed epigenetic modifications in a number of genes  with alterations observed in CpG methylation ( <U+03B3>   a and -ß)  histone H3 acetylation ( <U+03B3> and -ß) and other chromatin modifications ( <U+03B3>). However  the mechanisms that transmit epigenetic modifications from the environment to the sperm and from the sperm to the offspring’s liver have not yet been deciphered[]. In rats  an epigenetic inheritance induced by different environmental components was observed in the sperm of the F3 generation by detecting differentially methylated regions depending on the environmental exposure of the ancestors[]. Some studies have even revealed transmission of epigenetic marks to at least the F4 generation. Recently  Wolstenholme et al. reported that exposure to bisphenol A during the gestation of female mice reduced the expression of the genes encoding two neuropeptides (oxytocin and vasopressin) in the brain of the F1 individuals. The expression of oxytocin was still reduced in the brain of the F4 males and females  whereas decreased vasopressin expression was maintained only in the F4 males. Moreover  impacts on social behavior were detected until the F4 generation[]. Another report on the analysis of the phenotype and epigenetic marks of female rats subjected to a high-energy diet for four generations  demonstrated that transgenerational effects involving altered epigenetic marks at each generation were induced (at least partly) []. Finally  the best-studied example of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in vertebrates concerns the influence of vinclozolin on the health (fertility problems or organic diseases) of rat male offspring in the F1 to F4 generations. This occurs via DNA methylation and a putative induction of copy number variation to generate new imprinted-like sites that are transmitted to subsequent generations through the male germ line  thus creating transgenerational transmission of adult phenotypes[–]. Other studies have suggested putative intergenerational transmission of epigenetic marks through the gametes[  ]. To our knowledge  no transgenerational transmission of epigenetic marks has been reported in birds  either prior to the exhaustive reviews by Jablonka and Raz[] and Ho and Burggren[]  or since then. A phenotype results from the interplay between the genome and the epigenome  which itself depends on the environment the animal experiences during its development and adult life. Epigenetic variations during early life play a role in producing inter-individual differences in phenotypes. Consequently  analyses of inter-individual phenotypic diversity should consider both epigenetic and genetic variations[]. In this review  we describe epigenetic phenomena in birds in comparison to the related studies in mammals. Much more work is needed to fully comprehend the importance of epigenetics in the phenotypic variability of birds  and hence to exploit it for genetic selection. In the chicken  epigenetic modifications occur from the first egg stage  i.e. a stage at which the dam provides an environmental signature through the egg content[]. These environmental influences may have agronomic value via their effect on the adult phenotype. Given the likelihood that climate will change in the more or less near future and demands for food supplies will increase  a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms governing the embryo’s response to environmental changes could open new ways to improve efficiency  animal welfare and food quality. For example  one interesting issue is the nutrient profile and restriction level of the diet of breeders  which is tailored to produce the largest possible number of fertile eggs and may thus not fill the requirements for future adult broiler performance[]. Transgenerational inheritance associated with mechanisms other than DNA sequence variation (i.e.  epigenetics  parental effects or \"cultural inheritance\") is thought to affect evolutionary dynamics[]. This \"non-classical\" inheritance is known to play a role in phenotypic variability  especially in the response to environmental changes[]. An important question in animal selection is the extent to which this non-genetic inheritance also affects the efficiency of genetic selection. Indeed  epigenetics may help to better explain environmental and non-Mendelian variability of complex traits[]. Several authors have proposed quantitative models including epigenetic inheritance and environmental interactions[–]  potentially paving the way for future inclusion of these mechanisms in genetic selection studies. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications (i.e.  their potentially transient nature) could constitute a challenge in the modeling of inheritance[]. Aside from putative epigenetic inheritance  Feinberg and coworkers proposed a model in which DNA mutations could  via epigenetic mechanisms  modify phenotypic variability without changing the mean phenotype[]. This model should be considered by geneticists aiming at studying the adaptation of livestock to changing environments. From a genetic point of view  the contribution of heritable epigenetic effects to important phenotypic variations is an exciting research area  not only for fundamental science  but also because of its possible breeding applications  as recently suggested by a primary poultry genetics organization[].

The correlation between estimates of genetic merit obtained by using imputed versus actual genotypes was around 0.96 for the 7K chip. Results of the present work suggested that the partial least squares regression imputation method could be useful to impute SNP genotypes when pedigree information is not available. In genomic selection programs  the breeding value (GEBV) of an individual is assessed by combining both genomic and traditional pedigree-based predictions. High-density marker platforms (HDP) of different SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) densities (50K and 777K) are currently used to genotype bulls under selection [] and elite cows and to test for marker-phenotype associations [  ]. Genotyping costs are among the major constraints for large-scale implementation of genomic selection in many breeds. However  the commercial availability of low density SNP panels (LDP)  such as the Illumina Bovine3K Genotyping BeadChip or the Illumina BovineLD BeadChip  which contains around 7K markers []  has offered new opportunities to increase the number of animals involved in selection programs. Genotypes obtained from an LDP must be imputed to the 50K platform by using suitable algorithms. Genotype imputation can also be useful when combining data sets that were generated using different SNP chips []. Genotype imputation refers to  reconstruction of missing genotypes. Several techniques have been proposed to routinely impute SNP genotypes. The following three steps are common to all procedures: (1) a training population (TP) genotyped with an HDP is created; (2) a prediction population (PP) is generated by using an LDP; and (3) a suitable algorithm is used to impute missing SNPs in the PP. On the basis of the information considered to infer missing marker genotypes  imputation methods can be classified into three groups. The first relies on linkage and family information [  ]  the second uses linkage disequilibrium based on population information [  ]  and the third combines the two former sources of information [  ]. Several factors affect imputation accuracy. In particular  imputation accuracy strongly depends on the number of individuals in the training population and on the marker density of the LDP [  –]. The impact of imputed genotypes on GEBV accuracies has been investigated. Results are sometimes discordant or expressed in different ways. For example  Chen et al. [] compared GEBV values obtained with actual and imputed data. Two computer programs  Findhap [] and Beagle []  were used to impute SNP genotypes from a 3K panel to a 50K panel. The loss of reliability in GEBV prediction by using imputed data was around 6.5% and 2.6% with Findhap and Beagle  respectively. Recently  Segelke et al. [] reported a reduction in reliability of genomic predictions  averaged over 12 traits  ranging from 5.3% to 1% for the 3K and 7K chips  respectively. Moser et al. [] proposed the use of an LDP that included the highest ranked SNPs for a trait under study. However  the gain in accuracy of GEBV obtained with the highest ranked SNP was only slightly higher (5–6%) than the accuracy obtained with an equal number of evenly spaced markers. Nevertheless  with this strategy  considering that a specific pool of markers is required for each trait  the use of evenly spaced SNP seems to be preferable over choosing a specific SNP set for each trait. Several imputation algorithms have been proposed and implemented in freely available software such as Beagle []  DAGPHASE [] and Findhap []. Chen et al. [] found Beagle to be the most accurate but at the expense of longer computation time. A method that uses the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) technique to impute SNP genotypes was proposed recently []. It was tested on a simulated genome consisting of 6000 SNPs equally distributed on six chromosomes and a data set of 5865 individuals (TP = 4665 and PP = 1200). The PLSR method yielded accuracies in marker imputation ranging from 0.99 to 0.86 when 10% or 90% genotypes were imputed  respectively. In the latter case  the accuracy of direct genomic values (DGV) dropped from 0.77 to 0.74. Furthermore  Dimauro et al. [] highlighted that  with a fixed percentage (50%) of SNPs to be predicted  imputation accuracies slowly decreased from 98% with TP = 5000  to 87% with TP = 1000 and to 69% with TP = 600. PLSR requires only genotype data  and other data  such as pedigree relationships  is not needed. Therefore  this approach could be useful when the population structure is not known. The aim of the present work was to test the PLSR imputation method on real data. In particular  a scenario with a 50K genotyped TP and a PP genotyped using either the 3K or 7K panel was simulated. Moreover  the ability of the PLSR method to predict SNP genotypes for different bovine breeds and in a multi-breed approach was tested. Data consisted of SNP genotypes belonging to 2179 Italian Holstein bulls genotyped with the Illumina 50K Beadchip (single-breed dataset). Only markers located on the 29 autosomes were considered. Monomorphic SNPs and SNPs with more than 2.5% missing values were discarded. No editing for minor allele frequency (MAF) was applied. A total of 43 427 SNPs were retained and any missing genotypes for these SNPs were replaced by the most frequent genotype at that locus. Data on a total of 86 bulls were discarded  of which 48 were replicates or had inconsistent Mendelian inheritance information  and 38 had a low overall call rate (lower than 95%). To study the performance in a multi-breed sample  749 Brown Swiss and 470 Simmental bulls were also available. For the multi-breed data set  data from the three breeds were edited together to obtain the same SNPs in all data sets. At the end of the editing procedure  30 055 markers were retained. Genotypes were coded according to the number of copies of a given SNP allele they carried  i.e. 0 (homozygous for allele B)  1 (heterozygous) or 2 (homozygous for allele A). The phenotypes available for all animals were polygenic estimated breeding values for milk yield  protein and fat content. Animals were ranked according to their age: the oldest were designed as TP with all genotypes considered known  whereas the youngest represented the PP. For both the single and multi-breed approach  SNPs belonging to 3K and 7K LDP were identified in the PP animals and all other genotypes were masked  thus mimicking the two Illumina LDP. PLSR is a multivariate statistical covariance-based technique that is able to predict a response matrix  from a predictor matrix  and to describe the common structure of the two matrices []. In both  and    represents the number of animals involved   is the number of SNPs in the LDP and  is the number of SNPs to be imputed. PLSR allows for the identification of underlying variables (known as latent factors) which are linear combinations of the explanatory variables   that best model . Dimauro et al. [] demonstrated that the accuracy of PLSR prediction increases with the number of latent factors approaching the number of SNPs to be predicted (the columns of ). The maximum number of latent factors depends on the size of   which has a lower number of columns than . For this reason  in each run  the number of extracted latent factors was fixed to be equal to the number of predictors (the number of columns of ). PLSR is a multivariate statistical technique particularly useful in genomic studies in which a great number of variables are involved. It can overcome the strong collinearity between SNP variables in  or  and  at the same time  maximize correlations between  and  variables [  ]. A more detailed description of the PLSR imputation method can be found in Dimauro et al. []. In the present work  each chromosome was processed independently and data were analyzed by using the PLS procedure of SAS® software (SAS® institute Inc.  Cary  NC). Datasets were organized in a multivariate manner  having SNPs as columns and animals as rows. The 50K SNPs were divided into SNPs that have to be imputed () and SNPs used as predictors (). In particular   contained only SNPs belonging to the 3K or 7K LDP. For animals in the PP  genotypes in  were masked and constituted the SNPs to be predicted. The comparison of imputation performances from different publications is difficult due to the many differences between studies. TP size and number of markers in LDP heavily affect the accuracy of prediction. Moreover  the relationships between training and validation animals have an impact on imputation accuracies []. So  before applying the PLSR imputation method to our data  the method was tested on external data provided by Daetwyler et al. [] who exploited the ChromoPhase program [] to impute missing genotypes from low to high density SNP platforms. The data consisted of 1183 Holstein bulls genotyped with the Illumina 50K chip. Only the 2529 markers on chromosome 1 were available. A PP genotyped with the 3K chip (182 SNP) was simulated by masking the markers not present on the 3K chip. In particular  the PP was divided into non-founders (112 individuals that have at least one genotyped parent) and founders (212 animals that do not have a genotyped parent) and imputation accuracies were evaluated for both categories of animals. The PLSR method and Beagle [] software were used to impute SNP genotypes in the PP and results were compared with accuracies obtained by Daetwyler et al. []. Population structure or pedigree was not used with either method. In our experimental data  PLSR was first applied to the Holstein breed. Animals were ranked by age and divided in TP = 1993 (the older bulls) and PP = 100 (the younger) and both 3K and 7K scenarios were investigated. The Beagle software was applied to the same data. No pedigree information was used for either PLSR or Beagle. On simulated data  Dimauro et al. [] demonstrated that  for each chromosome  the PLSR imputation accuracy improved as the number of variables contained in  increased. The reason is that when many variables have to be predicted (the columns of the  matrix)  the number of extracted latent factors should be large. The maximum number of possible latent factors is  however  less or equal to the number of variables in . So  for chromosomes with a relatively low number of markers in   a lower PLSR predictive ability is expected. This hypothesis can be easily tested by comparing the imputation accuracies obtained in the 3K and 7K scenarios. Moreover  a PLSR run using an  matrix obtained by combining SNPs belonging to chromosomes 26  27 and 28  was carried out to test for possible improvement in genotype imputation accuracy when  is artificially enlarged. The availability of a sufficiently large TP is a crucial factor for genotype imputation. Therefore  it is interesting to investigate if a multi-breed TP could enhance the accuracy of genotype predictions. Some authors [  ] reported a slight advantage of using a multi-breed TP to evaluate the genetic merit of animals under selection. However  Hayes et al. [] showed that  in sheep breeds  accuracy of imputation in single-breed analyses was higher than accuracy of imputation in a multi-breed analysis. To test the PLSR method in a multi-breed context  three groups of animals  one for each breed  were selected. Each group contained 479 bulls (the size of the Simmental population) and was split into a TP of 379 and a PP of 100 individuals. The imputation was first performed separately for each single breed and then by combining the three groups  thus obtaining a multi-breed dataset with TP = 1137 and PP = 300 bulls. The ability of PLSR to impute SNP genotypes was quantified by considering the allele imputation error rate. This index represents the number of falsely imputed alleles divided by the total number of imputed alleles []. In practice  considering the real and the imputed genotypes  0 error was counted if both genotypes were identical  1 if the real genotype was homozygous and the imputed genotype heterozygous (or vice versa) and 2 if the real and imputed genotypes were both homozygous but different. The imputation accuracy (R)  for each SNP  was equal to 1 minus allele error rate. The allele error rate and the related imputation accuracy were averaged both by chromosome and across all chromosomes. The effect of SNP imputation on accuracy of DGV was also evaluated. DGV for milk yield  fat content and protein content were calculated using both the actual 50K markers (DGV) and the imputed genotypes (DGV_IMP). Briefly  effects of SNP genotypes on phenotypes in the TP population were estimated using a BLUP model []: where  is the vector of polygenic breeding values   is a vector of ones   is the overall mean   is the matrix of SNP scores   is the vector of SNP regression coefficients assumed identically and normally distributed with (0   ) where  = /k ( = additive genetic variance  k = number SNP)  and  is the vector of random residuals. The overall mean () and the vector () of the marker effects estimated in the TP were used to calculate the DGV for PP as: where  is the vector of estimated DGV and  is the matrix of SNP scores in PP. For each phenotype  both DGV and DGV_IMP were obtained and correlations between DGV and DGV_IMP were calculated (r). Results obtained by analyzing Daetwyler’s data are reported in Table . Values of R for both PLSR and Beagle were higher than those obtained with ChromoPhase  especially for founder bulls. Nearly equal values were obtained by PLSR and Beagle for non-founder animals whereas for founders  imputation accuracy using PLSR was more than 5% higher than with Beagle. Table  contains accuracies obtained with PLSR and Beagle for imputation from 3K and 7K SNP chips to 50K based on the 2093 Holstein bulls. The average R using PLSR was 89.6% (± 1.6%) and 94.2% (± 1.0%) for imputation from 3K and 7K chips  respectively. Accuracies obtained with PLSR were 4% higher than with Beagle for both LDP. As expected  R for each chromosome was higher for imputation from 7K than for imputation from 3K. For both LDP  imputation accuracies were higher for chromosomes with a high number of SNPs. For example  R was more than 4% higher for BTA1 than for BTA28  for imputation from 3K (Table ). Finally  R obtained by combining SNPs on BTA27  28 and 29 was 87.4%  which was nearly equal to the average R of the three chromosomes (87 3%)  indicating that no advantage was obtained by combining markers from multiple chromosomes. Imputation accuracies obtained by including the Brown Swiss and Simmental breeds  both for imputation within breed and in the multiple breed scenario  are reported in Table . For the 3K LDP  R was 0.88 and 0.89 for Holstein and Brown Swiss breeds  respectively  whereas R was equal to 0.83 for Simmental. Imputation accuracies from 7K to 50K were  on average  4% higher than imputation accuracies from 3K to 50K. However  the multi-breed approach led to a considerable decrease in accuracy and to a reduction of differences in imputation accuracies between breeds  for imputation from both 3K and 7K. Accuracies of DGV predictions were moderate (Table )  in accordance with the low number of animals in TP. However  correlations between polygenic EBV and DGV (r) and correlations between EBV and DGV_IMP (r) were quite similar with actual and imputed data. This result is in agreement with the relatively high correlations between DGV and DGV_IMP (r)  which were on average 0.96 across the three considered traits with the 7K LDP. However  r was lower when using the 3K LDP  for which r was on average 0.89. Results of PLSR applied to Daetwyler’s data (Table ) showed that the method did not produce different imputation accuracies for founders and non-founders  unlike ChromoPhase and  partly  Beagle. In our analyses  we never used pedigree information. As a consequence  both founders and non-founders were handled in the same manner. However  having a parent in the reference dataset seemed to be more important when using Beagle than when using PLSR. This is probably due to the different algorithms implemented in Beagle [] and PLSR [  ]. PLSR imputation accuracies  from 3K and 7K LDP to the 50K panel  were higher than accuracies obtained with Beagle and ChromoPhase. These results indicate that  if no pedigree information is available  the PLSR method should be preferred over the other methods studied here when imputation is from 3K or 7K to 50K. PLSR was further used to impute SNP genotypes both in single and multi-breed scenarios based on Holstein  Simmental and Brown Swiss data sets. No MAF threshold was applied in the editing procedure. To investigate whether differences in imputation accuracies between PLSR and the Beagle algorithms could arise with edits based on MAF  the impact of several MAF thresholds (no limit  0.01  0.05  0.10) was evaluated. However  no differences in imputation accuracies were observed between the PLSR and Beagle results. Mean R values obtained with PLSR in the single-breed scenario were 89 6% and 94 2% for the 3K and 7K LDP  respectively. It is worth mentioning that  in the present study  the ratio between the number of animals ( = 2179 Holstein bulls) involved in the study and the mean number of markers ( 1497) on each chromosome    was 1.45. Dimauro et al. []  tested the PLSR imputation method on a simulated data set with  = 1000 markers on a chromosome and  = 5865 individuals. The resulting  was 5.9. In ordinary statistics and  even more  in multivariate statistics  the availability of a larger number of observations guarantees more accurate results. Thus  Dimauro et al. [] applied the PLSR method in a more optimal dataset  obtaining an imputation accuracy of 0.86. Even if the latter study and the present research are difficult to compare  the large difference between  ratios suggests that PLSR also works properly with actual data. This is an important result because  if a particular technique gives good results when applied to simulated data  it is not obvious that similar performances are obtained with actual data. PLSR is an ordinary statistical technique included in the most popular commercial and free software packages that are currently used to perform genomic data analyses  such as SAS and R. The PLSR approach could thus be easily implemented in software for genomic evaluations previously developed. Moreover  with PLSR  the computing time needed to impute SNP genotypes was  on average  around 10 times lower than with Beagle. For example  with the 7K LDP  PLSR took around 1 h to impute SNP genotypes for the first chromosome  whereas Beagle needed around 8 h. This aspect should not be underrated when an algorithm is chosen to perform imputation. In particular  PLSR could probably be used to impute SNP genotypes from the 50K chip to the denser Illumina 777K platform in a reasonable amount of time. Imputation from 7K to 50K (R = 0.94) was more accurate than imputation from 3K to 50K (R = 0.90). This is an expected result and it is comparable to that obtained by Mulder et al. []  who found a mean imputation accuracy of around 88% for 3K and 92% for 7K  respectively. The mean R for each chromosome (Table ) showed that genotype imputation accuracy depends strongly on the number of SNP variables in the  matrix. For example  in the 3K panel  BTA1 and BTA25 have 146 and 41 SNPs  respectively  and the related values of R were 0.92 and 0.87. Dimauro et al. [] found that imputation accuracy increases as the number of extracted latent factors in the PLSR procedure increases. The maximum number of possible latent factors is lower than or equal to the number of variables in . This can explain the lower imputation accuracy for chromosomes with a lower number of markers. Moreover  the dimension of  cannot be artificially enlarged by using SNP from several chromosomes because it resulted in an accuracy that was equal to the mean of accuracies obtained with each chromosome. This result suggests that a chromosome can be considered as a genetically and statistically independent unit. Results for imputation based on information from multiple breeds obtained in this study  basically confirm previous reports. Values of R using multi-breed information (Table ) were considerably lower than R for imputation within breeds. Similarly  Hayes et al. [] obtained no advantage or  sometimes  worse results  for imputation based on information from multiple breeds  compared to single-breed information. Also  R for Simmental was lower than R for the other breeds. Dassonneville et al. [] also reported lower imputation accuracies in the French Blonde d’Aquitaine beef breed (around 5%) than in two dairy breeds. The lower imputation accuracy for Simmental may be partially explained by the fact that the Illumina 50K platform was not tested on the Simmental breed [] and that the effective population size of the three breeds is very different  being higher for the Simmental than the other breeds [–]. Differences in the underlying structure [] of the three populations may impact imputation accuracies. Finally  the use of a multi-breed TP also did not give better accuracies in GEBV prediction than the single-breed scenario [  ]. The impact of the SNP genotype imputation on the accuracy of DGV was small. Correlations between DGV and DGV_IMP were  on average  0.96 for all traits for imputation from 7K to 50K  and 0.89 for imputation from 3K to 50K. Similar results were obtained by Berry and Kearney []  who reported an average correlation of 0.97 across 15 traits for the 3K LDP. The lowest correlations between DGV and DGV_IMP were observed for imputation from 3K to 50K for protein content (0.86) and milk yield (0.89). The correlation between DGV and DGV_IMP was approximately the same (around 0.96) for all traits  when imputation was from 7K to 50K. Weigel et al. [] reported similar values  both for milk yield and protein content  and confirmed that DGV_IMP predictions improve if the number of SNPs on the LDP increases  both for protein content and milk yield. Therefore  the 7K chip seems to be an efficient imputation tool and the imputed genotypes could be used to correctly estimate DGV for milk yield  and fat and protein content. This study demonstrates that the PLSR imputation method can efficiently impute missing genotypes from LDP to HDP. With this method  the same good results are obtained whether animals in the PP have parents in the TP or not. Moreover  the computing time was markedly lower than with Beagle. The PLSR method was applied chromosome-wise and the results indicate that imputation accuracies are higher when the number of SNPs in the  matrix is high. However  combining markers from several chromosomes did not increase the accuracy of imputation  which confirms that chromosomes are independent genetic and statistical units. The 7K LDP gave good results both in terms of R and DGV prediction. Similar to the 3K LDP  the multi-breed approach applied to the 7K scenario  did not yield better results than the single-breed approach.

With support from experimental data  we conclude that selection for low faecal worm egg count should be stable over a short time frame (e.g. 20 years). We are further exploring model outcomes with multiple loci and comparing outcomes to other control strategies. Sheep selected over many generations for low faecal worm egg count (WEC) show large reductions in WEC when infected with gastro-intestinal parasites [–]. This reduction in WEC indicates a reduced reproductive capacity  or reduced fitness  for worms in these hosts. A concern often voiced is that worm adaptation to sheep bred for low WEC may occur. The expectation is that natural selection results in worms increasing their fitness (or reproductive capacity) over time and this could erode the benefits of selecting sheep for low WEC. However  to date these expectations have not been realised in experiments [–] and  anecdotally  breed differences in WEC appear to be stable across time. In this paper  we investigate whether the expectation of worm adaptation to low WEC sheep is realistic and attempt to determine factors that influence this potential rate of evolution. A compelling explanation of why worms are not observed to adapt to sheep selected for low WEC is lacking. Numerous authors have put forward possible explanations  including features of the host-parasite relationship that slow the rate of adaptation  such as the skewed distribution of WEC  which results in the majority of worms being harboured by susceptible hosts; and the insensitivity of WEC as a measure of adaptation e.g. [–]. However these assertions are rarely (if ever) quantified. It is unclear which factors influence adaptation of worms to hosts that have been selected for improved resistance. More generally  it is important to know which factors might also be applicable to other livestock disease systems (i.e. species and pathogens) such as selection of salmon or chickens for improved resistance to bacterial or viral infections. This investigation aims at identifying the key theoretical parameters that determine adaptation of nematodes in sheep. Results of this study may also give insight into the possible influence of these parameters in other situations. To explore factors that may affect the rate of parasite adaptation to host genotype  we describe a model that combines interacting descriptions of host genetics  parasite genetics and disease biology. We explore its key parameters and test hypotheses relating to observable rates of parasite adaptation. The model is parameterised using a single locus  gene-for-gene model. We investigate the factors that generate or maintain genetic variation in worms at this interacting locus and test two specific hypotheses relating to worm adaptation i.e. (1) the relative rate of adaptation in worms is slowed by features of the host-parasite relationship  such as the skewed distribution of WEC and the different mechanisms by which sheep reduce WEC  and (2) WEC is an insensitive measure of worm adaptation. This paper describes results from two models  referred to as the ‘full’ and ‘reduced’ models. Both models have the same underlying interaction between genotype of the sheep and the worm but the full model also includes non-genetic factors related to the infection of sheep with gastrointestinal worms. Details of the genotype interaction and the worm infection used in the full model are given in the section entitled “Model construction”. Key definitions are that the  allele results in ‘resistance’ or low WEC in sheep  compared to the alternate  allele  and the  allele in worms is favourable for parasitizing sheep with the  allele (compared to the alternate  allele). In the section entitled “Model interrogation”  we describe five scenarios  which are used to explore the values of the parameters that maintain genetic variation in worms (Scenarios 1 and 2)  describe the properties of the worm infection and genotype by genotype interaction (Scenarios 3 and 4) and test the hypotheses (Scenario 5). For simplicity  all simulations aim at maintaining a constant frequency of the  allele in sheep flocks over time and therefore we detect ‘adaptation’ of worms to particular flocks by observing an increase in the frequency of the  allele in worms. To assess the impact of selecting sheep for lower WEC (i.e. an increase in the frequency of the  allele)  we simulate a range of sheep flocks with different frequencies for  and deduce the impact on the worm population of selecting sheep for lower WEC by interpolation between the different flocks. The model aims at describing worm adaptation to sheep with low WEC and hence it quantifies only differences between sheep genotypes for which worms possess the genetic potential to adapt. The interaction assumes bi-allelic loci with additive allelic effects (Table ). The frequency of the  allele in sheep is  and the frequency of the  allele in worms is . Genotype frequencies are given by Hardy-Weinberg proportions []  such that sheep with  genotype have a population frequency of . The  allele in worms is favourable for parasitizing sheep that carry the  allele (i.e. those animals with improved resistance to worms). The magnitude of this survival advantage in worms is determined by the parameter  (survival in the host). The model also has capacity for pleiotropic effects for the  allele so that the allele may be unfavourable for survival in free-living stages of the worm lifecycle (Table ) []. The degree of pleiotropy is controlled by the free-living survival parameter  (survival on pasture)  such that the pleiotropic effects do not act when  is zero. Therefore  there is the potential for  to increase when the worms are harboured by sheep with the  allele and for  to decrease during the free-living stage. There is a subtle but important distinction between ‘worm fitness’  defined as the success of an individual throughout its lifecycle  and ‘worm survival’  which is relevant to only one aspect of the lifecycle. The reduced model uses only population-level genetic information to predict the expected change in the frequency of the  allele in worms (per generation) for a given frequency of the  allele in sheep. The generational fitness (O) is the average fitness of the worm    and  genotypes  weighted by the expected frequency of the three host genotypes from Table . That is: The change in worm allele frequency []  is then: where  and  are the frequency of the  allele in the current and next worm generations. In contrast to the full model  the reduced model assumes an infinite population of worms and uses discrete generations to make deterministic predictions of the change in . The full model includes a flock of sheep grazing on a common pasture. Each sheep has its own level of resistance and worm population  with worms continuously infecting and re-infecting sheep. The worm lifecycle obeys the time-dependent dynamics seen with worm infections and  over a season  animals slowly develop increased immunity to the worm infections. The flock has a skewed distribution of WEC measurements  in accordance with field observations. The full model is described in full detail in Additional file . Briefly  the sheep by worm genotype interaction is expanded into a series of daily steps. Each day  sheep ingest worm larvae and initiate a set of interactions unique to the infected animal’s genotype and the genotype of the larvae ingested on that day. Over time  a proportion of the ingested larvae develop into adult worms. Adult (female) worms produce eggs until they eventually die. The eggs produced by worms on a given day can be observed in each animal via a measurement of WEC. Eggs are deposited on the pasture in the faeces and develop over several days. Initially  newly hatched larvae from these eggs are immature but after 7 days the mature larvae are available for ingestion by the grazing flock. Thus  the model has subpopulations of worms defined by day age-classes  either on pasture or within a host  and a flock of grazing sheep. Each day age-class of worms has its own frequency of the  allele (). We explore three postulated mechanisms for the sheep genotype to influence WEC in sheep: (i) reduce worm establishment  (ii) increase adult worm mortality and (iii) reduce adult egg production [    ]. The  allele acts through these mechanisms in sheep  facilitating the potential for worms to adapt in the full model. For each mechanism  the  allele reduces WEC by a defined amount  (described below)  such that homozygous  sheep have a WEC that is  lower than the WEC of homozygous  sheep. In the simulations  each mechanism to reduce WEC is tested independently. Worm alleles at the interacting locus could either be  mutations or variants that already segregate in the population. The reduced model was used to examine these two situations and the properties of the genotype by genotype interaction. There are two scenarios  as defined in Table   which use a range of parameter values for  (the initial frequency of the  allele in worms)   (the survival advantage of worms with the  allele in sheep with the  allele)   (the survival penalty on pasture for the  allele) and  (the frequency of the  allele in sheep). Scenario 1 investigates the impact of changes in  on the outcome for  over many generations  while other parameters are held constant. This scenario is relevant to study the properties of  mutations that are initially very rare in the population. Scenario 2 explores the maintenance of segregating variants and the impact of changing the survival advantage () and trade-off () of the  allele in worms. The frequency of the  allele in sheep was equal to 0.2  0.5 or 0.8. Interpolation across simulations in Scenario 2 shows the properties of the segregating  allele for worms in flocks of sheep with an increasing frequency of the  allele. The properties of the worm infection for the full model were examined in two scenarios under conditions whereby the sheep by worm genotype interaction could not influence the results. These scenarios aimed at demonstrating the properties and appropriateness of the simulated worm infection. Parameters for these scenarios are defined in Table  (Scenarios 3 and 4). The aim of Scenario 3 was to evaluate the characteristics of the worm infection in a single season. This scenario used a ‘susceptible’ sheep flock (i.e.  = 0) and  was zero  therefore there was no potential for the worm population to adapt. Scenario 4 tested the properties of the  allele in sheep to ensure that each mechanism to reduce WEC had an equivalent effect. That is  we wanted to calibrate the mechanisms such that homozygous  sheep had a WEC that was  lower than homozygous  (‘susceptible’) sheep. Special conditions were required for this scenario to prevent accumulation of effects throughout a season  in order to ensure equivalent test conditions between the mechanisms at the end of the season  and also because the effect  of the  allele depends on the frequency of the  allele in worms. Effects can accumulate within a season because the genotype profile of the worm population changes continually  affecting subsequent WEC measurements. Thus  the allele frequency of the worm population was fixed to 0.5 during each transition stage (i.e. when ingested as L larvae in sheep and when first deposited as eggs on pasture). A frequency of 0.5 was chosen to ensure equal numbers of homozygotes for worm genotypes. The average allele effect  was calculated as where  is the average WEC of sheep that are homozygous for the low WEC allele  and  is that of homozygous susceptible sheep. Hypothesis 1 proposes that features of the host-parasite interaction will slow the rate of adaptation. These factors are either (a) factors involved in worm infection (e.g. a skewed distribution of WEC or overlapping worm generations) or (b) the mechanisms of resistance. This hypothesis was tested by assessing if the reduced model could predict the change in  from the full model  using each of the three postulated mechanisms to reduce WEC. Thus  we tested all factors included in the full model that are not involved in the genotype by genotype interaction. Parameters to test the hypothesis are detailed in Scenario 5 (Table ). The parameters were defined such that worms with the  allele can have a 25% survival in sheep that carry the  allele but there is a 10% survival trade-off for the  allele on pasture (i.e.  = 0.25   = 0.1). Sheep with one copy of the  allele had approximately a 25% reduction in WEC. Each proposed mechanism by which sheep reduce WEC was tested in turn  for scenarios in which the frequency of the  allele was increased incrementally from 0 (susceptible) to 1 (resistant). The initial frequency of the  allele in worms () was 0.3. Results presented for these scenarios were the mean of five replicate sheep flocks. Worm adaptation to sheep with the low WEC  allele may be expected to result in an increase in WEC over time for these animals  i.e. when worms adapt to sheep with the  allele  they increase their egg output and hence WEC. In our model  we expect an increase in  (i.e. ‘adaptation’) to be associated with an increase in WEC. We used WEC as an indicator of adaptation for data generated from Scenario 5. A linear model () was fitted to the replicate mean WEC over time. Adaptation to the  allele in sheep was declared if the regression coefficient () was significantly greater than zero (P < 0.001). The reduced model was used to investigate the effect of changes to the underlying parameters for the genotype interaction; . changes to      and  (i.e. the initial frequency of the  allele in worms  the survival advantage and trade-off for the  allele and the frequency of the “resistance”  allele in sheep). The results from Scenario 1 are important when considering  mutations as a source of genetic variation for adaptation in worm populations. This is because  mutations are expected to be very rare alleles (i.e. a very low ). The results indicate that changing  had little impact on the final outcome for the  allele but that  did affect the number of generations required before an observable change in  occurred (Figure ). Thus  worms adapt ( tends to 1) when the  allele increases worm survival in sheep with the  allele and when the  allele has no pleiotropic effects  regardless of the initial frequency of the  allele. Changing  affected the total number of generations required until fixation but had no affect on the rate of change at a given allele frequency. For example  an allele that was initially very rare ( = 0.001) took 80 generations to achieve fixation compared to an allele that was initially at a higher frequency (i.e.  = 0.1). Thus   mutations are expected to behave like other alleles with similar properties (i.e.  and ) but observable changes for these alleles will be slower compared to similar alleles at higher frequencies.      Under Scenario 1  there is a 20% survival advantage () for the  allele in sheep carrying the  allele and no mortality trade-off on pasture ( = 0). Scenario 2 investigated changing the magnitude of the survival effects ( and ) of the  allele. Changes in these parameters had dramatic impacts on the final outcome for the  allele. Figure  summarises results from many simulations using the reduced model  when the  allele in sheep had a frequency of 0.2  0.5 or 0.8. The results indicate that for most of the tested parameter combinations  worms adapt either by fixing ( = 1) or completely losing ( = 0) the  allele. If the survival trade-off of the  allele on pasture is greater than its survival advantage in sheep  then the  allele will be lost. Since  = 1  worm survival on pasture is always more important than worm survival in the host and thus in most cases when   then  tends to 0. This is because the  allele is advantageous to worms only when they are harboured by sheep with the low WEC  allele (which is uncommon if the frequency of  is low)  while the survival trade-off for the  allele acts on all larvae while on pasture. Thus  the relative importance of survival on pasture depends on the frequency of the  allele in sheep. For example  a mutation in worms with a 30% survival advantage in sheep ( = 0.3) and a 15% survival trade-off on pasture ( = 0.15) would be lost when the frequency of the  allele in sheep was low ( = 0.2)  but would remain segregating if the frequency of the  allele was higher (i.e.  = 0.5).      Under Scenario 2  the  allele survival advantage in sheep carrying the  allele (  y-axis) and pasture mortality (  x-axis) range from 0 to 30%. If the mutations available for adaptation come from segregating variants at the interacting locus in worms  they must persist after many generations of natural selection. Results from Figure  show the type of variants that segregated in the worm population after 80 generations of natural selection. These results indicate a grey area of segregating variants where the  allele in worms is neither fixed nor lost. However  given (e.g.) 200 or 1000 generations  this grey area of segregating alleles would be even smaller. For polymorphism to be maintained indefinitely  the homozygous  and  worm genotypes are required to have equal fitness (i.e.  =  from equation () only when . Thus over many generations  only alleles where the survival advantage is precisely balanced by the survival trade-off remain segregating. Some unbalanced alleles may also appear to segregate (or drift) because as  tends to 1  the rate of change in the frequency of the  allele tends to 0. If adaptation in worms occurs by a change in frequency of segregating variants  then these alleles must affect worm survival but must also have a neutral or near neutral overall effect on worm fitness. Otherwise natural selection would act to fix the favourable allele in worms regardless of the worm resistance exhibited by the sheep. The values for the survival advantage and the trade-off for alleles which segregate indefinitely depend on the frequency of the low WEC  allele in sheep. As the frequency of the  allele increases  the relative importance of survival on pasture decreases (i.e. the polymorphic combinations in Figure  rotate clockwise from vertical   ˜ 0  to 45° from vertical   tends to   as the frequency of  increases). Interestingly  the number of parameter sets for which alleles remain segregating (i.e. the size of the grey area) does not depend on the frequency of the  allele. For example  the grey area is an equal size when only one ( = 1.0) or all three (e.g.  = 0.2) sheep genotypes are present  implying that heterogeneity in sheep does not increase worm heterogeneity in our model. The  allele at the interacting locus only remains segregating after many generations when there is no overall fitness effect for the allele; either the survival advantage of the  allele in sheep with the  allele is balanced by the survival trade-off on pasture  or the  allele does not affect worm survival. However  this balance depends on the frequency of the  allele. Thus  if we take a given sheep population and imagine selecting for an increase in frequency of the  allele (i.e. increased resistance to worms or a reduced WEC)  then worm alleles that previously had no fitness effect may become favourable and begin to increase in frequency. The rate of increase in the  allele is determined by the magnitude of change in the frequency of the  allele  i.e. the change in the frequency of the  allele determines how unbalanced the survival advantage and trade-off in worms becomes. If the frequency of the  allele is slightly increased  then there is only a small change in the selection pressures that act on the worms (i.e. a small rotation in the grey area) and  over time  the frequency of the  allele increases slowly. If there is a large increase in the frequency of the  allele  then the change in the selection pressures for the worm population is greater and this will cause a more rapid increase in the frequency of the  allele. In summary  if adaptation in worms is to be observed from segregating variants  the mutation needs to change from having a neutral to having a favourable effect on worm fitness. The magnitude of this change in fitness determines the rate of adaptation  i.e. the rate of increase in frequency of the favourable  allele. Scenario 3 aims at investigating the epidemiological properties of the full model without the complication of genetic variation in either the sheep or worm populations. The degree of pasture contamination shows the presence of a pasture reservoir of worm larvae (Figure ). There are two annual peaks in total pasture contamination  the first at around day 45 and the second at day 85; and two slightly earlier peaks in new infective L stage larvae on pasture. These peaks are caused by two successive generations of worms infecting the sheep. WEC and worm burden (not shown) show skewed distributions  which is characteristic of these traits. Mean adult burden was 19 310 and mean WEC 769 eggs per gram (epg). The degree of skewness in WEC agrees with previous experimental results []. The average generation length for the worm population was 45 days. Hence one year (or 100 days of simulation) is equivalent to 2.2 worm generations  in accordance with field observations [  ]. These results indicate that our model adequately captured the key epidemiological characteristics of worm infections that we aimed to include in our model.  Results are from a single replicate of a susceptible sheep flock under Scenario 3. The effect of the low WEC  allele in sheep and the corresponding change in the frequency of the  allele in worms is reported in Table   taking a census at day 100. For the purpose of testing the model  we held the frequency of the  allele for ingested larvae and new eggs on pasture at 0.5  preventing accumulation of changes to worm allele frequency within a season. This procedure was only used when testing the model to ensure correct parameterisation. Depending on the mechanism implemented  sheep with one copy of the  allele either reduce the proportion of larvae that establish by 0.029 (untransformed scale)  increase daily mortality by 0.038  or reduce female fecundity by 16 eggs per worm. The low WEC allele () reduced WEC at day 100 by approximately 25% (or 100–150 epg) for all mechanisms; hence the WEC of homozygous  sheep was 40 to 60% of the WEC of homozygous  sheep. Table  demonstrates some important consequences of the mechanisms to reduce WEC and of the epidemiological model. These include: A reduction in the number of adult worms as  increases (from  to  to  sheep)  when the  allele reduces worm establishment or increases adult mortality. The adult worms are younger when harboured by sheep with an  allele that acts by increasing adult worm mortality. As expected  there is no change in the number of adult worms in sheep with the  allele when it acts to reduce worm fecundity. There is an increase in the frequency of the  allele for adult worms harboured by sheep with the  allele when the mechanism of the  allele is to reduce worm establishment or increase adult worm mortality. Similar to point 1 above  no differences in the frequency of the  allele are evident between    and  sheep genotypes when the  allele acts by reducing worm fecundity. The frequency of the  allele is unchanged from adult worms to eggs when the  allele acts by either reducing worm establishment or increasing adult mortality. However  the frequency of the  allele is greater in the eggs than in adult worms when the  allele acts by reducing worm fecundity. The frequency of the  allele increases in sheep (i.e. in sheep with the  allele) but decreases during the pasture stage of the lifecycle. That is  there is a survival trade-off on pasture for the  allele. The magnitude of increase in the frequency of the  allele differs between the three mechanisms of the  allele. When the  allele acts by reducing adult worm fecundity  the change in allele frequency is approximately half of that when the  allele acts by reducing establishment or increasing adult worm mortality. This is insightful for the fecundity mechanism. When the  allele acts by reducing worm fecundity  it affects only the female worms that contribute to the next generation and not the male worms (i.e. the effect is sex-limited). Thus  the magnitude of increase for  in the eggs is only half of that when the mechanism of the  allele acts on both sexes. The change in frequency of the worm  allele is shown over 20 generations for Scenario 5 in Figure  (plots A  B  C). For most frequencies of the  allele in sheep  the  allele in worms either moves towards fixation or loss. The rate of change (i.e. the slope of the line) depends on the frequency of the  allele in sheep. Thus  as the sheep population has lower WEC (i.e. as  increases)  the slope describing the change in the frequency of the  allele in worms is increasingly positive  indicating that the  allele is favourable. Adaptation was most rapid when the low WEC  allele in sheep was fixed ( = 1.0).    Under scenario 5  there is a 25% survival advantage () and 10% pasture mortality () for the  worm allele. The mechanisms by which sheep reduce faecal worm egg count (WEC) are () reduced worm establishment  () increased worm mortality  or () reduced worm fecundity; the frequency of the low WEC  allele in sheep is investigated at 11 levels  from low (light blue) to high (dark blue) frequencies and also when the allele is absent (black). Comparing the change in allele frequency in worms between the outputs of the four models allows the first hypothesis to be tested (Figure ). If non-genetic factors involved with the worm lifecycle  such as the skewness of WEC and a reservoir of infective larvae on pasture  had an effect on the rate of worm adaptation  then there would be observable differences between outputs from the full and the reduced models. Second  if differences in the rate of adaptation are due to the mechanisms by which WEC is reduced in sheep  there would be differences between the three sets of results from the full model. Figure  shows a strong similarity between the allele frequency change for the establishment and mortality mechanisms from the full model and the reduced model  bearing in mind that one year approximates 2.2 parasite generations. There may be a slightly higher final frequency of the  allele for worms that parasitize sheep with the mortality mechanism  compared to results from the establishment mechanism or from the reduced model. This is probably due to the non-linearity of the mortality mechanism and the accumulation of effects over time due to changes in the age structure of the worm population. In contrast  the results from the reduced model do not predict the results from the full model when the mechanism to reduce WEC is by decreasing adult worm fecundity. For this mechanism  the rate of change in the frequency of the  allele in worms was negative at most frequencies of the  allele in sheep. Hence the  allele is mostly unfavourable for the worms. This arises because selection pressure is reduced for this mechanism  as observed in Table . The results from Figure  suggest that most features of the host-parasite interaction that were considered in the full model  including the between-host distribution of worms  have little impact on the rate of adaptation in worms. However  when sheep reduce WEC by reducing worm fecundity  a slower rate of adaptation in worms is predicted. Notably  although the rate of change in the frequency of the  allele in worms is lower when WEC is reduced through the fecundity mechanism compared to other mechanisms  the rate of loss for the  allele in the susceptible population ( = 0) is similar for all four sets of results. This property is best explained with reference to the gene-by-gene interaction defined in Table . If only susceptible  sheep are considered  then worm fitness is only determined by the value of . This parameter is constant for this scenario regardless of the mechanism and hence Figure  shows the same rate of loss for all unselected sheep. The sex-limited action of the fecundity mechanism only affects the relative fitness of the worm genotypes when  is greater than zero. In effect  the sex-limited action halves the values of  in Table . This changes the balance for fitness between worm genotypes  leading to results for the fecundity mechanism being different from results for the other mechanisms. The flock average WEC measurements showed the clear effect of a reduction in WEC with increasing frequency of the  allele in the sheep population for each of the resistance mechanisms (Figure  and Table ). However  the WEC for sheep flocks in which the  allele was fixed (i.e.  = 1.0) was much lower than that estimated by the effect of the resistant allele. That is  the homozygous  genotype sheep had a WEC of 40% to 60% of the  sheep in Table  but the WEC of the  flock was 20 to 30% of the  flock (using the average of years 1 to 5) in Scenario 5. This difference is primarily driven by the within-year effects on pasture contamination. For example  the ‘susceptible’ sheep flocks from Table  have an initial WEC of ~700 epg  while the  animals from Table  have a WEC of ~475 epg. The susceptible flock from Scenario 5 has a higher WEC because pasture contamination for the flock is higher (i.e. there are no sheep with the  genotype  while in Scenario 4 all three genotypes contribute to pasture contamination) and the mortality on pasture for worms is lower because the frequency of the  allele in worms is lower (i.e.  is 0.3 in Scenario 5 compared to 0.5 in Scenario 4). In Scenario 5  an additional ~ 25% reduction in WEC is observed in an  flock ( = 1) because of reduced worm burden and larval intake arising from lower larval contamination from low WEC sheep and increased mortality for  allele worms on pasture.  Mechanism by which sheep reduce WEC are () reduced worm establishment or () increased worm mortality; the frequency of the low WEC  allele in sheep was investigated at 11 levels  from low (light blue) to high (dark blue) frequencies and also when the allele is absent (black). Notably  the WEC in flocks for which obvious adaptation occurred (e.g. the  = 1.0 flock from Figures B and B) did not recover to the level seen in  sheep flocks ( = 0). This is because the  worm allele suffers a survival penalty on pasture in our simulations  lowering the number of infective larvae on pasture when the worm population has an increased frequency of the  allele. Thus  although worms improve survival by adapting to sheep with  genotype  overall fitness for worms with the  allele remains lower than wild-type worms in susceptible sheep because of the allele’s pleiotropic effects. Changes in WEC over time were generally a poor indicator of adaptation because of its high annual fluctuations (Figure ). The annual fluctuations are not due to variation in environmental factors such as climate (these parameters were constant) but are likely caused by random processes in the model  such as daily variation in feed intake. Although the significant regression of WEC on time indicated quantifiable adaptation  reflecting the increase in the frequency of the  allele (Table )  the changes in WEC were rather small and noisy. For example  significant adaptation was indicated when the  allele reduced establishment for the  = 0.1 and 0.3 flocks but not for the intermediate  = 0.2 flock. As above  the increase in WEC was sometimes associated with a loss of the  allele because of its pleiotropic effects on pasture survival. It is unlikely that this magnitude of change in WEC would be observable under field conditions  where the level of larval challenge varies across years  and changes are further masked by climatic fluctuations. This paper examined the conditions required for adaptation of worms at a single locus to sheep with an allele that confers low WEC  and tested two hypotheses related to rates of worm adaptation. For the former  our model was set up with specific conditions to facilitate adaptation of worms to host genotype by including interactions between sheep and worm genotypes (i.e. Table ). This is necessary because when an allele in the worm consistently has favourable (or unfavourable) effects and no interaction with the genotype of the sheep  it would always be under positive (or negative) selection and  thus  such an allele could not be responsible for adaptation to specific sheep genotypes (i.e. low WEC sheep). Hence  we used a gene-for-gene model where the genotypes of sheep and worms could interact. The second requirement for adaptation is that worms need genetic variation at this locus. This variation could be through either  or segregating variants. However   mutations are  by definition  initially rare alleles and we found that they may require many generations in the worm population before an appreciable change in allele frequency is observable. Furthermore  these alleles are quickly subjected to natural selection and purged if unfavourable. We found that the mutations that remained segregating after several generations of exposure to sheep had very specific values for their survival advantage and trade-off. Only mutations for which the survival advantage in sheep was precisely balanced by their detrimental pleiotropic effects remained segregating in the long term. Our model assumed the detrimental effects comprised reduced survival on pasture but  equally  these effects could have occurred elsewhere in the lifecycle of the worm. Thus the basic requirements for adaptation in our model were presence of loci in the host and worm that interact and genetic variation in both the worm and host locus. The presence of genetic variation suitable for adaptation of worms to sheep with improved resistance is unknown. A high degree of molecular polymorphism is observed in worm populations [  ] and this variation could be equated with adaptive potential. Our results  particularly from Scenario 2  suggest that polymorphisms in worms with appreciable frequencies (and therefore ‘old’ mutations segregating in the population) are likely neutral  or near neutral  for overall worm fitness. This is because worms have infected sheep for many generations and natural selection will have had opportunity to maximise worm fitness. Polymorphisms that segregate in worm populations could affect fitness if they were younger  and thus exposed to fewer generations of natural selection  or if  for example  they have transient effects on fitness []. However  the persistence of these polymorphisms will be inversely related to their net effect on fitness because any allele with strong beneficial effects will be rapidly fixed. Our model explored antagonistic pleiotropy as a mechanism to maintain polymorphism in worms and  although experimental evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy at individual loci is scarce []  Jørgensen [] reports reduced survival (larval development) for worms at the population level in a line of sheep selected for low WEC. The presence of polymorphisms in worms with antagonistic effects on survival is unknown but our model demonstrates that such a mechanism may be required to maintain polymorphism at a locus with properties suitable for adaptation of worms to sheep genotype. Without pleiotropy  natural selection rapidly purges unfavourable alleles from the worm population and genetic variation is lost at the locus. We expect that most of the observed molecular polymorphisms in worms will have small effects on worm fitness but recognise that segregation of alleles with antagonistic pleiotropy or of young mutations with near-neutral effects on fitness remain a possibility. The final requirement for worm adaptation to sheep genotype is selection pressure. That is  there must be a difference in survival between worm genotypes that depends on sheep genotype. In our model  selection pressure depended on the survival advantage and trade-off for the allele at the interacting locus in the worm (allele ) and the allele frequency at the interacting locus in sheep (allele ). Our model behaved in predictable and consistent ways across all scenarios with respect to worm adaptation (i.e. the change in the frequency of the interacting worm allele  ). Results from Scenario 5 showed that  for a specific mutation  flocks with extreme frequencies of the interacting allele in the host ( = 0 or  = 1 for allele ) led to the most rapid rate of adaptation. This was because  under the conditions of Scenario 5  the  allele remained segregating in the worm population after several generations when  0.5 and frequencies of either  = 0 or  = 1 caused the most disruption in this balance. The requirements for an interacting locus  i.e. genetic variation and selection pressure  should also apply to other host-pathogen systems. Given the ‘ideal’ starting conditions for worms to adapt  we were able to test two specific hypotheses with our model. The first hypothesis tested if the (non-genetic) features of the host-parasite interaction slowed the observed rate of adaptation. Some features  including a skewed distribution of WEC in sheep  overlapping generations of worms and a reservoir of worm larvae on pasture  primarily impacted the generation interval of worms. Thus  after calibrating the outputs by generation interval in the worm  a simpler reduced model was able to accurately predict the results from the full model that included key host-parasite interactions. The reduced model showed that the outcome for the  allele in worms is essentially determined by the selection pressure per generation  i.e. the selection differential for each sheep genotype and the proportion of worms exposed to each sheep genotype  and by the generation length for the worm. Accurate estimates of these two parameters are important to apply these findings to other host-pathogen systems  although in practice this is not a trivial exercise. An important outcome of the model was that limiting female fecundity as the mechanism by which selection of sheep reduces WEC was found to halve the selection pressure on the worm population compared to other mechanisms for WEC reduction. This was because of the sex-limited action of this mechanism  whereby a female worm that is able to overcome the  allele in sheep has its favourable genotype diluted by mating with unselected male worms. Experimental evidence also suggests an important role for reduced worm fecundity in low WEC sheep [  –]  where WEC in sheep with immature immune responses seems to be suppressed by reduced worm fecundity rather than a (partial) reduction in total number of worms. Other host-parasite systems also suggest slower adaptation when hosts reduce pathogen reproduction (or infection rate) as compared to pathogen numbers. For example  modelling in malaria shows imperfect vaccines that limit pathogen growth (i.e. numbers) are more likely to cause an evolutionary response in the pathogen compared to an infection-blocking mode of action []. Quantitative support for this prediction is evident in the successive adaptation of the Marek's disease virus to repeated releases of vaccines that limit tumor growth rather than viral reproduction or propagation [  ]. Here  we make a similar favourable conclusion about mechanisms that limit pathogen reproduction  as compared to pathogen numbers  but our results are obtained through the sex-limited action of the fecundity mechanism  in contrast to other studies  which exploited within-host competition between pathogen strains as mechanism for adaptation. The second hypothesis investigated whether WEC could be used to detect adaptation in worms. We found that WEC over time was very noisy  even in the idealised situation of constant environmental conditions. There was evidence for adaptation by an increase in WEC over time  but in some parameter sets worms adapted by losing the favourable  allele  i.e. by reducing their ability to parasitize sheep carrying the  allele but improving their ability to survive on pasture. Thus  an increase in WEC over time did not necessarily imply that worms had improved their ability to parasitize sheep. The observed increase in WEC was also smaller than naively expected  i.e. WEC did not increase to the same level as in susceptible ( = 0) sheep  even when worms completely fixed the favourable  allele. This occurred because the antagonistic pleiotropy of the worm  allele. Thus  although worms improved their ability to parasitise sheep by increasing the frequency of the  allele  they also reduced their survival on pasture  therefore lowering larval intake  worm burden and WEC of sheep. Our conclusions of course depend on the assumptions used in our model  i.e. the properties of the interacting loci in sheep and worms (Table )  which represent our understanding of the processes involved in adaptation. For the source of genetic variation in worms  we make a distinction between segregating and  mutations  where the former has implicit restrictions on the effects of polymorphisms present in worm populations because of natural selection. We expect  mutations to add genetic variation each generation and  given the large effective population size of worms  this may be a substantial contribution. For example  Barton [] argued that it is possible to observe a specific nucleotide substitution in each generation of the worm population  assuming a population of 10 individuals (i.e. a mutation rate of 10/3  where 10 is the mutation rate per nucleotide and there are possible three nucleotide substitutions). However the forces that act on  mutations are the same as we have modelled for segregating mutations  except that the allele frequency for  mutations is very low. Hence the selection differential for the worm population in each sheep genotype and the proportion of the worm population exposed to this selection pressure will determine if a new mutation persists  and the rate at which it will increase in frequency should it persist. However to facilitate differential adaptation (i.e. adaptation specifically to sheep with  genotype)  these new mutations still require them to have favourable effects on worm fitness and increase in frequency in low WEC sheep but be unfavourable (or neutral) in sheep that are not selected. To complete our findings  several issues need to be further studied. The first limitation of our model is that we consider only a single interacting locus. Fisher’s infinitesimal model (a very large number of loci each with a negligible effect) and recent experimental evidence suggests that WEC in sheep is a highly polygenic trait []. It might be expected that presence of multiple loci affecting WEC would reduce the selection pressure acting on each worm locus  although this is yet to be rigorously explored. Secondly  a suitable method to test for adaptation  in theory and practice  might be to measure WEC in a cross-factorial design with artificial infection e.g. []. This approach should limit the impact of antagonistic effects on the detection of adaptation because each sheep would be exposed to the same larval intake  but it does negate effects that accumulate during the season. Finally  the ability of worms to adapt to anthelmintics should be comparable to adaptation under the framework we have established. It is well known that worms can adapt to anthelmintics e.g. [] and at first sight this outcome differs from results presented here. However the selection pressures placed on worms by anthelmintic administration are much greater than those exerted by host genetic effects. These factors can be accounted for through the available parameters and are the subject of ongoing research. Our model suggests that detectable adaptation of worms to sheep that are selected for low WEC is unlikely in the short term. This is because mutations in the worm that have properties suitable for adaptation  i.e. mutations that are favourable for survival in low WEC sheep but unfavourable in unselected sheep  may take many generations to increase in frequency or are likely to be neutral (or near neutral) with respect to overall worm fitness in the current population. Even when we assumed ideal conditions and adaptation was observed in our model  the expected increase in WEC as a result of adaptation was small relative to the temporal fluctuations in the trait and also small relative to the reduction in WEC expressed by the sheep. The selection pressure applied to the worm population was a key factor for worm adaptation  with the selection differential between worm genotypes and the proportion of the worm population exposed to the selection pressure (i.e. the frequency of the low WEC allele in sheep) being key parameters.

This management method  which detects the ‘purest’ individuals to be used as parents for the next generation  allowed recovery of the native genetic background to a great extent in all simulated scenarios.

Genome-wide information can be used to identify the purest individuals via the minimisation of molecular coancestry between individuals of the admixed and exogenous populations. Removal of the undesired genetic material is more efficient with a molecular-based approach than with a pedigree-based approach. Depending on the situation  crossbreeding can be considered as a positive or negative process for the management of populations. Many studies have analysed the benefits of a new genetic input: gene flow between populations can offset the loss of genetic diversity and avoid the deleterious consequences of inbreeding[  ]. However  exchange of genetic material can have disadvantages. Introgression can lead populations to extinction  a phenomenon more likely to occur today because the number of invasive species threatening wild populations has considerably increased due to human activities[  ]. In the field of domestic animals  maintaining pure populations can be essential either to secure quality characteristics of livestock products[] or to breed animals for other economic reasons such as horse breeds for competitions[] and dog breeds for aesthetic reasons[]. Livestock breeds are important components of the world’s biodiversity[]. Local breeds have been selected to fit a wide range of environmental conditions and human needs. The genetic diversity of livestock breeds represents a reservoir to select for new characteristics in response to changes in environment  to diseases  or to new demands in food quality or quantity. Intensive selection of a few highly productive breeds has caused the decline of numerous other breeds that often possess special adaptive characteristics (to harsh conditions  disease resistance  etc.) not found in the former[  ]. In many cases  crossbreeding between a local breed and a more productive breed leads to the disappearance of the specific features and adaptive traits of the local breed. Therefore  they should be recovered to avoid population extinction[–]. In a previous study  we used pedigree data as source of information to remove introgressed genetic material and recover the native genetic background[]. Different introgression events were simulated with a varying number of exogenous individuals entering the population and different numbers of generations during which exogenous genetic material was admixed. Based on information from a completely recorded genealogy  this method optimised the genetic contribution (i.e.  number of offspring) of the available candidates to minimise coancestry between individuals of the current population and the foreign founders. As a result  the candidates with the lowest proportion of exogenous material were favored to produce a higher number of descendants. The strategy proved to be the best method to remove undesired introgression when relying on genealogical information but had some disadvantages  such as increased inbreeding in the population. Moreover  in cases for which the level of introgression was too high or uncontrolled during many generations  the method was relatively inefficient. In a study on the preservation of the genetic background of three cattle breeds  Wellmann et al.[] also used pedigree information. Although their objective was slightly different  the method constrained exogenous genetic contributions and reduced the probability of identity by descent in the offspring to comparable levels. In most realistic scenarios  reliable pedigree information is lacking and using molecular information is the only option. In the last decades  molecular markers have become a standard tool to characterize the genetic variation of populations (farmed and natural). Analyses of this molecular variation help to set priorities in conservation programs  to improve traceability in livestock  to estimate genetic diversity among breeds  etc.[–]. In a simulation study[]  the information of a few microsatellite-like markers was used to remove undesired introgression through the calculation of genetic distances between the admixed and pure populations or by direct selection of individuals carrying private alleles exclusive to the native population. In all cases  the success was related to the differences in allelic frequencies between exogenous and native populations. In situations in which only a few markers with very similar allele frequencies in both populations were available  the efficiency decreased considerably. Progress in genotyping techniques has increased the number of available markers and made it possible to use marker information in a wide variety of analyses. The availability of dense molecular marker maps covering the whole genome can provide a more precise picture of the genetic background of a population than pedigree information. Some studies have investigated whether molecular marker information can be a substitute to genealogical information. Hayes et al.[] demonstrated that replacing the relationship matrix derived from pedigree data with a realised matrix (calculated through genome-wide information) in BLUP analysis  can increase the accuracy of breeding values. De Cara et al.[] showed that molecular information from high-density markers is more efficient than pedigree data in population management schemes aimed at maintaining genetic diversity using minimum coancestry contributions. The objective of this study was to analyse  through computer simulations  the consequences of substituting pedigree coancestry with molecular coancestry  calculated from genome-wide marker information  for the removal of exogenous genetic material from an introgressed population. Computer simulations comprised three stages: (1) generation of the two original populations (i.e.  native and exogenous); (2) introgression of exogenous individuals into the native population followed by random mating of the resulting offspring for a variable number of generations; and (3) management of the admixed population to recover the genetic background of the native population. Native and exogenous populations included 100 individuals each (50 males and 50 females) and the genome of each individual was made up of 20 chromosomes  each one Morgan long and carrying two types of biallelic loci: 2500 markers and 25 000 non-marker loci. All loci were equidistant and markers were evenly spaced between the non-marker loci. Initially  frequencies of alleles at each locus (marker and non-marker) were 0.5/0.5 in both populations. To create offspring  random mating was applied in both populations during 100 discrete generations maintaining a constant population size and sex ratio and crossovers were assumed to occur at random along the chromosomes (with no interference) and to follow a Poisson distribution (<U+03BB> = 1). As a result  allelic frequencies (with a U-shaped distribution due to drift) were divergent between populations and loci were in linkage disequilibrium with a different pattern in each population. The 2500 markers per chromosome were used in the management of the removal of exogenous background. The non-marker loci were used only for evaluation (not for management)  as alleles originating from the native population were distinguishable from those originating from the exogenous population. Therefore  the non-marker loci allowed evaluation of the percentage of genome of each individual that originated from native versus exogenous ancestors  and thus  evaluation of the efficiency of the de-introgression process. After generating the native and exogenous base populations  two introgression scenarios were simulated. To form the admixed population  10  20  30  40 or 50 exogenous individuals were added to the native population maintaining the total number of individuals at 100 over generations. Individuals were mated randomly during one to five discrete generations (Figure).  Left: Scenario involving one introgression event. Right: Scenario involving several introgression events. In this scenario  10  20 or 30 exogenous individuals were added to the native population at each generation for one to five discrete generations (same number at each generation) without management. The population size was kept constant ( = 100) over generations. In generation 1  the non-exogenous individuals originated from the native population and in subsequent generations from the already admixed population (see Figure). Equivalences in total percentage of introgression between the two scenarios are shown in Table . After creating the admixed populations  10 generations of population management were simulated to eliminate the exogenous genetic material. Molecular coancestry based on marker genotypes was calculated between individuals of the current population and the exogenous individuals that were introduced in each generation. A correction was applied to account for marker similarity between individuals in the native and exogenous base populations. Let  be the genotype of individual  at SNP  with the values \"0\" if the individual is homozygous for allele 1  \"1\" if the individual is heterozygous and \"2\" if the individual is homozygous for allele 2. Then  the standardised genotype  of individual  at SNP  is[  ]: where  is the frequency of allele \"1\" at marker  in the base population (i.e.   = 0.5). A matrix   composed of  values is constructed for individuals in the current and exogenous populations and the matrix of genomic relationships between current () and exogenous () individuals is calculated as: where  is the total number of markers. To eliminate exogenous genetic material  at each generation of management  contributions of individuals to the next generation (i.e.  number of offspring generated by each potential parent) were calculated by minimising an objective function which includes the relationship between current and exogenous individuals: where  is the relative contribution of individual  to the next generation and  is the sum of the genomic relationships between individual  and all the exogenous individuals obtained from equation (). This genomic relationship is equivalent to the molecular coancestry based on identity by state  and standardised. Since calculation of the genomic relationship  is based on many markers  it becomes impossible to have two individuals with the same value. For this reason  minimising the expression in equation () selects just one male and one female  i.e.  those with the minimum values of . To avoid this  the following restriction was applied: each possible parent in the population could only contribute 10 offspring (of any sex) resulting in 20 equally contributing parents (10 males and 10 females) at each generation  which implies a theoretical rate of inbreeding () of 0.0125 (assuming random selection and mating). After selection of the 20 parents  they were mated randomly to create the next generation. To further analyse the implications of the number of individuals contributing to the next generations  a new set of simulations was run  with a maximum number of offspring per individual at each generation of management equal to 5 (resulting in 40 equally contributing parents  theoretical  = 0.006). These simulations were run only with the scenario involving a single introgression event. Molecular coancestry between individuals in the current and exogenous populations as calculated above considered that genotypes were available for all exogenous individuals. Since this is not always a realistic situation  a new set of simulations was performed in which genotypes were available for only 50% of the exogenous individuals. In this case  management minimised molecular coancestry between individuals in the current population and half of the exogenous individuals that entered the population. Again  these simulations were run only with the scenario involving a single introgression event. Another set of simulations was performed to investigate a situation in which the individuals that had been used for introgression may not be available but the foreign population from which they originated may be still maintained. A scenario involving a single introgression event but with a percentage of introgression varying between 10 to 50% and five generations of admixture was simulated. In parallel  the foreign population was randomly run for a variable number of generations (the same as in the admixture process). Then  molecular coancestry between individuals of the admixed population and the pure exogenous individuals of this foreign population was calculated and used to remove the exogenous genetic material. In all cases  the number of genotyped descendants and the number of exogenous individuals that originally entered the population were identical. For every generation  two variables were calculated to evaluate the efficiency of the strategies: native genetic representation and average inbreeding coefficient. Native genetic representation is the percentage of native genetic material recovered after one or ten generations of management estimated by the fraction of alleles originating from the native breed based on information from non-marker loci. Native genetic representation relates with the objective of the method itself. Average inbreeding coefficient based on pedigree information reflects the loss of genetic diversity due to the de-introgression process. The rate of inbreeding was calculated for all generations of native and exogenous populations and during admixture and management periods as: The increase in inbreeding accumulated over the ten generations of management is given by : Twenty replicates per scenario were simulated and the results presented are averages across replicates. The percentages of native genetic material recovered after one or ten generations of management with the scenario involving a single introgression event (maximum number of offspring per individual = 10) are shown in Figure (upper panel). A notable recovery of native genetic background was obtained by minimising coancestry with the exogenous individuals calculated from information on marker genotypes.    Native genetic representation is the percentage of native genetic material recovered after one or ten generations of management (upper panels);  is average inbreeding coefficient in the first generation and  is the increase of inbreeding over ten generations of management (lower panels) in the one introgression event scenarios (maximum number of offspring per individual = 10); () with one non-managed generation; () with three non-managed generations; () with five non-managed generations. In cases involving just one generation of admixture or minimal introgression  removal of the exogenous genetic material was almost completely achieved in just one generation of management. With increasing percentages of introgression (and/or durations of admixture)  more generations of management were required to reach the maximum value. Compared to the results obtained using pedigree data (only in the scenarios with five generations without management  see Figure)  the method based on marker data performed markedly better to remove the exogenous genetic material. However  with the pedigree-based method  the maximum level of removal was achieved in just one generation of management[]  thus on this time scale  it is more efficient. With the molecular-based method  an equivalent level of removal to that obtained with the pedigree-based method was achieved only at the second generation of management (not shown)  but it continued to increase in subsequent generations. Thus  marker-based management continued to remove exogenous alleles from the population and after 10 generations of management  the overall result was better than with pedigree-based management. The observed  with the scenario involving a single introgression event (maximum number of offspring per individual = 10) is shown in Figure (lower panel) after one generation of management  as well as the increase in inbreeding accumulated after ten generations of management (). The greater increase in  compared to expectations for unmanaged populations is a general consequence of the reduction in the number of contributing individuals with the removal method. Notwithstanding  the restriction imposed on the maximum contribution per breeding animal allowed the method to control this increase. Even when including a restriction on inbreeding   was higher than the theoretical value of 0.0125 in the first generations of management  during which the level of removal was greater. This is due to the fact that the 20 contributing individuals are probably more related to each other than average individuals. This also explains why  is higher for scenarios in which recovery of native genetic material is less easily obtained. After a few generations  the maximum removal was almost achieved and the population had more homogeneous coancestry with the exogenous individuals. At this time  observed  was close to the theoretical value (data not shown). The more generations the method required to recover the native genetic background  the higher was the total increase in inbreeding.  values obtained with the pedigree-based management and the molecular-based management used here cannot be directly compared. In the pedigree-based method  the algorithm chose solutions with a larger number of contributing parents when several solutions with the same value of global coancestry existed. Therefore  there was an unspecific limitation of inbreeding  but no control over the individuals contributing as in the present study[]. The performance of pedigree-based management was better (lower  values) when introgression was between 10 and 20% and both management systems became similar for medium and high levels of introgression (30 to 50%). Table  shows the percentages of native genetic material recovered and the values of  for the scenarios in which the number of offspring per individual in each generation of management was set to 5. The increase in inbreeding was smaller than that obtained in the previous simulations  as expected  which is due to the larger number of contributing individuals. The recovery of native genetic background was lower in most of the scenarios  but exogenous material could still be completely removed if the number of generations of admixture was low. Figure (upper panel) shows the percentages of native genetic background recovered after one or ten generations of management in the scenario involving several introgression events. In this case too  recovery of native genetic background was substantial and reached 100% in the scenarios with a lower level of introgression.    Native genetic representation is the percentage of native genetic background recovered after one or ten generations of management (upper panels);  is average inbreeding coefficient in the first generation and  is the increase of inbreeding over ten generations of management (lower panels) in the several introgression scenarios (maximum number of offspring per individual = 10); () with two non-managed generation; () with three non-managed generations; () with four non-managed generations; () with five non-managed generations. As observed in the scenario involving one introgression event  native genetic material was recovered to a large extent after one generation of management  especially in cases with a low level of introgression. With higher levels of introgression  more generations were necessary to achieve maximum recovery. Comparison of equivalent cases between scenarios including one or several introgression events  (i.e.  same total percentage of introgression and same number of generations of admixture  see Table ) showed that  although values are in the same range  the amount of native genetic material recovered was greater with the scenario involving several introgression events than that with a single one. As in the previous section   was larger than the theoretical value in the early generations (Figure) and decreased to the expected value of 0.0125 in the later generations (not shown). The values of  were similar to those obtained in the scenario involving a single introgression event when maximum removal of introgressed genetic material was achieved (Figure). Table  shows the results of the performance of the de-introgression process for the scenario involving a single introgression event and in which only 50% of the exogenous individuals were genotyped. The results show that coancestry between only a few individuals is sufficient to detect exogenous genetic material and to remove it. The recovery level was only slightly lower and involved a lower increase in inbreeding in all cases than when all the genotypes were known. Table  shows the results of the performance of the de-introgression process when using genotypes of descendants of the exogenous population to recover the native genetic background. The level of recovery of native genetic material was slightly smaller in all cases but very similar to that obtained using the original exogenous individuals and the increase in inbreeding was lower due to this loss of efficiency. Benefits of crossbreeding are known and have been widely used in conservation genetics of wild species and livestock[  ]. However  disadvantages have also been pointed out relating to economic and conservation issues highlighting the benefits of maintaining the purity of some populations[–]. Many local breeds have become endangered or extinct because of crossbreeding with more productive breeds[]. The disappearance of such breeds is potentially detrimental to the genetic basis of livestock production  specifically in the case of particular adaptive characteristics to respond to changes in the environment or market[  ]. Actions to preserve these breeds are taken worldwide  but if an undesired introgression event happens it will be necessary to recover the original background and develop methods to cope with this situation. The number of genetic markers available for various livestock and non-farmed species has considerably increased in recent years  reaching 770 000 SNP for cattle. High-throughput genotyping technology has led researchers to reconsider the advantages of using pedigree information versus genotyping data  apart from when pedigree information is completely absent. Genotyping data can successfully replace pedigree information to estimate relationships when marker density is sufficiently high[  ]. In a previous study  we investigated the efficiency of recovering a native genetic background after introgression by exogenous individuals using a method based on information from a completely recorded pedigree. We showed that small inputs of exogenous alleles can rapidly spread into the population and that it can become very difficult to completely recover the original genetic background. Pedigree information allowed recovery of native genetic background in some situations but at the cost of a high increase in inbreeding[]. In the present study  we carried out several simulations to test the usefulness of molecular marker-based methods to remove exogenous genetic material. Marker information was used to calculate molecular coancestry that replaced pedigree-based coancestry. Removal of exogenous genetic material present in an admixed population using molecular data was successful  particularly when the level of introgression was low. The marker-based strategy led to a higher de­introgression level than the pedigree-based strategy since it detected more efficiently the exogenous genetic material[]. Improvements can reach up to 15% (compared to using genealogical information) proving that genome-wide information can be more useful and effective to recover native genetic material after an introgression event. Similarly to the pedigree-based strategy  the values of  obtained with the marker-based strategy showed that each generation of removal increased inbreeding. This suggests that the de­introgression method should be applied for as few generations as possible to avoid the inbreeding effect. In the scenarios with limited introgression  the method required only a few generations to achieve the maximum level of removal of exogenous genetic material. Moreover  the results obtained when the number of offspring is restricted shows that a solution can be found if a high level of  cannot be tolerated  while still recovering a large part of the native genome. Before beginning the management process  it is necessary to determine what the acceptable level of increase in inbreeding is  and to apply a restriction on this level to allow for some control on genetic diversity. Once recovery of the native genetic background is completed  the management process should aim at minimising the inbreeding rate using  for example  Optimum Contributions management[  ]. As Wellmann et al. pointed out[]  one objective could be to recover a large number of native alleles at high frequencies. In this case  individuals with a high percentage of exogenous genes but native alleles not present in the rest of the population should also contribute. Our objective was to completely remove the exogenous genetic material  but genotyping information could also be used to design a breeding program to maximise some specific regions of the genome or combination of alleles. In such cases  a compromise between genetic diversity and removal of exogenous genetic material can be found and implemented. When the same percentage of exogenous alleles was added to the population progressively (i.e.  through several introgression events)  the percentage of native genetic material recovered was higher than with the scenario including a single introgression event. This shows that the period of time between when introgression takes place and when removal begins is an important factor. In the scenario involving several introgression events  part of the introgression occurs later than in the scenario with a single introgression event and  thus  the exogenous material is easier to remove. Other approaches based on marker genotypes have also been shown to be useful to recover an introgressed population[]. Using information on private alleles led to a substantial recovery of the native background  but required a large number of molecular markers with alleles exclusive to one population  which is not usually the case. Genetic distances were useful when dealing with markers with several alleles  but only in cases for which allelic frequencies were sufficiently different between the native and exogenous populations. Our results are similar or even better (regarding the percentages of native genetic material recovered) than those from studies using private alleles or genetic distances in all comparable scenarios. In addition  if only part of the exogenous individuals is available  they can be used to minimise coancestries and to recover the purest background. Moreover  information on the descendants of the exogenous population instead of the actual exogenous individuals entering the native population can help identify the purest individuals to achieve a high level of recovery of the native genetic material. Again  the efficiency of the removal of exogenous material using partial information would depend on the genetic differentiation between the two admixed populations. The availability of genome-wide information for natural populations is not yet as widespread as for farmed animals  thus our method is expected to be more easily applied in the latter. However  recent progress in next-generation sequencing approaches makes it possible to identify SNP in species without a reference genome[  ] thus these techniques should become feasible for wild species in the near future. Knowledge on the original frequencies of the alleles in the populations is required to correct the genotypes as shown in equation (). These frequencies should be estimated in the pure population (when still available). If the reference populations are not large  the sampling variance can be corrected as done in other methods to calculate the genomic relationship matrix  e.g.  Yang et al.[]. Besides genealogies and molecular markers  phenotypic characteristics can be used in livestock to characterise a breed. Phenotypes can also be applied to de-introgression as in Fernández et al.[] and will result in the recovery of certain regions of the genome linked to morphological traits whereas the genome-wide molecular markers provide information all over the genome. Thus  the genetic management approach presented here is flexible and can use alternative sources of information and be applied for different objectives. Genome-wide information can be used to remove introgressed genetic material and to completely recover the native genetic background when the contribution of the exogenous population is limited to 30-40% and the number of generations of admixture is not too high (one to three generations). Molecular coancestry proved to be an effective tool to recover native genetic material and even more efficient than pedigree information[] or information on a small number of markers[]. Each situation is different and needs to be carefully studied  but even with relatively few SNP  molecular coancestry can be calculated and used in the absence of proper pedigree information for de-introgression. Regardless of the possibilities for recovering a native genetic background  when dealing with introgression it is essential to minimise undesirable exogenous inputs of genetic material as much as possible  because the de-introgression process involves an increased rate of inbreeding that can represent a significant cost for an endangered breed.

This strategy was shown to be particularly useful for populations with lower levels of linkage disequilibrium  for genomic selection on traits with low heritability  and for species or breeds for which the size of the reference population is limited. Prediction of breeding values of animals using genomic information was proposed by Meuwissen et al. [] and since then the way breeding programs of livestock are conducted has changed considerably. Due to recent advances in genotyping technologies  the amount of genomic information available for genomic selection (GS) has increased from a few thousand [] to 50k [] and 800k [] single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and today tends towards whole-genome sequence []. The population structures observed in many livestock species are often characterized by large full- and half-sib families  and by the presence of animals (especially males) with a very large number of progeny. These conditions make it possible to infer the genotype of an un-genotyped individual using genomic information from its family members  which is usually referred to as pedigree-based imputation. High levels and extents of linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been reported in livestock populations  such as cattle []  sheep []  chickens []  pigs [] and horses []. The presence of high LD between markers can be used to infer the genotype at an un-genotyped locus based on available genotypes at neighbouring markers  which is usually referred to as population-based imputation. Such features make it possible to impute genotypes at untyped markers in a larger panel of markers from genotypes obtained with a smaller panel. In order to reduce genotyping costs  much effort has been put on developing methods and software to impute genotypes at high-density chips from animals genotyped at low-density chips [–]. Accuracy of imputation may vary depending on the source of information being used to infer the genotypes and also on population structures. Hayes et al. [] investigated the success of imputation from 5 k to 50 k genotypes in four sheep breeds and reported accuracies ranging from 71 to 80% depending on the breed. Erbe et al. [] used the software BEAGLE [] without pedigree information to impute genotypes at 800 k SNPs from dairy bulls genotyped at 50 k and reported accuracies of imputation (defined as the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes) ranging from 0.96 to 0.98 in Jersey and Hosltein cattle  respectively. Meuwissen and Goddard [] applied a method for imputing whole-sequence genotypes on individuals genotyped at a low density panel and reported that 10% of the missing genotypes were erroneously imputed. In principle  an increase in marker density should result in higher LD between the markers and the quantitative trait loci underlying a given trait  and consequently in more accurate genomic predictions. However  the advantage of using a high-density panel for GS compared to a low-density panel depends on which markers are included in the low-density panel. Such a formulation can be interpreted in terms of variable selection in a linear model  which has been a topic of frequent research aiming at reducing over-parameterisation in statistical models for GS [  ]  as well as making the implementation of a genomic breeding program more cost-effective []. Based on simulation analyses  Habier et al. [] showed that low-density marker panels could be used in GS with a limited loss in accuracy compared to that achieved with high-density panels. According to a study using dairy cattle data by Weigel et al. []  moving from a set of 300 markers to a set of 2000 markers represented a gain in accuracy of ~30% or ~113%  depending on how the subsets of markers were selected (with largest effects or equally spaced). When moving from 2000 to 32 518 markers  gains in accuracy were only ~8% or ~13%. There is further empirical evidence that the relationship between gain in accuracy and increase in marker density tends to reach a plateau. VanRaden et al. [] reported an average difference in accuracy of only 0.4% between predictions from a 50 k and a high-density (777 k) chip. As suggested by the results from VanRaden et al. []  an increase in the number of animals in the training set should be more effective for improving the accuracy of genomic predictions than increasing the number of markers  especially when there is evidence that the benefit from increasing density tends to reach a plateau. Many of the studies done with imputation so far have focused on the increase in density of markers panels through imputation and its impact on accuracy of genomic predictions. Results from Weigel et al. [] in Jersey cattle indicated that if a suitable reference population genotyped with a 50 k chip is available  genotyping selection candidates with a 3 k instead of a 50 k chip and then imputing the remaining genotypes would result in a loss of predictive ability of only 5%. Dassonneville et al. [] also studied the effect of genotyping selection candidates either with a 50 k or with a 3 k chip followed by imputation and reported losses in reliability ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 in Holstein cattle. Erbe et al. [] used dairy cattle data to investigate the impact on the accuracy of genomic predictions of an increase in marker density from 50 k to 800 k through imputation  and reported an average gain in accuracy of 0.01 in Holsteins and 0.03 in Jersey cattle. Imputation can be used to increase the number of markers. However  the benefit is expected to reach a plateau beyond a certain density. Imputation can also be used to increase the size of the training set with animals that were not genotyped at all. Cleveland et al. [] investigated the impact of imputation on genomic predictions  and compared a training set of fully genotyped males and females with a training set in which only males were genotyped and females were imputed. An alternative and interesting analysis would be to compare the accuracy achieved in a training set with only genotyped males to that achieved with a training set containing the imputed females as well. A situation somewhat similar to that was investigated by Pszczola et al. []  who compared a training set of genotyped bulls with a training set enlarged by imputed bulls. They used an additive relationship matrix relating genotyped to un-genotyped bulls to perform the imputation and reported an accuracy of imputation of 0.59  but the inclusion of the imputed bulls in training did not increase the accuracy of genomic prediction. This may be explained by the fact that the un-genotyped (imputed) bulls in their population had no offspring and the highest degree of relationship between them and the genotyped bulls was half-sib or parent-offspring. Imputation may be improved if the un-genotyped individuals to be imputed are defined in a specific design such that genotypes can be inferred with higher probabilities. For instance  imputation is likely to be more accurate when genotyped close relatives are available []. In some applications of GS  this may occur naturally. For example  when a training set is created for GS on traits that are expressed only in females  as for new traits in dairy cattle for which the cows’ phenotypes are difficult to measure (e.g. []) and/or for which accurate conventionally estimated breeding values of bulls are not yet available as an alternative response variable. In most livestock species  the number of males used for breeding is usually limited  thus when a reference population of males is in an advanced stage (as in the dairy industry  for example) most of the intensively used breeding males have probably been already genotyped. We consider a situation where a reference population of females is created and all or most of their sires and maternal grandsires have been already genotyped. In such cases  there is a considerable amount of family information available that can be used to try to infer the genotypes of the dams of these females. The configuration of the genotyped family members in this specific design should allow a much better quality of imputation of the un-genotyped dams than when performing imputation in a general framework on subjects from a pedigree with variable levels of relationships to the genotyped individuals. Although specific  this design is relevant since it will naturally arise in all future applications of genomic selection for new phenotypes. The objectives of this work were: (1) to investigate the performance of two imputation methods for a completely un-genotyped dam  using the information on its genotyped family members and the mating partner plus the estimates of either allele or haplotype frequencies; (2) to investigate the effects of different population structures  levels of LD and distribution of allele frequencies on the success of imputation; and (3) to evaluate the impact of enlarging a training set with imputed dams on the accuracy of genomic predictions for different populations  levels of heritability (h) of the trait under selection and sizes of training sets already available. In the approach presented here  the aim was to impute the genotype of a completely un-genotyped dam. It is assumed that the genotypes of its sire  of one offspring and of this offspring’s sire are available. These three animals will be referred as MGS  Offspring and Sire. The situation is illustrated in Figure . Assume a bi-allelic locus with alleles coded as allele  and allele . Let the frequency of allele  in the population be p and the frequency of allele  be q. In some cases  depending on the genotype configuration of the genotyped relatives and the mating partner and disregarding the probability of mutation  the genotype of the dam can be inferred unambiguously. For example  if the MGS is   the Offspring is  and the Sire is   then the dam must have inherited an allele  from the MGS and given an allele  to the Offspring. Therefore one can infer that the dam’s genotype is  with probability 1. In some other cases  inference about the dam’s genotype cannot be made unambiguously  but with a probability that is lower than 1.   -  The first imputation procedure (referred to as the Single_Step method) uses the information from the MGS  Sire and Offspring genotypes and allele frequencies to infer the dam’s genotypes for all loci  unambiguously or not. For each genotype configuration of the MGS  Offspring and Sire  each possible genotype of the dam can be assigned a probability  which in the ambiguous cases can be expressed as a function of the allele frequencies. These probabilities for each case were derived and are available in Additional file : Table S1. Calculation was done following Bayes’ theorem. Let the set of all three possible genotypes in a locus be  and M  S  O and D be the genotypes of the MGS  Sire  Offspring and Dam. The posterior probability of the Dam’s genotype was then calculated as: The second imputation procedure is done in two stages and therefore will be referred to as the Two_Step method. In a first step  only the Dam genotypes that can be inferred with probability 1 are assigned (see Additional file : Table S1) and whenever the probability is lower than 1  the Dam genotype is set to missing. In a second step  the genotyping data from the Dam  containing assigned and missing genotypes  are combined with all available genotyping data from the MGS  Offspring and Sire  and missing genotypes are filled in using LD information. The second step was carried out using the software fastPHASE [] for haplotype reconstruction and inference of missing genotypes. To assess the efficiency of the two methods described above  imputation of Dam genotypes was also performed using two currently available imputation programs: findhap.f90 Version 2 [] and AlphaImpute Beta 1.16 []. For the comparison of imputation methods  genomic data were simulated using the software QMSim []. The simulated genome consisted of one chromosome of 100 cM  on which 2000 bi-allelic markers (coded as alleles  and ) were randomly allocated. Marker allele frequencies in the first historical generation were set equal to 0.5 and the mutation rate was set to 2.5e-5. In order to generate different genomic structures that may influence the success of imputation  four populations were simulated  which differed in the level of LD and the presence or absence of selection. The increase in the level of LD desired for two of the populations was induced by simulating a bottleneck in the historical population. Therefore  the four scenarios were created as follows: no bottleneck and no selection (LowLD_NoSel)  no bottleneck and selection (LowLD_Sel)  bottleneck and no selection (HighLD_NoSel)  and bottleneck and selection (HighLD_Sel). For each of the four scenarios  10 replicates were simulated. To generate a minimum level of LD for the two scenarios without bottleneck  a historical population of 4000 animals was mated at random for 1600 discrete generations  without selection  without migration and with an equal number of animals from both genders. Then the population size was increased to 4040 in the following 20 generations and kept at a constant size for 20 additional generations. For the two scenarios with bottleneck  the historical population was initially set to 2000 animals and mated at random for 2500 generations. After this  a bottleneck was simulated by gradually decreasing the population size to 200 animals over the following 70 generations; these 200 animals were further mated at random for 10 generations. The population size was then gradually expanded from 200 to 4040 animals within the next 20 generations  and remained at a size of 4040 for 20 additional generations. In all four scenarios  population size was 4040 in the last historical generation  which included 40 males. Starting with the 4000 female and 40 male founders from the last historical generation  10 additional generations were simulated to form the recent population. In the recent population  the proportion of male offspring was 0.5  litter size was 1  a random mating design was applied and replacement ratios for sires and dams were 0.5 and 0.25  respectively. These parameters were common to all four scenarios. For the two scenarios without selection  a random selection design was used and the culling design was based on the age of the animal. For the two scenarios with selection  both selection and culling designs were based on estimated breeding values (EBV). These EBV were obtained by solving Henderson’s mixed model equations [] using pedigree information and phenotypic records from a trait with h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20. Since the proportions of female and male offspring were identical  the last generation of the recent population contained 2000 female offspring. Genotype imputation was then performed on the dams of these 2000 female offspring from the last generation. To investigate the impact of imputation on the accuracy of genomic predictions  the size of the training set used for SNP effect estimation is a relevant parameter. For that purpose  the same simulation procedures described above for the four scenarios were applied again in another simulation  in which a larger population was generated at the end. Instead of using a size of 4040 for the last historical generation  the number of female founders was set to 32 000 so that 16 000 female offspring in the last generation were available for the imputation of their dams. As above  10 replicates of each scenario were simulated for the larger populations. Outputs from QMSim included information about the paternal and maternal alleles of each locus  which allowed the determination of linkage phase and the calculation of haplotype frequencies. The level of LD in the four simulated scenarios could then be assessed by calculating the squared correlation coefficient (r) between each pair of markers in the last generation. To minimize the influence of the minor allele frequency (MAF) on the measure of LD  r values were computed only for pairs of markers with a MAF greater than 0.05. The decay of LD with increasing inter-marker distances was also assessed by calculating the mean r within bins of inter-marker distances. The impact of the imputation of Dam genotypes on the accuracy of genomic predictions was investigated for the imputation method with the best performance. For that purpose  the simulated data sets with 16 000 female offspring in the last generation were used. Four different sizes of training sets to estimate marker effects were created by splitting each replicate into subsets containing 2000  4000  8000 and 16 000 female offspring. From each subset  90% of the animals were assigned to the training set and the remaining 10% to the validation set. Accuracy of genomic prediction was then assessed by cross-validation  i.e. marker effects were estimated with data from animals in the training set and used to predict genomic breeding values of animals in the validation set. The sizes of the training sets containing only genotyped animals (TS) were 1800  3600  7200 and 14 400. Training sets augmented (TSA) with imputed Dams were created  resulting in training sets of 3800  7600  15 200 and 30 400 animals. The impact of imputation was evaluated by comparing the accuracies of genomic predictions using TS or the corresponding TSA. To generate different levels of heritability (h)  different magnitudes of residual terms were added to the simulated true breeding values  generating phenotypic values representing ten levels of h  ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05. For each size of training set and each h  allele substitution effects of every locus on the simulated phenotypes were fitted in a multiple random regression model similar to the GBLUP method of Meuwissen et al. []. Estimated SNP effects were calculated from the following mixed model equations: where µ is an overall mean;  is the vector of allele substitution effects;  is a vector of ones  of order equal to the number of animals in the training set;  is the matrix of SNP genotypes  coded as the number of copies (or dosage) of allele   of the animals in the training set;  is the vector of phenotypes;  is an identity matrix of order equal to the number of markers and <U+03D5> is an assumed ratio of residual to marker variances. This ratio of variances was calculated using the simulated h values and assuming a marker variance equal to the additive variance divided by the number of markers. For each scenario and replicate  only markers with a MAF greater than 0.05 were used in the estimation of SNP effects. Genomic breeding values were then predicted as   where  is the matrix of SNP genotypes  coded as the number of copies of allele   of the animals in the validation set. Accuracy of genomic evaluation was calculated as the correlation between GEBV and the simulated true breeding values of the animals in the validation set. An overview of the level and the decay of LD with inter-marker distance for the four simulated populations used to compare the imputation methods is presented in Table . Bins of distance are expressed in kb assuming that one Mb is equivalent to one cM. As intended  the level of LD in the scenarios simulated with a bottleneck in the historical population (HighLD_) was higher than in the scenarios without bottleneck (LowLD_). Selection was also a factor that increased the overall level of LD  and even more strongly the extent of LD over larger inter-marker distances. In the scenarios without selection  LD decreased much more rapidly than in the scenarios with selection. At an inter-marker distance of 200–500 kb  the mean r was less than one third of the mean r at an inter-marker distance smaller than 25 kb  whilst in the scenarios with selection it was still more than a half of that (Table ). Plots of all pair-wise values of r against inter-marker distance for all replicates of the four scenarios are provided in Additional file : Figure S1. The different population structures simulated in the four scenarios not only affected the pattern of LD  but also caused different shapes of the distribution of allele frequencies. Histograms of the frequencies of allele  for all replicates of the four scenarios are provided in Additional file : Figure S2. In the LowLD_NoSel scenario (the one with the lowest level of LD)  the distribution of allele frequencies was bell-shaped  with a much higher frequency of markers with intermediate allele frequencies compared to markers with extreme allele frequencies. In the HighLD_NoSel scenario  the distribution was more uniform  with a slightly higher frequency of markers with extreme allele frequencies. Selection caused a higher frequency of markers with extreme allele frequencies  especially in the scenario HighLD_Sel. Variability in the distributions across replicates was large in the scenarios LowLD_Sel and HighLD_Sel  whilst a very uniform pattern was observed in the LowLD_NoSel and HighLD_NoSel scenarios. The level of LD directly affects the performance of the Two_Step method  since information on haplotype frequencies is used by fastPHASE to impute the missing genotypes. The Single_Step method does not use LD information but its performance will be affected by the different shapes of the distribution of allele frequencies  since the genotypes of markers with more extreme allele frequencies are easier to impute. The success rates of imputation (defined as the percentage of correctly imputed genotypes) for each imputation method and each scenario  averaged across replicates  are presented in Table . Mean success rates ranged from 0.70 to 0.85 in the Single_Step and from 0.60 to 0.80 in the Two_Step method. Pszczola et al. [] simulated a dairy cattle population and imputed genotypes on completely un-genotyped bulls in a mixed model approach using the additive relationship matrix  and reported an accuracy of imputation of 0.58. In their approach  imputation was performed using only information from related genotyped animals  and the highest degree of relationship between genotyped and un-genotyped animals in their simulated population was half-sib or parent-offspring. Cleveland et al. [] investigated genotype imputation on dams in the training set in a simulated population. Their method used segregation analysis and information on haplotype frequencies  and they reported a success rate of 69% when dams were completely un-genotyped. Nevertheless  the available family information for each dam in their training dataset did not exactly correspond to the situation considered in our design  as shown in Figure . Overall  the Single_Step method performed better than the Two_Step method for the four simulated scenarios. As expected  the quality of imputation with the Two_Step method increased with higher levels of LD. A similar trend was observed with the Single_Step method. Although LD information is not directly used in the Single_Step method  its performance was influenced by the level of LD since the simulated populations with a higher level of LD presented distributions of allele frequencies with greater densities at more extreme allele frequencies (see Additional file : Figure S2). At any given locus  the quality of imputation with the Single_Step method depends on the probability with which the Dam’s genotype can be imputed. As can be seen in Additional file : Table S1  this probability is a function of the allele frequencies at the locus and the genotype configuration of the MGS  Sire and Offspring. The larger the number of loci for which the genotype can be imputed with a probability of one  the higher is the expected proportion of correctly assigned genotypes to a given Dam. The number of unambiguously assigned genotypes is expected to have an even greater impact on the quality of imputation with the Two_Step method. This number defines how many loci can be assigned in the first step  which is the only step where information on genotypes of the MGS  Sire and Offspring is used. In order to better assess the dependency of the relative success rate of each method on the number of unambiguously assigned genotypes  Dams were grouped in three classes according to the number of loci imputed with a probability of one: less than 100 loci  between 100 and 300 loci  and more than 300 loci. Distributions of the number of unambiguously imputed loci per Dam for all replicates of the four scenarios are provided in Additional file : Figure S3. The average success rate within each group for each replicate is shown in Figure  for each of the four simulated scenarios. As expected  the larger the number of genotypes that could be inferred with a probability of one  the higher the quality of imputation for both methods. A similar relationship between success rate and proportion of alleles inferred without ambiguity was also reported by Hickey et al. []. In our study  this effect was more pronounced with the Two_Step method because Dams with no or very few assigned genotypes in the first step move to the second step with all or almost all genotypes set to missing. Imputation in the second step is then based exclusively or mostly on haplotype frequencies alone. Weigel et al. [] masked different proportions of SNP genotypes in some animals from a data set of Jersey cattle and used fastPHASE to impute them. They reported mean success rates ranging from 0.66 to 0.72 when 1 to 2% of genotypes were available. Mean success rates increased to 0.75 to 0.88 when 5 to 10% of genotypes were available and to 0.90 to 0.94 when 20% of the genotypes were available. These success rates are similar to those observed in our HighLD_ scenarios (Figure ). The average numbers (percentage) of unambiguous loci per Dam were 159.3 (8.0%)  154.5 (7.7%)  107.6 (5.4%) and 99.9 (5.0%) for LowLD_NoSel  LowLD_Sel  HighLD_NoSel and HighLD_Sel  respectively. Nevertheless  these 5 to 8% of genotypes inferred unambiguously that were made available to fastPHASE in the second step are in general different SNP between Dams. The average success rate with the Single_Step method was greater than with the Two_Step method for all groups of Dams. The difference in performance of the two methods was larger for lower levels of LD and for a smaller number of loci that could be inferred in the first step of the Two_Step method (i.e.  the number of unambiguous cases). The higher the level of LD  the closer the performance of the two methods  especially for the group of Dams with more than 300 loci inferred in the first step. This illustrates a higher dependency of the Two_Step method on the level of LD. In the scenario with the highest level of LD (HighLD_Sel)  the success rates of both methods were almost the same for the group of Dams that had more than 300 unambiguously inferred genotypes. Even for the simulated scenario with the highest level of LD  the Two_Step method did not outperform the Single_Step method. This indicates that  for the specific design considered here (Figure )  the probabilities derived from family information used in the Single_Step were more useful to infer genotypes at ambiguous loci than LD information. For the unambiguous loci  the two methods are exactly the same. A difference is observed only when all genotype probabilities at the locus are lower than 1. Depending on the MAF at the locus and the genotypic configuration of the MGS  Sire and Offspring  the most probable genotype from Single_Step method may still be associated with a posterior probability that is higher than could be inferred based on haplotype frequencies alone.    Each data point is the mean percentage within Dam class in a given replicate. Classes correspond to number of genotypes unambiguously inferred: blue square (lower than 100)  green circle (between 100 and 300) and red triangle (greater than 300). The average success rate for both methods of imputation for Dams that had more than 300 unambiguously inferred genotypes in the HighLD_Sel scenario was ~0.92 (Figure ). This proportion is similar to what one would expect to achieve when moving from a low density to a higher density panel of markers e.g. [  ]. In both approaches described here  this level of success rate could be achieved for completely un-genotyped Dams. The Two_Step method could be compared to imputation from low to high density (e.g.  3k to 50k)  in which first a ‘low density chip’ is built based on the unambiguous cases and then the rest is filled in with LD information. However  three main differences must be pointed out: (i) the Two_Step method starts from completely un-genotyped animals; (ii) after the first step  Dams have genotypes for a ‘low density chip’ but with a different chip for each Dam and not a set of evenly spaced markers common to all Dams; and (iii) information on the genotyped relatives is used only in the first step  which means that after the ‘low density chip’ is built the only information available for imputation is LD  whereas in a low to high density approach  one would still have the possibility of using family information. Obviously  if a low density panel of SNP was also available for these Dams  the average success rate would be even greater  but at the cost of genotyping the Dams for the low density chip. Inspection of the number of genotypes which can be imputed unambiguously may provide an approximate estimate of the expected success rate that may be achieved by imputation. Such an estimate could then be used as an aid to choose the Dams to be genotyped with a low density chip. In the case of a group of Dams  for which say 10 or 15% of the loci can be unambiguously inferred from family information alone  one could choose to leave them completely un-genotyped and do imputation with the Single_Step method. Knowledge about the population structure under consideration (e.g.  level of LD and distribution of allele frequencies) would also be required in such a decision process. In order to account for that  simple experiments (e.g.  genotyping and imputing a small number of Dams) could be conducted to empirically estimate the expected success rate for Dams with a given number of loci inferred with a probability of one. One aspect of the imputation procedures proposed here is that genotypic information is assumed to be available on a specific set of animals (Figure )  including one offspring. These methods can  however  be extended to situations in which a number of genotyped offspring are available  which should considerably improve the quality of imputation. Such improvement would be expected for both methods  since a larger number of offspring would most likely result in a larger number of unambiguous cases. According to the algorithm described in Additional file : Table S1  the genotype at each locus can be assigned to be    or . For genomic selection purposes and according to how marker genotypes are modelled (i.e. as a covariate representing the number of copies of a given allele)  genotypes at each locus can also be assigned a continuous value within the range 0–2. Instead of the number of copies of allele   genotypes are defined as allele  dosage. This definition avoids loss of information caused by rounding the genotype to one of the three classes. Allele dosages for each genotype configuration of the MGS  Sire and Offspring as a function of allele frequencies were derived and are provided in Additional file : Table S2 (this version will be further referred to as the Single_Step*). Since our aim was to compare the results with those obtained with other software  which  in some cases  construct imputed genotypes as the sum of allele probabilities (e.g.  AlphaImpute)  genotypes were imputed as allele dosage. Quality of imputation in this case was assessed via the correlation coefficient between real and imputed allele dosages  and will be further referred here as the accuracy of imputation. Evaluating the quality of imputation in this way also has some advantages compared to the success rate  for the reasons pointed out by Hickey et al. []. Accuracy of imputation from all methods and software are presented in Table . Imputing an allele dosage instead of assigning the most probable genotype resulted in a gain in accuracy from 2.3% (HighLD_Sel) to 6.4% (LowLD_NoSel). Imputation accuracies from findhap.f90 were lower than accuracies from Single_Step* and Two_Step. The algorithm implemented in findhap.f90 is a combination of pedigree haplotyping and population haplotyping. Our results indicate that the amount of genotyping information available in the situation considered here (i.e.  MGS  Sire and Offspring) seemed to be insufficient for the pedigree haplotyping algorithm to satisfactorily impute a completely un-genotyped Dam. Many other studies reporting performance results from findhap.f90 applied the program with the main purpose of imputing genotypes from low to high density chips [    ]. In such cases  findhap.f90 can take more advantage of the population haplotyping algorithm because of the observed genotypes from the low density chip and may perform imputation with an accuracy greater than 0.95. To resemble an application with a small chip  we performed another series of imputation runs with findhap.f90  in which Dams had genotypes for 125 evenly spaced markers. Average imputation accuracies from findhap.f90 when moving from the sparse (125) to the dense (2000) set of markers were 0.96 (LowLD_NoSel)  0.98 (LowLD_Sel)  0.97 (HighLD_NoSel) and 0.98 (HighLD_Sel). These numbers are not comparable to the results in Table . They are rather used to illustrate the magnitude of accuracy expected when imputation is applied to move from low to high density chips  which also indicates a strong dependency of the performance of findhap.f90 on the number of unambiguously imputed loci. Accuracies of imputation from AlphaImpute were higher than from the Two_Step method  especially in the LowLD scenarios. In some cases  although the complete genotypes cannot be inferred unambiguously  one can at least be sure about the presence of one of the alleles. This piece of information is neglected by the Two_Step method  since when moving from the first to the second step  the only information available for haplotype reconstruction are the unambiguous genotypes. An improvement in imputation accuracy from the Two_Step method could be achieved if known alleles were also taken into account in the haplotyping step. This information seems to be more efficiently used by the algorithm implemented in AlphaImpute  which is a combination of long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation. Results from AlphaImpute were similar to results obtained with Single_Step*. In the LowLD scenarios  AlphaImpute performed better and in the HighLD scenarios  results from Single_Step* were better. The strength of AlphaImpute is its flexibility  since it can handle different levels of relationship between the surrogate and the genotyped animals. The strength of the Single_Step* method is its simplicity and ease of programming  which enables very fast imputation. Since the difference in performance was smaller in the LowLD than in the HighLD scenarios and the intended application was for the specific situation considered here  Single_Step* was the method of choice to investigate the impact of imputation on accuracy of genomic predictions. An overview of the level and the decay of LD with inter-marker distance for each of the four simulated populations used to investigate the impact of imputation on the accuracy of genomic predictions is presented in Table . Trends are quite similar to those in Table . Augmentation of TS into TSA was done by imputing Dams’ genotypes using the Single_Step* method. Correlations between GEBV and true breeding values in the validation set using either TS or TSA to estimate SNP effects are shown in Figure  for the four simulated scenarios and for different h and numbers of offspring. As a general trend  accuracy of genomic predictions increased with increasing h and increasing sizes of training sets. This is consistent with the formula proposed by Daetwyler et al. []  in which the expected accuracy of genomic prediction with GBLUP is calculated as a function of the number of animals in the training set  h and the number of independent chromosome segments. The simulated population structure also had an impact on prediction accuracy. As expected  accuracies on average increased with increasing levels of LD observed from scenario LowLD_NoSel to scenario HighLD_Sel. These differences between scenarios are also consistent with the formula of Daetwyler et al. []  in which they suggest calculating the number of independent chromosome segments as a function of the genome length and the effective population size  following Goddard []. These parameters should in turn vary for different genome and population structures  with different levels of LD and distributions of allele frequencies. All correlation coefficients between the GEBV and true breeding values in the validation set obtained with TS and TSA for all simulated scenarios  h and numbers of offspring are provided in Additional file : Table S3. Although the imputation accuracies were smaller for Single_Step than for Single_Step*  the accuracies of genomic breeding values using either method were almost identical (differences were smaller than 1% on average) and show exactly the same pattern as for Single_Step* (results not shown).    Red surfaces represent accuracies obtained with TS (90% of the progeny in the training set) and green surfaces represent accuracies obtained with TSA (90% of the progeny<U+2009>+<U+2009>the imputed Dams). An increase in the accuracy of GEBV was observed when using TSA instead of TS  which demonstrates that enlarging a training set with imputed Dams represents an advantage. The extent of this advantage differed between the different population structures simulated. In the LowLD_NoSel scenario  the gain in accuracy  expressed as percentage of the accuracy with TS  ranged from 3.7% to 37.1%. The benefit of incorporating imputed Dams in the training set was overall larger for this scenario  despite the fact that with this scenario genotype imputation was performed with the poorest quality. In the other three scenarios  the maximum gains were 11.1% (LowLD_Sel)  15.3% (HighLD_NoSel) and 11.9% (HighLD_Sel)  and the minimum gains were close to zero. Because imputation is not perfect  the increase in accuracy obtained with TSA was generally lower than what could be achieved by enlarging TS with another set of genotyped offspring. For each of the four scenarios  we compared the increase in accuracy obtained when: (1) enlarging TS by doubling the number of genotyped offspring; or (2) enlarging TS with imputed Dams. For example  in the LowLD_NoSel scenario with an h of 0.05  moving from a TS of 1800 to a TS of 3600 offspring gave a gain in accuracy of 32% (from 0.31 to 0.41). Adding the 2000 imputed Dams to a TS of 1800 offspring (i.e.  a TSA of 3800 animals) gave a gain in accuracy of 23% (from 0.31 to 0.38)  which is 72% of the gain in the first case and reflects the fact that the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes of Dams is lower than 1. On average  across all h and numbers of offspring  the gain in accuracy in the second case was 93% (LowLD_NoSel)  62% (LowLD_Sel)  78% (HighLD_NoSel) and 63% (HighLD_Sel) of the gain in accuracy obtained in the first case. The first case would require doubling the costs by genotyping another set of offspring  whereas in the second case  no additional costs for genotyping are needed. If there is funding available for genotyping more animals  then increasing the size of the training set with genotyped animals should improve the accuracy of genomic predictions more. Different strategies can be used to genotype more animals  e.g. genotyping for a low density chip the Dams with very few loci for which imputation can be unambiguously made  as pointed out in the previous section. Nevertheless  according to our results  even if all available funding for genotyping has been spent  there is still room for an additional improvement in genomic predictions by enlarging TS with imputed Dams. The magnitude of the gain in accuracy when moving from TS to TSA varied not only between scenarios but also for different values of h and numbers of offspring already available in TS. The effects of h  number of offspring and simulated scenario on the difference between accuracies obtained with TS and TSA were all significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Pszczola et al. [] added 1000 imputed bulls to a training set of 1000 genotyped bulls and did not find any significant increase in accuracy of genomic predictions. The authors attributed their finding to the low accuracy of imputation in their study (0.58). Nevertheless  Pszczola et al. [] reported a trend of increasing difference in accuracy with decreasing h  which is consistent with our results. The population of Pszczola et al. [] was simulated to resemble a dairy cattle population with a considerably high level of LD (average r of 0.41 between adjacent markers  which were on average 0.13 cM apart). This level of LD is higher than that observed in our scenario with the highest LD (HighLD_Sel)  in which the increase in accuracy of genomic predictions was overall the lowest in our study. This agrees with our indication that the impact of enlarging a reference population with imputed individuals in terms of accuracy of genomic prediction depends on the population structure under consideration. Generally  the larger the accuracy already obtained with TS  the lower is the increase in accuracy achieved with TSA. Regression analyses of the percentage increase in accuracy obtained with TSA against the accuracy already obtained with TS across all h and numbers of offspring for the four scenarios were performed. Results fitted a negative linear relationship well  with coefficients of determination of 0.80  0.88  0.68 and 0.85 for scenarios LowLD_NoSel  LowLD_Sel  HighLD_NoSel and HighLD_Sel (Additional file : Figure S4). This pattern was not only observed when moving from TS to TSA  but also when moving from a smaller to a larger TS. This can also be seen in the shapes of the surfaces presented in Figure   in which the increase in accuracy resulting from an increase in either h or the number of offspring tends to reach a plateau. Genotypes of a dam’s sire  one offspring and this offspring’s sire  as well as estimates of marker allele frequencies were used to impute genotypes of dams with an accuracy  i.e. the correlation between observed and imputed genotypes  ranging from 0.81 to 0.93. Accuracy of imputation was higher in populations with higher levels of LD and with distributions of allele frequencies containing a larger proportion of markers with more extreme allele frequencies. Overall  inclusion of imputed dams in the training set increased genomic predictions  up to 37%. The impact of enlarging the training set with imputed dams on the accuracy of genomic predictions depends on the heritability of the trait  on the number of animals in the already available training set  and on the population structure. Besides being useful for reducing costs of genotyping by imputing high-density panels on animals genotyped with low-density panels  imputation can also be used to achieve an extra increase in accuracy of genomic predictions by enlarging the training set with completely un-genotyped dams. This strategy is particularly useful for populations with low levels of LD  for genomic selection on traits with low h  and for species or breeds for which the reference population size is limited.

Retraining is expected to reduce the advantage of the dominance model over the alternatives  because in general  the advantage becomes important only after five or six generations post-training. Under dominance and without retraining  genomic selection based on the dominance model is superior to the additive model and the breed-specific allele model to maximize crossbred performance through purebred selection. Numerous studies have shown encouraging results of applying genomic selection (GS) in purebred populations [–]. However  except for dairy cattle  most animals used in livestock production systems are crossbreds  with advantages of heterosis and breed complementarity. For such systems  the breeding goal in purebreds should be to optimize the performance of crossbred descendents. GS has advantages in selection for crossbred performance over conventional methods [–] as reported in []. In particular  training on crossbred data for GS accounts for genetic differences between purebred and crossbred animals and genotype by environment effects. Different GS models have been proposed and used to select purebreds for crossbred performance [–]. In most studies  additive gene action or perfect knowledge of gene substitution effects or both have been assumed. It has been argued that dominance is the likely genetic basis of heterosis [  ]  therefore explicitly including dominance in the GS model may be beneficial for selection of purebreds for crossbred performance. Allele substitution effects are a function of additive and dominance effects  and of allele frequencies []. In the case of crossbred records  Dekkers [] proposed a model that fits breed-specific allele substitution effects (BSAM)  where the substitution effects at the QTL (quantitative trait loci) for paternal and maternal alleles would be different if the parental breeds differ in allele frequencies at the QTL. It has been shown that  when additive and dominance effects of the QTL are known without error  BSAM can give greater response to selection than the usual additive model that fits a common substitution effect for each QTL [  ]. When the QTL genotype is not observed and marker genotypes are fitted in the model  linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and the QTL may not be consistent between the parental breeds. This difference in LD will also contribute to differences in allele substitution effects between breeds. When SNP effects must be estimated  the advantage of fitting BSAM over the additive GS model was not always observed under additive inheritance []  which suggests that differences in LD between breeds may not be as important as the presence of dominant gene action in practice. Dekkers [] showed that  to maximize performance in the first generation of crossbreds  the allele substitution effect for an identified QTL must be derived based on allele frequencies in the selected mates. However  allele frequencies of selected mates cannot be observed prior to computation of the substitution effects that are needed for selection. Thus  Dekkers [] proposed an iterative algorithm to compute substitution effects based on selected mates. A model that explicitly includes dominance effects (the dominance model) provides estimates of both additive and dominance effects and therefore enables the computation of allele substitution effects using appropriate allele frequencies. Once estimates of SNP effects are obtained from training  they can be successively applied over generations with updated allele frequencies to develop prediction equations specific to that generation. The BSAM model gives allele substitution effects for each parental breed that depend on allele frequencies among individuals from the other breed that were used to produce the training population. It is not straightforward to apply the iterative algorithm of Dekkers to BSAM. In addition  the substitution effects from BSAM cannot be used to recompute the appropriate substitution effects in the subsequent generations  as allele frequencies change due to selection. Furthermore  breed origin of SNP alleles must be known or inferred for the BSAM model [  ]  but such knowledge is not needed for the dominance model. The primary objective of this study was to assess the performance of the dominance model in comparison with the additive model or BSAM for GS on purebreds for crossbred performance. Substitution effects from the dominance model were computed based on allele frequencies of unselected mates. Ibáne~z-Escriche et al. [] compared BSAM to the additive model under additive gene action alone and Kinghorn et al. [  ] made this comparison with dominant gene action when QTL effects were assumed known. Thus  a secondary objective of this study was to compare BSAM to the additive model under dominance when SNP effects must be estimated. Model performance was evaluated by computer simulation based on response to 20 generations of selection in a two-way crossbreeding program. Comparisons between the dominance  BSAM and additive models were made for four scenarios of gene action. To clearly detect an advantage of including dominance in the model  the dominance variance  and heterosis  were chosen to be large in scenario 1  allowing for overdominance. In scenarios 2 and 3   and  were restricted to more realistic values with (scenario 2) or without (scenario 3) overdominance. In scenario 4   was reduced to zero to examine any disadvantage of using the dominance model when gene action is purely additive. Changes to  and  were achieved by changing the size and proportion of beneficial dominance effects. Other parameters  including locus positions and LD between loci and allele frequencies were held constant between the four scenarios. A total of 16 random simulations were carried out for each scenario. A genome was simulated with either one or ten chromosomes. Each chromosome was one Morgan and consisted of 100 randomly distributed QTL and 1000 SNP markers that were almost evenly spaced. All loci were biallelic with starting allele frequencies of 0.5 and a reversible mutation rate of 2.5×10. A binomial map function was used to model recombination with interference on a chromosome []. A base population of 500 unrelated individuals was randomly mated for 1000 discrete generations to create LD between loci in the founders of different breeds. The additive effect  of a QTL is defined as half the difference in genotypic value between alternate homozygotes and the dominance effect  as the deviation of the value of the heterozygote from the mean of the two homozygotes []. Bennewitz and Meuwissen [] evaluated QTL mapping results from many studies in pigs for meat quality and carcass traits and concluded that an exponential distribution with rate parameter 5.81 is an adequate “generating mechanism” for the absolute values of the additive effects of QTL. That distribution was used here to generate the unsigned value of the additive effect for each QTL  and a positive or negative sign was assigned to each additive effect with equal probability. Although the relationship between additive and dominance effects of QTL has been studied [–]  a consistent relationship has not been observed. Thus  in scenarios 1 and 2 with overdominance  we assumed  for simplicity  that the dominance effects were independent of additive effects. The absolute values of dominance effects were independently sampled from the same exponential distribution as was used for the additive effects. This was considered reasonable because the exponential distribution has a high probability for the occurrence of small effects  which is also plausible for dominance effects. In scenario 3 with no overdominance  the dominance effect of a QTL was sampled from a uniform distribution that ranged from zero to the absolute value of the QTL’s additive effect. In order for the trait to manifest positive heterosis  only 30% of the sampled dominance effects were negative in scenarios 1 and 2  and this fraction was further reduced to 20% in scenario 3 for the sake of no overdominance. The resulting distribution of dominance coefficients  defined as the ratio of the dominance effect over the absolute value of additive effect  was similar to what has been observed for real data []. The QTL effects were scaled (as described in AppendixAppendix A) such that the relative contributions of the additive and dominance effects to the genetic variability of the trait were 2:1  4:1 and 1:0 in the scenarios where  was set to be large  realistic or null  respectively. After scaling  40-45% of QTL showed partial dominance and 30-35% overdominance when overdominance was present. Trait phenotypes were simulated by adding a standard normal residual effect to the genotypic value of each animal. The variance of the residual effects was chosen such that broad sense heritability  of the trait was 0.5 in the founders. As a result  narrow sense heritability  was 0.33 for the scenario with large   0.4 with realistic   and 0.5 with <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. Breeds A and B were simulated by randomly sampling 100 animals from the founders in generation -55 and random mating for 54 additional generations to mimic recent breed formation (Figure ). In the founder generation  100 QTL and 1000 SNPs were randomly chosen from those with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.1. To guarantee that the number of such loci to choose from would be sufficient  five times as many loci were simulated in the base population. This procedure ensured that most QTL chosen to define the trait and SNPs chosen for inclusion in the analysis segregated in both breeds.  The crossbreeding program consisted of 20 generations of purebred selection for crossbred performance; crossbred AB is the training population; A and B represent the selected breed A and B males  A and B the selected breed A and B females; lines with arrows denote reproduction  while lines without arrows denote selection. In generation -1  the genetic disparity between breeds was due to differences in LD and in allele frequencies. Averaged over simulations  the heterozygosity of each breed was about 0.3  and the mean difference in allele frequencies between breeds was about 0.3. In each simulation  while the same set of QTL characterized the trait  the contribution of QTL effects to the phenotypic variability differed between breeds due to disparities in allele frequencies. Between simulations  the observed values of variance components in a given breed varied due to genetic drift during the 54 generations of random mating after breed separation. In livestock  dominance can explain up to about 10% of phenotypic variation [] and heterosis from a breed cross can be up to 10% []. In scenario 1  where  was large   was on average 16.7% in the pure breeds and  was on average 31%. Under more realistic settings  % and % in scenario 2  where overdominance was allowed  and % and % in scenario 3  where overdominance was not allowed. When the genome was extended from one to ten chromosomes  these values were kept about the same by reducing the proportion of beneficial dominance effects. A two-way crossbreeding program with 20 generations of selection was simulated  as illustrated in Figure . The goal was to improve crossbred performance through selection in both parental breeds  starting from 1000 animals of sire breed (A) and 1000 animals of dam breed (B) in generation 0. The selection criteria was the rank of the individual’s genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). The SNP effects for the prediction of GEBV were estimated only once  using 1000 crossbred AB animals in generation 0. These estimates of SNP effects were then repeatedly applied to predict GEBV in the following 20 generations of selection. In generation 1 through 20  600 animals were selected from 1000 candidates in each parental breed based on their GEBV  of which the top 100 were used as males and the other 500 as females. As described in detail later  with the dominance model  GEBV were based on the breed-specific allele substitution effects that were recomputed for each generation  using allele frequencies in the opposite breed in that generation. The selected animals were randomly mated within each breed to produce 1000 purebred replacement animals for the next generation. Meanwhile  the 100 selected males of breed A were also randomly mated to the 500 selected females of breed B to produce 1000 crossbred progeny. The phenotypic mean of crossbreds was computed in each generation of selection (AB – AB) to evaluate the cumulative response to selection. Starting from the same set of purebred selection candidates in generation 0  the subsequent 20 generations of selection were repeated 100 times to increase power to detect differences between the GS models in cumulative response. A mixed linear model (see Appendix B) was used to test for differences between GS models by generation 20. Note that the 16 random simulations each with 100 repetitions account for differences in purebreds due to genetic drift. In sum  the collected data consisted of 1600 observations in each generation of selection. The cumulative response in the  generation of selection  where <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  …  20  was computed as where  is the phenotypic mean of crossbreds in generation  and  is the phenotypic standard deviation of crossbreds in generation 0. The following mixed linear model was used to estimate SNP effects assuming additive gene action: where  is the phenotype of animal    is the overall mean   is the copy number of a given allele of SNP  centered by the mean   is the allele substitution effect for SNP   and  is the residual effect for animal . The prior specification for model parameters and the sampling strategy followed the BayesC  method proposed by []. In order to concentrate the signal and reduce noise  only a proportion of SNPs was assumed to have a non-null effect. Conditional on   the variance of random substitution effects for all SNPs   had a mixture prior of a normal distribution and a point mass at zero: The proportion  of SNPs that have null effects on the trait was considered unknown  with a uniform prior between 0 and 1. A scaled inverse Chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom <U+2009>=<U+2009>4 and scale parameter  was specified as a prior for . The value of  was chosen based on the following relationship between the expectation of a scaled inverse Chi-square variable and its scale parameter: and  was obtained following [] such that   where  is the total number of SNPs   is the chosen probability that a SNP has no effect prior to the analysis  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>-<U+2009> is the allele frequency  and  is the additive genetic variance for the trait that is explained by all SNPs. The residual  had a normal prior with variance also following a scaled inverse Chi-square distribution:  and   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>4. The value of  was obtained from (2)  with   where  is the residual variance that cannot be explained by the SNPs. True values were given to  and  in this study. The dominance model  as shown below  simultaneously fits additive and dominance effects of SNPs: where      are as defined in the additive model   is the indicator variable for the heterozygous genotype of SNP  that is centered by its mean   is the additive effect  and  the dominance effect for SNP   and  is the residual. Given the assumption that epistasis is absent  the residual term in the dominance model only contains non-genetic effects  while that of the additive model also includes dominance deviations. The model specification for the dominance model is similar to that of the additive model. Conditional on  (the probability that  is zero) and  (the variance of  when it is nonzero)  the prior for  is a mixture of normals  as given in the additive model (1). Similarly  the prior for  is also a mixture of normals  given  and   with corresponding definitions. However  in order to account for the directionality of dominance  the normal component of the prior for  has an unknown nonzero mean : For convenience  the prior of  was assumed to depend on the variance: where  is our prior belief about  and  is the “prior sample size”  which expresses the strength of the prior belief in terms of . Here   was set to 10  a small number relative to 100 QTL  to allow the data to “dominate” the posterior distribution of . The value of  was chosen as described below. Let the allele frequency at SNP  be  in sires and  in dams in generation -1. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the parental populations  heterosis () in the training crossbred AB is a function of the dominance effects and the difference in allele frequencies in the parental populations () []: Assuming independence between dominance effects and allele frequencies and ignoring selection  this can be written as where  is a chosen value for the proportion of SNPs that have nonzero dominance effects. Assuming that each QTL is associated with at least one SNP   should be at most 0.9  as 100 QTL and 1000 SNPs were simulated. Rearranging gives The variance components  and  were assumed to have independent scaled inverse Chi-square distributions. As shown in (2)  specification of the hyper parameters  and  requires knowing  and . The following describes how  or  were computed based on the known quantities  and . Given independence between SNPs holds and in the absence of selection []: Assuming independence between effects and allele frequencies  this can be written as Rearranging and replacing E() by  gives Also []: Under the same assumptions as made in (5)  in addition to additive effects having mean zero and being independent of dominance effects  this becomes where Substituting this in (8) and rearranging gives Values for  and  can now be calculated by substituting (9) and (6) in (2)  respectively. As shown in [] (with a slightly different notation)  BSAM fits SNP allele states in the following model: where  and   with value (0  1)  are the breed-specific copy numbers of a given allele at SNP  of breed origin  or  that animal  received from its sire or dam  and  and  are the breed-specific substitution effects for the alleles of breed origin  and . The other parameters are defined as in the additive and dominance models. In BSAM  the SNP allele effects have breed-specific variances  and   and breed-specific parameters  and . The same prior as used in the additive model is used for  and . Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling was used to draw inferences from the posterior distributions of parameters. Gibbs sampling was used to sample parameters from their full conditional distributions  which are derived for some key model parameters in Appendix C. Since the implementation of a Gibbs sampler in the additive model has been well described by []  here we focus on the algorithm for the dominance model. The decision to include a SNP in the model was separately sampled for the additive and dominance effects in the dominance model. Similarly  in BSAM  the decision to include a SNP in the model was separately sampled for the sire and dam breed-specific allele substitution effects. The analyses were implemented by modifying [] to allow dominance and allele specific effects. The Markov chain used for inference consisted of 11 000 samples  with the first 1000 discarded as a burn-in. Longer chains did not improve prediction accuracy. Parameters were estimated from the mean of the resulting 10 000 posterior samples. For animal  from breed   the true breeding value is given by where  is the QTL genotype  coded as 0  1  or 2  and  is the true allele substitution effect for QTL   and the GEBV is given by where  is the marker genotype and  is the estimated allele substitution effect for SNP . The definition of  for a purebred animal with a breeding goal of maximizing the performance of the crossbred descendents is described next. Suppose  and  are two alleles at a QTL. Let  denote the frequencies of  in the sire breed and  denote the frequencies of  in the dam breed. The genotypic values (G) of genotypes   and  are 0 <U+2009>+<U+2009> and 2  respectively. The average effect of a  allele from the sire is defined as the expected genotypic value of a crossbred offspring that received  from the sire minus the crossbred population mean. Let  denote the allele that animal  inherited from its sire. Based on the above definition  Similarly  the average effect of a  allele from the sire is . The difference between the two average effects gives the substitution effect for the sire: Similarly  the substitution effect for the dam is <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>2). As a result  the allele substitution effects for a purebred parent used for crossbreeding are breed-specific and defined in terms of the allele frequencies in the breed of the other parent. In summary  for a purebred    in (11) is defined as where ’ is the breed of the other parent of the crossbreds. In BSAM   is directly estimated for prediction of  in (12)  while it is indirectly estimated from the dominance model by combining the estimates of  and  with the current value of  from breed ’ in (13). The additive model does not estimate breed-specific substitution effects. Instead  it estimates a common  for SNP   which uses the allele frequency in the crossbreds used for training. Figure  depicts cumulative responses to GS for the additive  BSAM and dominance models under the four scenarios  when the genome consisted of one chromosome  100 QTL and 1000 SNPs. The cumulative response to selection at generation 20 by the BSAM and the dominance model compared to the additive model is also given in Table . In scenario 1  where the dominance model was most favored  the dominance model had a substantially greater cumulative response than BSAM and the additive model. By generation 20  the dominance model had additional responses of 14.9% over BSAM and of 22.4% over the additive model (<U+2009><<U+2009>10). In scenario 2  however  this advantage was reduced  since the proportion of dominance variance and heterosis decreased from 16.7% and 31% to about 10% for both. As a result  in generation 20  the advantage of the dominance model was reduced from 14.9% to 8.9% for BSAM and from 22.4% to 8.6% for the additive model. However  the differences in the cumulative response at generation 20 between the dominance model and the BSAM and additive model were still significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>10). The advantage of BSAM over the additive model was 6.5% (<U+2009>=<U+2009>9<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) in scenario 1 but this advantage was not significant (=0.84) in scenario 2. In scenario 3  where overdominance was absent  the proportion of  was only 5% and the realized heterosis was 8.4%. In this situation  responses to all three GS models were not significantly different (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.37). In scenario 4  where there was no dominance  the dominance model still had a response as high as the additive model  which was 6.2% greater than the response for BSAM in generation 20 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>4<U+2009>×<U+2009>10).  Cumulative response to GS was computed using the dominance model  BSAM and the additive model in the four scenarios  when there was one chromosome  100 QTL and 1000 SNPs; the plotted cumulative responses are means from 1600 replicates  standardized by the phenotypic standard deviation of crossbreds in generation 0: () results from scenario 1  where  was large with overdominance  () results from scenario 2  where  was realistic with overdominance  () results from scenario 3  where  was realistic without overdominance and () results from scenario 4  where dominance was absent. Figure  shows the results with ten chromosomes  1000 QTL and 10 000 SNPs in the genome. In scenario 1  where the dominance variance and the heterosis were set to be large  the dominance model had a clear advantage over BSAM and the additive model (<U+2009><<U+2009>10). In the other scenarios  the dominance model had either the highest response or a response equal to that of the additive model  whereas BSAM was inferior to the additive model in most situations. Even in scenario 1  with large dominance variance  BSAM had merely a small non-significant advantage (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.16) over the additive model. It can be seen from Table  that with more chromosomes and loci  the advantage of the dominance model over the additive model by generation 20 decreased  except in scenario 3  which had only incomplete dominance. The performance of BSAM was negatively affected by the increase in the number of loci in all scenarios. Although the differences between models became less significant in the simulations with ten chromosomes  the ranking of the models was consistent with those from the simulations with one chromosome.  Cumulative response to GS was computed using the dominance model  BSAM and the additive model in the four scenarios  when there were ten chromosomes  1000 QTL and 10 000 SNPs; the plotted cumulative responses are means from 1600 replicates  standardized by the phenotypic standard deviation of crossbreds in generation 0: () results from scenario 1  where  was large with overdominance  () results from scenario 2  where  was realistic with overdominance  () results from scenario 3  where  was realistic without overdominance and () results from scenario 4  where dominance was absent. From the definition of heterosis  cumulative response to selection in crossbred performance (CR) can be written as where BA denotes the breed average and H the heterosis manifested in the crossbreds. Thus  the observed advantage of the dominance model in some scenarios may be due to greater response in BA or in H  or in both. The relative contributions of BA and H to CR were investigated by partitioning CR into the response in BA and H for each of the 20 generations  and the differences between models were shown by plotting the results of selection on GEBV from one model against those of another model (Figure ). Only results from scenario 1 with a single chromosome were used for illustration. In Figure   the advantage of a model in heterosis was always accompanied by some cost to purebred improvement. The dominance model had a lower response in BA  especially compared to the additive model. However  this lower response was more than compensated by increased heterosis  which resulted in a greater overall CR. By generation 20  the dominance model had a BA that was 0.35 phenotypic standard deviation (sd) lower than that of the additive model. This loss  however  was made up by an advantage of 1.2 phenotypic sd in heterosis  summing up to a total benefit of 0.95 phenotypic sd in CR for the dominance over the additive model (Figure a). In contrast  the advantage of BSAM over the additive model in heterosis was almost cancelled out by a comparable loss in response in BA (Figure c). This explains why BSAM had a limited advantage in CR over the additive model.  Cumulative response for breed average (red crosses) and heterosis in crossbreds (blue dots) was computed from scenario 1  with large  and allowing overdominance  when there was one chromosome  100 QTL and 1000 SNPs; the plotted cumulative responses are means from 1600 replicates  standardized by the phenotypic standard deviation of crossbreds in generation 0: () cumulative response using the dominance model (y-axis) plotted against response using the additive model (x-axis)  () cumulative response using the dominance model against response using BSAM and () cumulative response using BSAM against the additive model; the broken line is y=x. When overdominance is present  crossbred performance is maximized when alternate alleles are fixed in the two pure breeds. Then  all crossbreds will be heterozygous for the over-dominant QTL. Genomic selection had a dramatic effect on heterozygosity of over-dominant QTL in crossbreds (Figure ). In scenario 1  the dominance and BSAM models steadily increased heterozygosity over the 20 generations. However  the rate of increase was smaller for BSAM  for which heterozygosity stabilized to a lower level than for the dominance model after about 12 generations of selection because there was no retraining of the prediction model. With the additive model  heterozygosity increased up to generation 6 and then dropped in subsequent generations.  The plotted values are changes in heterozygosity for over-dominant QTL in crossbreds over generations of selection  under the dominance model  BSAM and the additive model  in scenario 1  with one chromosome and large dominance  averaged over 1600 replicates. Figure  shows the response to selection in allele frequencies of two over-dominant QTL in the two parental breeds  where the plotted values are the means of 100 replicates of the selection process in a given random simulation. The advantage of the dominance model over the additive model had two components. First  the rate of fixation of alternate alleles was faster with the dominance model. Second  the same allele was more often fixed in both parental breeds with the additive model  which is undesirable for over-dominant QTL. The greater efficiency of the dominance model in fixing alternate alleles in the two breeds at over-dominant QTL explains the greater heterosis in Figure a.  The plotted values are changes in allele frequencies of two over-dominant QTL with major dominance effects in the sire and dam breeds over generations of selection  under the additive model and the dominance model  in scenario 1  with one chromosome and large dominance; results are means from 100 replicates in a given random simulation: () shows alternate alleles approaching fixation in the sire and dam breeds more rapidly with the dominance than the additive model and () shows the same allele approaching fixation in both parental breeds with the additive model  in contrast to the dominance model. Including dominance in addition to additive effects in the model was advantageous for response to selection when dominant gene action was present. Even when all gene action was purely additive  using the dominance model did not show a negative effect. However  an advantage of BSAM was observed only when dominance variance and heterosis were large  which confirms our hypothesis that the superiority of BSAM over the additive model may be primarily due to dominance effects  rather than differences in LD between the parental breeds. It has been shown [] that for a two-way cross and ignoring selection  the allele substitution effects for QTL or markers in one parental breed depend on the allele frequencies in the other parental breed. Thus  in the computation of substitution effects  failure to use the appropriate allele frequencies may result in a loss of response to selection. Dekkers [] showed that  with the availability of only purebred data  selection within a breed using QTL allele substitution effects that are based on the allele frequencies from the opposite breed gave substantially greater response to selection than using allele frequencies from the same breed. In the additive model  a single substitution effect was estimated for each SNP  assuming it is the same for both parental breeds. Selection on GEBV derived using such allele substitution effects is expected to fix the favorable allele in both breeds (Figure a). Exceptions to this could be genetic drift or the marker and QTL being in LD with opposite phases in the two parental breeds (Figure b). When the two breeds have opposite LD phases  and a common nonzero substitution effect is estimated for a SNP in the additive model  the allele frequencies of associated QTL will move in opposite directions in the two breeds. In the dominance model  breed-specific allele substitution effects were computed using estimated dominance and additive effects  together with the appropriate allele frequencies from the other parental breed. When overdominance is present  the allele substitution effect <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>2) may have opposite signs in the parental breeds  depending on allele frequencies  in the two breeds []. In this case  the two parental breeds are expected to be fixed for alternate alleles of over-dominant QTL  which increases the frequency of favorable heterozygotes in crossbred progeny. Note that under the additive model  fixation of the favorable allele in both breeds would result in lower heterozygosity in the crossbreds. This explains why the dominance model resulted in substantially greater heterosis than the additive model (Figure a). Recall that the purebred gain was lower with the dominance model than with the additive model because the unfavorable allele was moved towards fixation in one parental breed at some loci. However  the crossbred gain was more than compensated by the larger amount of heterosis in the crossbreds. The dominance model was mostly favored in crossbred gain in scenario 1  where the dominance variance was large (Figure a)  because in this scenario the difference in allele substitution effects between breeds was large. When dominance is incomplete  the breed-specific substitution effects for a locus will have the same sign in both breeds  as can been seen from (13). In the long term  and ignoring drift  the favorable allele will be fixed in both breeds with any GS model. Thus  differences in response to selection in scenario 3 were not significant between GS models (Figure c). However  Kinghorn et al. [] observed that with many QTL  even incomplete dominance had a significant influence on the divergence of allele frequencies in the parental breeds because the effect of drift is not negligible with a large number of loci. This phenomenon was also confirmed in our study  in which the advantage of the dominance model over the additive model in cumulative response to selection increased from 0.2% to 1.0% in the presence of only incomplete dominance (Table   scenario 3)  when the number of loci increased ten-fold. Although the signs of the substitution effects are the same in the parental breeds with incomplete dominance  their magnitude can be very different depending on the allele frequencies. In the additive model  where a common substitution effect is used  loci with negligible substitution effects will be under higher selection pressure than in the dominance model  where breed-specific substitution effects are used. When the number of loci is large  relative to the additive model  the dominance model will put little or no selection pressure on loci with small or negligible substitution effects  resulting in greater genetic progress. Thus  the ability to exploit dominance for loci without overdominance may still be very important. The advantage of the dominance model over the additive model is attributable to the use of breed-specific allele substitution effects to calculate GEBV of purebreds for crossbred performance with the dominance model. Kinghorn et al. [  ] observed an advantage of using breed-specific allele substitution effects for crossbreeding (reciprocal recurrent genomic selection  RRGS) in an ideal situation  where additive and dominance effects at the QTL were known without error. In the presence of overdominance  RRGS had greater cumulative response to selection than the additive model  regardless of whether recalculation of substitution effects of QTL alleles was performed only in the first generation  every five generations or every generation []. In the absence of overdominance  the advantage of RRGS over the additive model was still observed with retraining each generation  especially for many QTL []. In BSAM  for the first generation after training  the estimated breed-specific allele substitution effects of SNPs account for differences in LD and allele frequencies between breeds. However  with repeated selection over generations  the breed-specific allele substitution effects must be re-estimated in BSAM to accommodate changes in allele frequency and LD. Ibáne~z-Escriche et al. [] showed that  when using crossbred data to predict GEBV of purebred descendants  the additive model had a greater accuracy of prediction than BSAM if the breeds were related and the training population size was small relative to the number of markers. However  pure additive inheritance was assumed in their study. Under dominant gene action  we expect BSAM to have an additional advantage over the additive model because  as can be seen from (13)  apart from different LD  breed-specific allele substitution effects will be different when allele frequencies differ between breeds. However  in this study  BSAM had a lower response to selection than the additive model  except when the dominance effects were large and the number of SNPs was not greater than the number of observations. When the number of SNPs was ten times greater than the number of observations  the advantage of BSAM over the additive model was not significant. One reason for the inferior performance of BSAM in most scenarios is model complexity. If a SNP is segregating in both parental breeds  then the SNP will have a nonzero substitution effect in the crossbreds for both breeds. Thus  when most SNPs are segregating in both breeds  we expect BSAM to have about twice the number of nonzero SNP effects in the model as the additive model. As shown in Table   the posterior mean of the number of effects in the additive model was proportional to the magnitude of the dominance variance relative to the additive variance  but this relationship was not observed in BSAM  for which the number of nonzero effects hardly changed between scenarios. In scenario 1  where the dominance variance was about half of the additive variance  many markers were needed in the additive model to jointly pick up the QTL effects. In this case  BSAM was superior to the additive model since only a few additional effects were fitted in the model. In scenario 4  where the size of additive variance was maximum  the number of effects in the additive model was reduced to about the same as the number of QTL  while the number of effects in BSAM was still higher than twice the number of QTL because the allele substitution effects were expected to be nonzero for both breeds. When the number of chromosomes and loci increased ten-fold  the performance of BSAM compared with the additive model became even worse due to the increased model complexity (Table ). Another possible reason to explain the lower response of BSAM relative to the additive model was given by []. Consider a locus that is segregating in breed A but fixed in breed B. Because the additive model regresses phenotypes only on segregating alleles  the common substitution effect for this locus is actually the effect specific to breed A  just as in BSAM. However  BSAM includes an additional substitution effect for breed B  for which the allele is fixed. The substitution effect estimated from BSAM for the breed B allele will only add noise to the prediction of GEBV. Therefore  when several loci are nearly fixed in one of the parental breeds but segregating in the other  the additive model is expected to show an advantage over BSAM. The number of effects in BSAM equals the number of breeds times the number of SNPs. When only two breeds are involved in the cross  the dominance model is expected to have the same number of parameters as BSAM if the number of SNPs included in the model is fixed. However  with separate probability of inclusion parameters  and  for additive and dominance effects  the number of dominance effects that are fitted in the model only depends on the actual number of dominance effects for the trait. As dominance variance was lowered from large to null  the posterior mean of the number of nonzero dominance effects in the model decreased from 58.4 to 4.1 (Table ). Thus  in contrast to BSAM  model complexity does not seem to be an issue for the dominance model. Even when dominance was absent  the response in the dominance model could not be distinguished from that of the additive model (Figure d) because only a few nonzero dominance effects were fitted in the model. In this regard  the dominance model is more robust than BSAM. Even when additive and dominance effects are consistent between breeds  allele substitution effects will be breed-specific if allele frequencies differ between breeds. In such a case  the estimates of breed-specific allele substitution effects in the dominance model are expected to be more accurate than those in BSAM for the following four reasons: First  the estimates of additive and dominance effects from the dominance model are combined with the observed allele frequencies in the opposite parental breed to calculate the breed-specific allele substitution effects. In BSAM  however  breed-specific allele substitution effects are estimated directly. Thus  the allele frequencies used in BSAM are based on the frequencies in the training population of the alleles inherited from the opposite parental breed. Note that the alleles inherited by the training population are a random sample of those from the parental population  and therefore their frequencies will deviate from those of the parental population. Thus  the use of observed allele frequencies from the parental population to compute breed-specific allele substitution effects favors the dominance model over BSAM. Second  in the dominance model  as selection progresses and allele frequencies change due to selection  the observed allele frequencies in each generation are combined with the estimates of additive and dominance effects obtained in training to compute the current values of the breed-specific allele substitution effects. However  with the additive model and with BSAM  the allele substitution effects estimated in training are repeatedly used to compute GEBV of selection candidates  ignoring changes in allele frequencies. As a result  drops in accuracy of GEBV in generations of selection were greater for the additive model and BSAM than for the dominance model (results not shown). Thus  use of the dominance model is expected to require less frequent retraining than use of BSAM or the additive model. This is appealing for traits that are difficult or expensive to measure. Third  under the assumption that additive and dominance effects of QTL are consistent across breeds  as explained below  the goodness of fit to training data is expected to be better for the dominance model than for BSAM. The expected phenotypic value for a given genotype  at a QTL is  In the dominance model given by (3)  these expected values are modeled exactly in terms of  and  as <U+2009>+<U+2009> <U+2009>+<U+2009>   where <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>0 for  <U+2009>=<U+2009>00  <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1 for  <U+2009>=<U+2009>(01 or 10)  or <U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 for  <U+2009>=<U+2009>11. In BSAM  these conditional expectations are modeled as Subtracting (16) from (15) gives As   based on (13)  Comparing this to (14)  where <U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>  implies Thus  deviates  and  cannot both be zero. Similarly  it can be shown that <U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and <U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>2(<U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>1). The nonzero differences between the deviates imply that at least some deviates are not equal to zero. More simply   in the BSAM for  may not be equal to  for   although  is equal to . In other words  the genotypic value is not exactly modeled in BSAM. Forth  implementation of BSAM requires knowing the breed origins of SNP alleles but this is not required for the dominance model. In this study  breed origins of SNP alleles were assumed to be known without error but this may not hold for real data  which would introduce errors to the estimation of breed-specific SNP effects in BSAM. However  the advantages of the dominance model may not hold if additive and dominance effects of SNPs are not consistent between breeds. More precisely  although  and  at the QTL may be consistent between breeds  the SNP effects may differ between breeds due to differences in LD. When these differences of SNP effects between breeds are large  the dominance model may become inferior to BSAM  for which breed-specific allele substitution effects account for differences in LD in addition to differences in allele frequencies. The magnitude and phase of LD  especially long-range LD  has been found to be inconsistent between breeds in livestock [–]. However  whether those differences in LD are large enough to enable BSAM to outperform the dominance model needs further investigation with real data. The benefit of using one model over another depended on the number and size of QTL and the density of SNPs relative to the size of the training population. When the genome was extended from one to ten chromosomes  there was a ten-fold increase in the number of SNPs but the SNP density remained the same. In addition  with the values of variance components held constant  each QTL explained a smaller proportion of the total genetic variance for the larger genome  which made it more difficult to capture the QTL effects through SNPs. This explains the observed reduction of differences in response between models. This suggests that the preference of the dominance model is expected to hold for a larger genome but the amount of benefit will decrease when the genetic architecture is more polygenic. Furthermore  a larger training population will be needed. In this study  SNP effects were estimated only once and applied successively over 20 generations of selection. This is rarely done in practice and retraining is usually carried out after each generation of selection. With retraining  the advantage of the dominance model is expected to be much smaller or may even be ignored because in that case  the additive and BSAM models are also expected to give estimated allele substitution effects using allele frequencies from the current or recent generations. However  if the training population consists of individuals from multiple generations  the estimates of substitution effects in the additive model or BSAM will depend on allele frequencies across multiple generations  which may not be appropriate to predict crossbred performance for the purebred candidates. Although the dominance model was studied here when purebreds were selected for crossbred performance  the advantages of this model over the additive model also apply to selection for purebred performance. Furthermore  the estimates of  and  from the dominance model can be used to predict GEBV in any population with SNP genotypes  provided the LD in the training and candidate populations are about the same. It has been found that the accuracy of GEBV in Holstein-Friesian cattle with training in Jerseys and vice versa was as low as -0.1 to 0.3 over traits []  and the correlations of SNP allele frequencies between Holsteins  Jerseys  and Brown Swiss cattle were as low as 0.65 to 0.67 []. Thus  differences in allele frequencies between breeds  along with dominant gene action  can be attributed to the low accuracy of prediction across breeds in dairy cattle. In this situation  the dominance model is expected to give better results  especially with a high marker density  since then LD would be more consistent between breeds. Besides dominance  other types of non-additive effects may also contribute to heterosis  such as epistasis  imprinting  etc. The dominance model can be further extended to account for imprinting if the heterozygotes are phased. Epistatic interactions between loci are partially included in BSAM as a component of allele substitution effects but will be misspecified in the dominance model  which will impair accuracy of selection. Thus  BSAM may be more robust in the presence of epistasis. When dominance  particularly overdominance  is the key driver of heterosis  using a dominance model for GS is expected to result in greater cumulative response to selection of purebred animals for crossbred performance than either BSAM or the additive model. The extent of this additional response to selection depends on the size of dominance effects at the QTL and the power of detecting the dominance effects through SNP genotypes. Also  when there are many loci  it is important to exploit dominance  even in the absence of overdominance. When BayesC  is used  the dominance model is robust because  even in the absence of dominance  it does not give a lower response than the additive model. BSAM is favored over the additive model only when dominance effects are large enough to overwhelm its shortcomings. Furthermore  implementation of BSAM requires that the breed origins of SNP alleles are known. Our results suggest that in the presence of dominant gene action  relative to BSAM and the additive model  GS with the dominance model is superior to maximize crossbred performance through purebred selection  especially when no retraining is carried out at each generation. Let  and  denote the observed additive and dominance genetic variance of the trait. Assuming no genotype by genotype interactions among QTL that define the trait  the genetic variance components can be written as the sum of the variance explained by each QTL []: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>-<U+2009> is the observed allele frequency for QTL    is the QTL dominance effect  and  is the QTL allele substitution effect defined as where  is the QTL additive effect. Let  and  denote the corresponding desired genetic variance components and  the corresponding scaled QTL effects. Let From (18) and (19)  we have Thus  Similar to  the scalar for dominance effects  we have a scalar  for additive effects such that and Substituting (20) in (21) and rearranging it  we have This can be seen as a quadratic equation with variable  unknown. Thus  the scalar  for the additive effects can be obtained by solving this equation. Since  is already smaller than  for each QTL  to obtain the desirable additive genetic variance   we have a scalar  where Based on (17)  the new substitution effect  for QTL  is simply Thus  the scaled additive and dominance effects are respectively   and . With this approach  the additive genetic variance is the one desired but the dominance genetic variance is not under control. However  as desired  there would be no overdominance affecting the trait. The objective was to test if any difference in cumulative response to GS observed at generation 20 of selection among the additive model  BSAM  and the dominance model is statistically significant. As described  data were collected from 16 simulations each with 100 replicates resulting in a total of 1600 observations. The following mixed linear model was used to fit the data: where  is the response from GS model  in simulation    is the fixed effect for GS model <U+2009>=<U+2009>{1  2  3}   is the random blocking effect for simulation set <U+2009>=<U+2009>{1  …  16}  and  is the residual. A set of t-tests was used for testing the null hypothesis that 1) <U+2009>=<U+2009>  2) <U+2009>=<U+2009>  or 3) <U+2009>=<U+2009>. Let  denote either  or  in the dominance model. The mixture prior for  allows it to be included or not in the model. Let  denote a model inclusion indicator variable defined as with a prior probability 1<U+2009>-<U+2009> that <U+2009>=<U+2009>1. It should be clear that the model allows <U+2009><U+2260><U+2009>. The indicator  and the effect  can be sampled jointly by first sampling  from its marginal distribution and then sampling  conditional on . The posterior “marginal” probability that <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 respecting to  is calculated by where  denotes other parameters besides  and . The “likelihood” in (22) can be obtained by integrating  out from the sampling distribution as described below. Let Then  where  and  are  respectively  the coefficient of the mixed-model equation and the BLUP estimate for . Similarly  let We have where  and . For <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  the “likelihood” is simply where  is either  or  corresponding to  or . Substituting (24-26) in (22) gives the marginal distribution of  respecting to . Given that <U+2009>=<U+2009>1   has a normal prior centered at   otherwise it is zero. Let  denote the other additive effects besides that for SNP   then the full conditional for  is which is a normal  where . The variance variable for the dominance effect depends on the data only through the dominance effects: Thus  due to the conjugacy  the full conditional for  is also a scaled inverse Chi-square  where  and  given the sampled value of . As shown  the prior of  depends on the value of   therefore the full conditional for  is which is a normal . The full conditionals for the other parameters including additive effect for SNP  and its variance variable are as illustrated in [].

In some species  sex chromosomes comprise a large portion of the genome. For example  chromosome Z represents approximately 8% of the chicken genome and therefore is likely to be important in determining genetic variation in a population. When breeding programs make selection decisions based on genomic information  chromosomes that are not represented on the genotyping platform will not be subject to selection. Therefore imputation algorithms should be able to impute genotypes for all chromosomes. The objective of this research was to extend AlphaImpute so that it could impute genotypes on sex chromosomes. The accuracy of imputation was assessed using different genotyping strategies in a real commercial chicken population. The correlation between true and imputed genotypes was high in all the scenarios and was 0.96 for the most favourable scenario. Overall  the accuracy of imputation of the sex chromosome was slightly lower than that of autosomes for all scenarios considered. AlphaImpute [] is a tool for imputing genotypes in pedigreed populations that is flexible to the pedigree structure of genotyped animals and works for large datasets. It involves simple phasing rules  long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation [  ]  and segregation analysis []. It was initially designed to work for autosomes and therefore did not perform imputation of genotypes on sex chromosomes. When genomic information is used to make the selection decisions in breeding programs  chromosomes or other portions of the genome that are not sufficiently represented by the low-density genotyping platforms used to impute high-density genotypes  will be subject to less or no selection emphasis. Therefore  imputation algorithms should be able to impute genotypes for all chromosomes or regions. Ignoring the sex chromosomes in avian species may affect selection decisions  because chromosome Z  unlike sex chromosomes in mammals  is important in poultry due to its relatively long length; it contains more than 730 genes (Chicken genome assembly 2  ENSEMBL release 64) and accounts for approximately 8% of the total physical genome. Chromosome Z is expected to harbor genetic variation relevant to commercial breeding programs and consequently should have selection emphasis placed upon it. The objective of this research was to adapt the imputation algorithm used in AlphaImpute to enable imputation of genotypes for sex chromosomes in birds and mammals. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using genotype data on chromosome Z in a commercial chicken population and this was compared to the imputation of genotypes for autosomal chromosomes in the same population. Chicken data were used in this study. The inheritance of sex chromosomes in the chicken involves the ZW system. Males are ZZ (homogametic) and females are ZW (heterogametic). Males receive one copy of Z from each of their parents  while females receive one copy of Z only from their male parent and none from their female parent. Chromosome Z has a small pseudo-autosomal region that recombines with chromosome W []  which can be treated as an autosomal chromosome in AlphaImpute. AlphaImpute has four primary components: (1) simple phasing rules; (2) long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation; (3) segregation analysis; and (4) simple genotype imputation rules. These have been extensively described in Hickey et al. []. To address the issue of sex chromosome inheritance  some of these components needed to be modified. First  the problem was simplified by artificially doubling the number of gametes carried by the heterogametic gender  so that they were homozygous at all loci for which they were genotyped  which is consistent with standard genotype calling for sex chromosomes by genotyping providers. This also means that heterogametic individuals are phased  for any SNP at which they are genotyped. The simple inheritance based phasing and genotype imputation rules were modified to account for sex chromosome inheritance  i.e. heterogametic individuals inherit alleles only from the homogametic parent  and the alleles inherited from the heterogametic parent are imputed  for any allele the heterogametic parent is genotyped for. For autosomal chromosomes  the long-range phasing component of AlphaImpute uses pedigree information to partition surrogate parents into paternal and maternal groups and also uses simple phasing rules based on pedigree information. However  this partitioning can also be carried out using a pedigree-free approach []  which is suitable for the inheritance of sex chromosomes. The haplotype library phasing and imputation steps are independent of the mode of inheritance and therefore did not need to be modified  other than to ensure that phasing was performed in the pedigree-free mode. For autosomes  AlphaImpute uses GeneProb [] to perform segregation analysis for all markers of all animals in the pedigree. However  GeneProb does not account for sex chromosome inheritance. Therefore  AlphaImpute was modified and the segregation analysis was replaced by a step that processes the pedigree downward and passes the average of the parental alleles to each individual. This implies that alleles not fully imputed have numbers that are similar to allele probabilities and consequently have genotypes that are real numbers between 0 and 2 as opposed to integers  0  1  or 2  where 0 and 2 are homozygotes and 1 is a heterozygote. The implementation is flexible with regards to the gender of the heterogametic individuals and therefore will work for other species such as cattle  sheep  or pigs. When imputing genotypes on sex chromosomes  a file indicating the gender of each individual in the pedigree must be supplied. Performance of the algorithm was assessed using a real chicken dataset from a commercial breeding program  which had a pattern of linkage disequilibrium similar to that described in Andreescu []. High-density genotypes for all 1255 individuals from a pedigree of four generations (Gen1  Gen2  Gen3  Gen4) were available for chromosome Z  and for autosomes 2 and 4. Four alternative genotyping scenarios were generated. In each scenario  164 individuals from 68 half-sib families from the most recent generation were used as the testing set  which correspond to selection candidates whose imputed genotypes would ordinarily be used to calculate their genomic estimate breeding values. The testing set was genotyped using both high-density and low-density genotyping platforms. The high-density platform used was a custom Illumina Infinium array  which consisted of 36 455 SNP of which 1137  3913  and 2211 were segregating SNP located on chromosomes Z  2  and 4  respectively in the datasets studied (Table ). The low-density platform used was the KASPar kbioscience array  which consisted of 384 SNP segregating in the line used in this study. From the 384 SNP of the panel  25  41  and 23 were located on chromosomes Z  2  and 4  respectively. In scenario 1 (SC1) all individuals in generations 1  2  and 3 were genotyped at high-density (i.e. the parents  grand-parents and great grand-parents of the test individuals and a number of other individuals spread across these three generations who were not ancestors of the test individuals) and only the test candidates (generation 4) were genotyped at low-density. Scenario 2 (SC2) was the same as SC1  except that the female ancestors of the test individuals were genotyped at low-density. In scenario 3 (SC3)  all individuals in generation 1 were genotyped at high-density  while all ancestors in generations 2 and 3  and the test candidates were genotyped at low-density. In scenario 4 (SC4)  the algorithm was further evaluated in a larger dataset  consisting of seven generations  where the first three were the same as in SC1 but in the subsequent three generations only the males were genotyped with the high-density panel  while female ancestors and individuals of both sexes in testing generation 7 were genotyped with the low-density panel. Thus  SC4 was an extension of SC2  with more generations separating high-density female ancestors and test individuals. Imputation accuracy was assessed as the correlation between true and imputed genotypes []. Unlike other measures of imputation accuracy  this statistic accounts for the effect of allele frequency on imputation accuracy [] and it allows for the evaluation of markers that are imputed as real numbers between 0 and 2 (i.e. dosage) rather than as genotypes coded as integers (0/1/2) []. AlphaImpute does not impute all markers as integer genotypes but rather supplies genotype probabilities for those that do not have full information for imputation. For example  markers in the region between two informative markers that surround a detected recombination location cannot have their genotypes imputed with certainty. In these regions AlphaImpute first detects a recombination event  then it finds the nearest informative marker on either side of the recombination location. The distance between these two markers is used as a weight to determine the emphasis given to the alleles on each of the parental gametes in the imputed genotype  which results in an imputed genotype that is not an integer. The accuracy of imputation was high for all scenarios and for all chromosomes  although the low-density panel had only a density equivalent to 384 markers across the whole genome (Table )  which is approximately one SNP every 8 to 9 centimorgans. The accuracy of imputation was slightly lower for chromosome Z than for the two autosomes. Both the accuracy and the differences in accuracy between chromosome Z and the two autosomes were affected by the genotyping status of the immediate ancestors of the test individuals. Scenario SC1  which had all ancestors genotyped at high-density  had a higher accuracy of imputation than SC2  which had only male ancestors at high-density and female ancestors at low-density  and than SC3  which had only great-grandparents genotyped at high-density and all other ancestors at low-density. Scenario SC4 was a more extreme case of SC2  in which the test individuals were three additional generations removed from their female ancestors that were genotyped at high-density. Despite this  the accuracy of imputation did not appear to be worse for the autosomes in SC4 compared to SC2  but it was slightly lower in SC4 for chromosome Z (still within the bounds of sampling error due to SC4 having a large sampling variance). The genotyping status of the immediate ancestors of the testing individuals has been shown to be an important factor in determining imputation accuracy for autosomal chromosomes in other species  e.g. [  ]. In this study  this trend was also observed for chromosome Z. The accuracy of imputation on chromosome Z was much more variable across individuals than it was for the two autosomes. With the exception of SC3  for which it was 0.08  the standard deviation of accuracy was at most 0.02 for the autosomes. For chromosome Z  the variability was large and increased with the increasing difficulty of the imputation scenario. For SC3 and SC4  the standard deviations of accuracy were 0.10 and 0.22 respectively. Thus  although the mean accuracy was lower for chromosome Z than for the autosomes  some individuals had high accuracy  while others had low accuracy. The low accuracy in certain individuals for chromosome Z was due to the higher rate of Mendelian errors for chromosome Z in comparison to the autosomes  which in turn may be caused by lower reliability of genotyping platforms for markers on sex chromosomes than for autosomes. AlphaImpute checks for consistency between the genotype information and the pedigree. Individual SNP genotypes are set to missing in both the parent and the offspring if they conflict. This results in removal of SNP that exceed a threshold for the proportion of individuals having that SNP missing from the full imputation involving the use of haplotype information. For autosomes  these SNP are imputed using single-locus segregation analysis [] but for sex chromosomes they are naively imputed as the parent average genotype. For chromosome Z  particularly for SC4  a greater proportion of SNP were excluded from the analysis than for the autosomes (Table ). The good performance of imputation of genotypes on chromosome Z for some individuals can be explained by the fact that imputation of markers on sex chromosomes is less challenging than on autosomes for a number of reasons. Heterogametic individuals are phased   thus avoiding the possibility of phasing errors for these individuals  other than due to genotyping errors. The highly accurate phasing of heterogametic individuals helps in surrogate definition and partitioning in the long-range phasing step  and in the haplotype library phasing step of AlphaImpute for homogametic individuals. Imputation of the gamete received from the heterogametic parent by a homogametic individual is also . Computation time for imputation for all chromosomes was of the order of minutes for this dataset but was faster for chromosome Z than for the autosomes  because the phasing was computationally less demanding and genotype probabilities were not calculated for the reasons aforementioned. Using the imputation approach outlined in this paper  which was specifically designed to impute genotypes on sex chromosomes  did not always outperform the standard autosomal imputation procedure of AlphaImpute. Using the autosomal approach yielded imputation accuracies of 0.97<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04  0.92<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.08  0.84<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.11  and 0.89<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04 for SC1  SC2  SC3  and SC4  respectively. The autosomal approach was better than the specifically designed approach for SC1 but worse for the three remaining scenarios. Good performance of the autosomal approach for imputation of sex chromosomes may be due to the pedigree haplotype library imputation step  which is independent of the mode of inheritance. However  in the presence of highly accurate genotyping of sex chromosome markers and high-density genotypes on close ancestors of the individuals to be imputed  the imputation approach outlined in this paper is expected to be more optimal than the standard autosomal imputation approach implemented in AlphaImpute. The pseudo-autosomal region of chromosome Z and chromosome W was ignored in this study due to the difficulty in both identifying and sequencing SNP in this region. If these can be reliably identified  they can be treated as an artificial autosomal chromosome in AlphaImpute. Compared to chromosome Z  chromosome W is very small  contains only a handful of known genes [] and has very few known SNP reported in Assembly 2 of the chicken genome. AlphaImpute was modified to impute genotypes on sex chromosomes. The high accuracy of imputation for chromosome Z obtained in this study  coupled with the previously obtained high accuracy of imputation for autosomes  makes routine implementation of low-cost genomic selection in chickens possible for most of the genome.

In chicken  the GC content of 5 UTR is significantly and positively correlated with expression level  expression breadth  and maximum expression level  whereas that of coding sequences and introns and at the third coding position are negatively correlated with expression level and expression breadth  and not correlated with maximum expression level. These significant trends are independent of recombination rate  chromosome size and gene density. Furthermore  multiple linear regression analysis indicated that GC content in genes could explain approximately 10% of the variation in gene expression. GC content is significantly associated with gene expression pattern and could be one of the important regulation factors in the chicken genome. GC content varies greatly between different genomic regions in many eukaryotes. A striking characteristic of vertebrate genomes  such as mammals and birds  is that their GC content varies over hundreds of kilobases to megabases constituting the so-called “isochore structure”[–]. It is generally recognized that this highly heterogeneous GC content distribution is a fundamental level of genome organization. Many studies have demonstrated that GC content is associated with various genomic features. For example  gene density  recombination rate  distribution of repetitive elements i.e. short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) such as Alu repeats in primates  long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) and other transposons and retrotransposons are significantly associated with GC content[–]. In order to investigate whether the isochore structure of a genome influences gene expression patterns  several studies have analyzed the relationship between GC content and gene expression in man and mouse. Lercher et al.[] reported that gene expression breadth and GC content were strongly correlated and suggested that the concentration of housekeeping genes in GC-rich isochores might be the result of selective pressure. In a study on the human genome  Vinogradov[] showed that a correlation existed between the GC content in genes and the maximum level of gene expression among tissues but that the promoter CpG island and gene CpG levels were more strongly related to expression breadth  which suggests that the variations of GC content and CpG level could determine the characteristics of gene expression in a synergistic interplay with transcription-factor-binding sites. The positive correlation between gene expression level and GC content of coding DNA sequences (CDS)  5 UTR and 3 UTR sequences and at the third positions in codons (GC) has also been reported in mouse[]. However  Gonçalves et al.[] argued that  in mammalian genomes  the CDS of ubiquitously expressed genes generally have a low GC content and are often associated with retropseudogenes. Based on different measures of gene expression (EST  SAGE and microarray) and GC content in human and mouse genomes  Sémon et al.[] showed that the correlations (either positive or negative) between GC content and gene expression were very weak. Although these correlations were statistically significant  the authors indicated that they should be further validated and interpreted with caution. However  more recently Arhondakis et al.[  ] reported a relatively high correlation between GC content and gene expression in man and mouse. To date  this question is still a matter for debate. The origins of mammals and birds can be traced back to a common ancestral species  300–350 million years ago[]. Among the avian species  chicken () is the best studied representative with a complete genome sequence. The distinctive features and organization of its sequence make it a good model to explore important issues in genome structure and evolution. Our aim is to investigate whether the highly heterogeneous distribution of GC content along the chicken genome does significantly influence the pattern of gene expression. To date  no systematic examination of the impact of GC content on the pattern of gene expression in chicken has been performed. In this study  we analyzed the correlation between GC content and gene expression for the whole chicken genome. Our data demonstrate that the GC content of 5 UTR is positively and significantly correlated with gene expression level  gene expression breadth  and maximum gene expression level  whereas the GC contents of CDS  introns and GC are negatively correlated with gene expression level and breadth. In this study  only nuclear genes with complete information on protein-coding sequence and with no evidence of multiple-splicing forms were included. Gene sequences were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq database (). Coding DNA sequences (CDS)  complete mRNA sequences (or full length cDNA sequences)  and 5 UTR sequences corresponding to all annotated genes in the chicken genome were downloaded from Ensembl. For genes with a single splicing isoform  CDS length should be equal to the total length of all exons. Thus  we discarded all sequences showing a length difference of at least one base. Genes with a CDS that did not begin with an ATG start codon  or did not have a length<U+2009>><U+2009>300 bp  or did not occur in multiples of three nucleotides  or contained an internal stop codon  were also discarded. The 5 UTR of a gene is often the least well-defined region. In this 5 UTR data collection  only genes with known protein products (rather than with novel or predicted transcripts) were included  which ensured that the 5 and 3 ends of the analyzed 5 UTR sequences were experimentally supported. Another potential risk is that 5 UTR sequences may be subject to annotation errors. In order to circumvent this problem  we retrieved the full length of cDNA sequences (or the complete mRNA sequences) corresponding to the above correctly annotated genes  then aligned the complete CDS to cDNA sequences by BLAT. 5 UTR that were not consistent with the alignment results were excluded. For each gene  the GC contents of the CDS  introns  and 5 UTR were determined. The GC were calculated by codonW 1.4.2. Chicken expression data taken from a previous study[] included data for 19 tissues i.e. blood  brain  bursa of fabricius  cecum  connective tissue  embryonic tissue  epiphyseal growth plate  gonad  head  heart  limb  liver  muscle  ovary  pancreas  spleen  testis  and thymus. Three indices i.e. expression level  expression breadth and maximum expression level were used to measure the expression pattern of a given gene. For a given gene  expression level is the number of EST counts in all tissues  expression breadth is the number of tissues in which EST are found and maximum expression level is the highest expression value observed among the 19 tissues. CpG islands were identified using hgTables of the UCSC Genome Browser (). The following criteria were used: GC content<U+2009>=<U+2009>55%  Obs/Exp<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65  and length<U+2009>=<U+2009>500 bp[  ]. Our analysis focused on the CpG islands of the 5 regions of the genes selected  and more specifically of the promoter regions. Although giving a precise definition of the promoter region of a gene is an unsolved issue  in most cases it is a short region (e.g.  200 bp) located immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS)[  ]. Furthermore  since in eukaryotes the average length of 5 UTR is about 100–200 bp[  ]  we retrieved a 2 kb long sequence immediately upstream of the first coding site for each gene and if it contained a CpG island  this gene was regarded as CpG island-positive. The recombination rates for 1 Mb windows were estimated using the NCBI build 2.1 (released November  2006) of the chicken genome assembly and the latest chicken consensus linkage map (sex-averaged map)[]. The location of individual markers was determined based on the alignment of the full marker sequence using BLAST. For each 1 Mb sliding window  a linear function was fit to the points representing genetic and physical map positions and the slope of this line was interpreted as an estimation of the recombination rate. For further details see[]. Correlation analysis between variables was performed by SAS Proprietary Software Release 8.1. In order to assess the actual strength of associations  correlation coefficients reported in this study were obtained using all genes independently  instead of subdividing genes into groups and then investigating the relationships among them. The significance tests were corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni step-down correction[]. To determine the variables contributing to expression patterns and how they may interact  we performed multiple linear regressions with the variables  excluding those not contributing significantly through the use of the t-statistical logarithm with backward stepwise regression. The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Protection Committee of South China Agricultural University. In order to accurately estimate the GC content of gene compartments  only nuclear genes with complete information on protein-coding sequence and with no evidence of multiple-splicing forms were included. The sequence collection contained 8631 CDS  each corresponding to a unique gene in the  genome. The 5 UTR sequences dataset included only the genes with known protein products (see Methods). A recent study in man and mouse demonstrated that the 5 UTR of approximately 50% of genes contain an upstream open reading frame (uORF)  suggesting that uORF are phylogenetically widespread regulatory elements in the 5 UTR of eukaryotic genes[]. Since a considerable fraction of the 5 UTR contain an uORF at least 10 codons long[]  we considered only entries with complete 5 UTR sequences spanning from the cap site to the start codon (excluded) with a length<U+2009>=<U+2009>30 bp representing 3575 genes. We calculated the GC content of the CDS  introns  and 5 UTR for each gene. The average GC contents of CDS  introns  and 5 UTR are 49.78<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.04%  42.54<U+2009>±<U+2009>7.31%  and 65.08<U+2009>±<U+2009>14.65%  respectively. Our results show that the GC content of 5 UTR is significantly higher than that of CDS and introns (significance tested using 1-way analysis of variance). As shown in Table   the GC content of 5 UTR is significantly and positively correlated with expression level  expression breadth  and maximum expression level  whereas that of CDS and introns  and GC are negatively correlated with expression level and expression breadth  and are not correlated with maximum expression level. To determine which variables contributed to the differences in gene expression pattern and how they may interact  we performed multiple linear regressions with the above variables  excluding those not contributing significantly through the use of the t-statistical analysis and with backward stepwise regression. The best combinations of variables were the GC content of 5 UTR and GC (expression level  R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0846  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001; expression breadth  R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1031  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Stepwise selection model analysis indicated that the GC content of 5 UTR is the major factor responsible for variance in gene expression pattern (expression level  R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0542  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001; expression breadth  R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0684  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). GC content varies greatly between different genomic regions in chicken. This trend has been partly attributed to the recombination heterogeneity  since the mutagenic effects of recombination could result in a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions with high recombination rates (GC-biased gene conversion). Recently  Rao et al.[] compared the GC content of CDS and introns between regions with the highest recombination rate and those of null recombination in chicken and showed that the GC contents of CDS and introns in the top recombination regions are significantly greater than that of the regions without recombination. Therefore  a question that should be addressed is whether the pattern between GC content and expression is independent of the recombination process. In order to test this hypothesis  we estimated the recombination rate in 1 Mb windows across the chicken genome and computed the average gene expression level and expression breadth for each non-overlapping window. No significant correlation was detected between recombination rate and gene expression (expression level  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0061  P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6073; expression breadth  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0166  P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1453). In most avian species  the karyotype contains both macro-chromosomes and micro-chromosomes unlike that of mammals. The chicken karyotype (2n<U+2009>=<U+2009>78) is made up of 39 pairs of chromosomes  which are divided into five pairs of macro-chromosomes (GGA1–5)  five pairs of intermediate chromosomes (GGA6–10) and 28 pairs of micro-chromosomes (GGA11–38) along with one pair of sex chromosomes (ZW female  ZZ male). Micro-chromosomes display a high recombination rate  high gene density and high GC content  which clearly distinguish them from macro-chromosomes[]. Furthermore  it has been shown that the distribution of GC content in macro-chromosomes is narrow while  in micro-chromosomes  it is broader and shifts to higher values[]. In order to test whether the impact of GC content on gene expression pattern differs or not among the three chicken chromosome groups  regression analyses between GC content and gene expression in each of the three groups were performed. Table  shows that the GC content of 5 UTR was positively correlated with gene expression level  expression breadth  and maximum expression level for the three groups. The GC contents of CDS  introns  and GC were negatively and significantly correlated with expression level  expression breadth and maximum expression level for the intermediate-sized chromosomes and micro-chromosomes. For the macro-chromosomes  a similar trend was observed but with a slightly lower coefficient except for maximum expression level. Since the gene density (number of genes per Mb) of macro-chromosomes was significantly lower than that of micro-chromosomes[]  we assume that this explains the slight difference observed between macro-chromosomes and micro-chromosomes. However  gene density did not show any significant correlation with expression level and expression breadth (expression level  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0194  P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.4466; expression breadth  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0622  P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3828). Based on the hgTables of the UCSC Genome Browser ()  we analyzed CpG islands in the 5 region of these genes  and more specifically in the promoter regions. Among the 8631 genes analyzed  4393 contained at least one CpG island in the 2 kb region upstream of the first coding site. Among these 4393 genes  3699 overlapped with a TSS. Of the 292 ubiquitously expressed genes (expression breadth<U+2009>=<U+2009>15)  232 contained CpG islands  and 30 genes had CpG islands that did not overlap with a TSS. The average size of the CpG islands was 934 bp. Of the 2743 tissue-specific genes (expression breadth<U+2009>=<U+2009>3)  1016 contained CpG islands  and 282 genes has CpG islands that did not overlap with a TSS. In this case  the average size of the CpG islands was 912 bp. Figure  shows the ratio of genes containing CpG islands and the ratio of genes containing CpG islands overlapping with a TSS within the 5 region of genes according to different values of expression breadth. Regression analysis indicated that the ratio of genes containing CpG islands was significantly and positively correlated with expression breadth with a very high coefficient (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9342  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). The ratio of genes containing CpG islands overlapping with a TSS was also highly correlated with expression breadth (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9114  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001).  CpG islands were identified using hgTables of the UCSC Genome Browser (); the following search criteria were used: GC content<U+2009>=<U+2009>55%  Obs/Exp<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.65  and length<U+2009>=<U+2009>500 bp; the ratio of genes containing CpG islands is significantly and positively correlated with expression breadth at a very high coefficient (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9342  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001); the ratio of genes containing CpG islands overlapping with TSS is also highly correlated with expression breadth (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9114  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). In order to investigate whether the heterogeneous distribution of GC content along the genome has any significant impact on gene expression pattern in chicken  we carried out a genome scale analysis of the relationship between GC content and expression. Our data demonstrated that the GC content of the 5 UTR was positively correlated with expression level  expression breadth  and maximum expression level  whereas  the GC contents of CDS  introns  and GC were negatively correlated with expression level and expression breadth. These significant trends are independent of recombination rate  chromosome size and gene density. Furthermore  multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the GC content could explain approximately 10% of the variation in gene expression. The best combinations of variables were GC content in 5 UTR and GC. Stepwise selection model analysis indicated that the GC content in 5 UTR is the major factor responsible for the variance in gene expression pattern. Our study clearly demonstrated that the nucleotide composition of a gene is significantly associated with gene expression pattern and could be an important regulation factor in chicken. The positive trend between GC content in 5 UTR and expression could be due to the C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>T mutation bias of that has been selectively hampered by depletion of methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides from the CpG islands in the 5 regions of genes. Indeed  it is well known that  in vertebrates  most CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the carbon 5-position of the cytosine residue except for the CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands  and a 5-methylcytosine is more likely to be deaminated to produce a thymine (C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>T mutation bias)[  ]. Recently  Li et al.[] constructed a genome-wide chicken DNA methylation map. They found that DNA methylation is enriched in the gene body regions and the repetitive sequences  and depleted in transcription start and transcription termination sites. In our study  we also found that the GC content of 5 UTR is significantly higher than that of CDS and introns (significance tested using 1-way analysis of variance). Similar to previous studies[      ]  our data indicate that CpG islands typically occur at the TSS of genes  in particular for ubiquitously expressed genes. Furthermore  regression analysis showed that the ratio of genes containing CpG islands overlapping a TSS was significantly and positively associated with expression breadth at a very high coefficient. This implies that a gene containing CpG islands overlapping a TSS tends to be expressed in many tissues in chicken. Since expression level and expression breadth are highly correlated in this dataset (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8348  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  the same biased mutational process discussed above could explain the significant trend between GC content in 5 UTR and gene expression level in chicken. Since 5 UTR regions are known to play crucial roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression[]  the nucleotide composition of these regions may evolve partly in response to selective pressures depending on their function. There is no clear explanation for the negative correlation between gene expression and GC content in CDS  introns and GC. A weak negative correlation between GC content in CDS and expression breadth has also been reported in man by Gonçalves et al.[]. They compared the structure and expression of genes with or without known retropseudogenes  and found that genes with retropseudogenes show significantly poorer GC levels than genes without known retropseudogenes  suggesting that GC-poor mRNA have a higher efficiency of reverse-transcription through LINE reverse-transcriptase compared with GC-rich mRNA. Since retrotranscribed genes are predominantly ubiquitously expressed genes involved in metabolism or in protein and RNA synthesis in human  the negative correlation between GC level and expression breadth can be partially explained. However  this is not the case in the chicken genome. Although the chicken genome hosts its own LINE-like elements  the reverse transcriptase encoded by these elements is unlikely to copy polyadenylated mRNA since the density of LINEs and the activity of transposable elements are very low. Recently  Rao et al.[] carried out a systematic examination of the codon usage in chicken. They found that codon bias is negatively correlated with GC  GC content in CDS  and GC content in intronic sequences with a high coefficient. Combined with the results of this study  we conclude that a gene with a lower GC content in CDS  introns  or GC tends to be highly and broadly expressed among tissues with stronger codon bias in chicken. This negative trend may be explained partially by selection of these genes to translate more efficiently and accurately in the chicken genome. GC content in genes is significantly associated with gene expression pattern and could be one of the important regulation factors in the chicken genome.

Modelling growth in IPN survivors as a mixture trait improved the predictive ability of the model compared with a classical linear model. The results indicated considerable genetic variation in health status among survivors. Mixture modelling may be useful for the genetic analysis of diseases detected mainly through indicator traits. Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a viral disease affecting salmonid fishes. Survival after exposure to IPN virus is highly heritable in Atlantic salmon [–]  where the majority of genetic variation is controlled by a single major QTL [  ]. Under field conditions  infection with IPN virus not only causes mortality  but also poor growth of some of the affected survivors  so-called “IPN runts” [  ]. In field data  the true health status of surviving fish is usually unknown  thus the growth of fish in a population containing IPN runts can be considered as a variable drawn from a mixture distribution with (at least) two sub-distributions. Each sub-distribution represents different health classes (e.g.  healthy fish and IPN runts). Finite mixture models are useful in situations where an underlying group structure exists (e.g.  unknown health status of fish) in the data []  and can be used to obtain information on individual health status based only on observed growth (and potentially other indicator traits). Previously  mixture models have been used to analyse milk somatic cell count data [–] and better understand subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. Using the model described by Ødegård et al. []  the health status of fish may be considered as an unobserved binary variable affecting the distribution of growth data in Atlantic salmon exposed to IPN. Probability of these hidden binary classes can be modeled through a liability-normal mixture model. Thus  data on growth can contribute to breeding values for health  even in the absence of direct recording of the disease (given that the fish have been exposed to infection). Furthermore  since the growth of IPN runts does not reflect their true growth potential in a disease-free environment  the mixture model can be used to predict more reliable breeding values for growth potential  even based on data from disease-exposed environments. The main objective of this study was to apply a mixture model to two traits  i.e. growth and sexual maturation  the latter being a binary trait (sexual maturation). A secondary objective was to estimate genetic parameters for health and correlated traits from surviving fish after a natural outbreak of IPN in a commercial production environment of Atlantic salmon. Phenotypic data on survival  growth  sex and sexual maturation of Atlantic salmon were obtained from the 2002 year-class of the Salmobreed population. Fish were the offspring from a hierarchical mating design in which one sire was mated with two dams and each dam to one sire only. The pedigree used for the genetic analyses consisted of the recorded fish and their parents (152 sires and 294 dams)  the latter coming from a non-pedigreed farmed salmon population. The tagged individuals were random samples from each family among the individuals that had reached tagging size. Families were kept separate until tagging before all tagged individuals were transferred to a single sea cage. The fish (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>14 931 with average tagging weight of 31.8 g (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.1 g)  tagged in October-November 2002) in this year-class suffered very high mortalities (72%) due to a natural outbreak of IPN during the first summer at sea. Since dead fish were not individually tested for IPN  a fraction (probably quite small) of the mortality may have had other causes. The surviving fish were slaughtered or selected as breeders during three different periods between March 21 and August 24  2005. The number of fish from each sex-maturation class and their average weights at the different harvesting times are summarized in Table   which shows that harvesting time was not random (a result of practical considerations within the breeding nucleus). Growth potential was assessed by growth rate (GR)  calculated as: GR<U+2009>=<U+2009>(harvest weight (g) – tagging weight (g))/days between tagging and harvest  probably a more robust measure than the crude weight of the fish. Furthermore  the sex (male/female) and sexual maturation status (maturing<U+2009>=<U+2009>1/not maturing<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) of each fish were recorded  based on external characteristics. Growth rates of fish of unknown sex (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>5) and fish with external characteristics indicating that they had reached sexual maturity the year before  defined as early sexual mature (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>232)  were not included in the statistical analysis of growth  but these fish were included as survivors (for the analyses including survival). This resulted in 3959 growth and 14 931 survival (dead<U+2009>=<U+2009>0/alive<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) records. This data has not been used in previous publications. A preliminary analysis of growth (results not shown) using standard linear models indicated a non-significant effect common to full-sibs (e.g.  due to separate rearing of each full-sib family until tagging)  in addition to additive genetics  and this effect was thus not included in the final statistical models. In the mixture models described here  observations in the data vector  (growth data) are assumed to come from two overlapping distributions (mixture components); one distribution for growth of healthy animals  and one distribution for growth of infected animals (runts). The two mixture components are assumed to have different means (runts are assumed to have a lower mean)  and potentially different variances. The sub-distribution to which each observation belongs and parameters of the two sub-distributions are assumed unknown  i.e.  health status of animals is assumed unknown and must be inferred from the observed growth data. Following the notation in Ødegård et al. []  putative health statuses of all fish are included in a vector   which has one element for each growth observation in the dataset. If observation  is assumed to come from a healthy animal  the corresponding element in   <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  otherwise <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. Furthermore  we define a diagonal matrix <U+2009>=<U+2009>diag(). The fully conditional densities of the individual mixture variables are proportional to independent binary distributions with a success (healthy) probability: where p(|model <U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1) is the likelihood of the observation (under the current model parameters)  given that the animal is healthy  while p(|model <U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>0) is the corresponding likelihood  given that the animal is diseased. Finally  Pr(<U+2009>=<U+2009>1|model) is the prior probability of being healthy  given the model  and Pr(<U+2009>=<U+2009>0|model)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>-<U+2009>Pr(<U+2009>=<U+2009>1|model). Five statistical models were used to analyze the data. Model 1 was a classical linear (non-mixture) animal model for genetic analysis of growth in salmon  while Models 2–5 were mixture animal models of varying complexity and considering different traits. where  is a vector of observed growth rates   is a vector including fixed effects of sex by sexual maturation;   with  being a vector of additive genetic effects of growth for all animals and  is the numerator relationship matrix    with  being a vector of random residuals; where  is an identity matrix of dimension  (number of animals with growth-data); and the  and  matrices are appropriate incidence matrices. where  is a vector of unobserved liabilities associated with the mixture variable vector  i.e. the diagonal elements of   also unobserved; if an element of this vector takes the value <U+2009>=<U+2009>1  this implies that the associated liability <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  while <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 implies that <U+2009><<U+2009>0 (as in a standard probit threshold model). The factor  is now a vector including the fixed sex- and maturation-specific means for growth rate of runts;  is a vector of fixed effects means for growth rates of healthy animals  as deviations from the mean growth rate of runts  nested within three categories: maturing fish  non-maturing males and non-maturing females (distinguishing health effects of males and females within maturing fish caused estimation problems  since practically no maturing females were classified as runts);  is a design matrix that assigns records to these three sex-maturation class categories;  is the overall mean of liabilities associated with health status;  is a vector of ones; where  is the residual variance of growth for healthy animals  while  is the residual variance of growth in runts. Other factors are as in model 1. In model 2  growth potential was assumed to be expressed in healthy animals only. where  is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix of growth and health status liability and  is the Kronecker product of  and the additive relationship matrix . Analysis of the results of the models described above  and of the plots of the observed growth phenotypes for the different sex by maturation classes  showed that the frequency of runts differed among classes. Based on visual plots and outputs from the models  it was clear that the number of runts was lower among sexually maturing fish. This may be due to delayed sexual maturation in fish that had undergone infection (potentially as a result of retarded growth and reduced body reserves). Furthermore  sexual maturation itself also affects growth (fish that begin to mature are probably under hormonal stimulation of growth). Thus  in the models described above  there may be a confounding effect between health status and sexual maturation on growth. For this reason  a third model was developed  in which health status was also assumed to affect the liability for sexual maturation. Thus  a healthy fish was assumed to have both increased liability for sexual maturation and increased growth  compared with a runt. This was modeled by including a third model with sexual maturation as the dependent variable. The sub-model for sexual maturation may be considered as a probit of mixtures []  and the full model may be written as: where  is a vector of unobserved liabilities associated with the observed sexual maturation status (non-maturing<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  maturing =1) vector ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 implies that <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 implies that <U+2009><<U+2009>0  as in a standard probit threshold model;  includes the fixed effects of sex on the liability for sexual maturation  while  includes fixed sex-specific effects of health status on liability for sexual maturation    where  is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix of growth  liability to be healthy and liability to sexual maturation. Furthermore  the residuals were assumed distributed as: The fully conditional probability of the individual mixture variable <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 is now: Here  p( <U+2009>|model <U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1) is the joint likelihood of growth and the current sample of the liability for sexual maturation  given that the animal is healthy  while p( <U+2009>|model <U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>0) is the corresponding liability given that the animal is infected. Due to the fact that most fish died prior to weight recording  and mortality was mainly due to IPN  for which resistance is highly heritable  the survivors may be viewed as a selected sample  and hence a multivariate model including survival would be appropriate: where  is a vector of liabilities associated with observed survival (vector ); <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 implies that <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  and s<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 implies that <U+2009><<U+2009>0  as in a standard probit threshold model;  includes the overall mean for the underlying liability to survival; where  is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix of growth  liability to be healthy  liability for sexual maturation  and liability for survival; where  is an identity matrix of dimension  (number of animals with survival data)  and the other parameters are as defined above. Although survival was recorded on all fish  the other traits (i.e.  growth rate  sexual maturation and health status) could only be recorded (or inferred) on survivors. For this reason  residual covariances between survival and the other traits were not estimable and were thus restricted to be zero. This model investigated the presence of genetic effects on growth in runts  assuming that growth in healthy fish and growth in runts are potentially distinct genetic traits by distinguishing between a common genetic effect for growth expressed in all fish and a growth effect only expressed in healthy animals. The model was: Now  where  is the basic additive genetic effects on growth for all fish (runts and healthy)   is now the additional additive genetic effect on growth for healthy fish   is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix of basic growth  additional growth in healthy fish  liability to be healthy  liability for sexual maturation  and liability for survival. Other parameters were defined above. Thus  this model included a new genetic effect  later referred to as ‘runt growth’  with an additive genetic variance equal to the variance in   which represents the growth potential given that an animal is a runt and can be seen as a measurement of the severity of the symptoms of infection. All models were analyzed using the Gibbs sampling module (RJMC) of the DMU software package []. Genetic (co)variance components were sampled using an algorithm allowing the proper estimation of additive genetic (co)variance components for cross-sectional animal threshold models []  i.e.  based only on the additive genetic effects sampled for the parents  rather than for all animals in the pedigree. In general  conditional on   all models are reduced to standard multivariate models for binary and normally distributed traits. We used the standard prior distributions for all traits (i.e.  growth and the underlying liability traits were all assumed to be Gaussian)  liability traits had a residual variance equal to 1. The threshold value was assumed to be zero  implying that binary categories of 0 and 1 corresponded to positive and negative liabilities  respectively. In the following  <U+2009>=<U+2009>[   ]   is a vector of all observations (Gaussian and binary)   is a vector of the binary observations only  and  is a vector of the liabilities associated with all binary traits. The increased joint posterior density of all unknowns is then: The probability Pr(|) ensures that the standard assumptions for threshold models are fulfilled  i.e.  that 0/1 observations correspond to negative/positive liabilities  respectively. Furthermore  in the most complex models (Models 4 and 5): The latter is true due to the fact that all traits are assumed conditionally independent (due to the structure of . Furthermore  conditioning on  is not relevant for   as the model for this trait does not include . The probability Pr(|) is equivalent to the standard assumption for threshold models  ensuring that values of  and the sign of the corresponding liabilities are in concordance. Finally  p() <U+2009>=<U+2009> p(|)p()p()p()  which follows standard assumptions  as described in the model descriptions; p(|) being multivariate normal  and p()  p() and p() were all assigned bounded uniform priors. Additionally   was restricted to be diagonal with unity diagonal elements for all liability traits  as described above. Conditional on   and the restrictions mentioned above  all parameters were sampled from their full conditional densities  as in a standard multivariate linear-threshold model. The elements of  were sampled from the full conditional Bernoulli distributions  as described in the model section. All models were run for 20 000 rounds of burn-in  and thereafter for 2000 000 rounds; results were stored after every 100 rounds. Convergence of the Markov chains was confirmed by visual inspection of trace plots and by Raftery and Lewis convergence diagnostics []. All models converged in less than 2000 000 rounds  according to the diagnostics  but  for convenience  the same length was used for all models  and long chains were used to avoid the need to extend the chain for any of the models later. The correlation between the estimated breeding values of the survivors for growth rate and health status  respectively  obtained from the different models was used as a measure of the similarities or differences of the models for predicting the genetic merit of these traits. The ability of predicting growth was compared for the different models through predictive cross-validation using predictive log-scores of the models []  approximated by evaluating the models based on posterior mean parameter estimates. Specifically  growth data were separated into where  is the data used to estimate model parameters (posterior means)  and  includes the data points (growth phenotypes) to be predicted. Posterior mean predictive log-score (PMPLS) for Model  was then calculated as: where  is a vector of posterior means for all model parameters for model . For Model 1 ()   is the probability density function of observation  in   assuming a standard Gaussian model and the parameters estimated with this model. For Model 2 (): where   and  is the expected liability of being healthy for observation   given the associated parameters in . A low PMPLS indicates a better predictive ability  and models with the lowest possible PMPLS are therefore favored. A randomly chosen subset consisting of 10% of the observations was included in   and parameters were estimated based on the remaining 90% of the observations in . Five different sets of  and  were extracted by removing a random set of 10% of the growth records and used to estimate the predictive ability of the models. Figure  shows the frequency distribution of growth rates for animals in each of the four categories of sex and sexual maturation. Generally  the growth rate of the fish was lower than usually recorded during the periods without IPN-infections (results not shown). At the time of recording  2.5 to 3 years after tagging  only 20% of the males and 40% of the females were maturing. The categories differed in average growth as well as in the distributions of growth. Both maturing and non-maturing males had skewed distributions resembling mixtures. The same applied to non-maturing females  while the growth distribution of maturing females was close to a normal distribution. The Jarque-Bera test [] indicated that all four distributions in Figure  deviated from the normal distribution (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  with p-values ranging from 0.031 (maturing males) to less than 0.001 (non-maturing females)  i.e.  the maturing males and non-maturing females were less and most deviant from a normal distribution  respectively. This may indicate a low incidence of runts among maturing females and a high incidence of runts in non-maturing females.                                                      The estimated proportions of healthy fish within each systematic effect category (Table ) confirmed several of the differences that were observed from visual inspection of the growth distributions shown in Figure . Maturing females  which seemed to have a growth distribution most closely resembling a normal distribution  led to very high proportions of healthy fish in all models (ranging from 0.99-1.00). Non-maturing females showed the lowest proportion of healthy fish  which could explain their skewed phenotypic growth distribution. Also in males  the non-maturing group had the lowest proportion of healthy fish  but with a smaller difference between maturing and non-maturing groups than in females. Model 2  in which health status and sexual maturation were assumed to be independent effects  estimated a much lower infection-rate (6%) than the models that assumed that infection also affected liability for sexual maturation (15% in Models 3 and 4). Finally  the model that assumed the existence of a genetic component for growth in runts (Model 5) gave an even higher estimated occurrence of runts (19%). The expected growth rates within each fixed effect category  estimated by the different models  are presented in Figure . For runts  expected growth was estimated as the effect of sex-maturation class. For healthy fish  expected growth was estimated as the sum of the estimated effect of sex-maturation class and the effect of being healthy  nested within that sex-maturation class. It should be noted that the effect of being healthy was estimated jointly for maturing males and females. This was due to the near absence of runts within maturing females  causing the expected growth of maturing female runts to be interpreted from the corresponding difference in growth between runt and healthy maturing males. The figure shows that growth rates differ substantially between maturing and non-maturing animals  and also that the health status has a strong impact on growth rate  especially in maturing animals. There were no significant differences between the models with respect to estimates of the systematic effects.  (1) Classic animal model for growth; (2) Bivariate model including growth and liability of being healthy; (3) Extension of (2) where sexual maturation is included as a third trait; (4) An extension of (3) to also include a survival-model with genetic effects; (5) An extension of (4) to include a genetic effect of growth in runts as well as in healthy animals. Model (1) did not distinguish between healthy animals and runts  but its fixed effects were compared to the fixed effects obtained for healthy animals with the other models  as most animals belonged to that category  and it is common  when health is not recorded  to assume that recorded animals are healthy. The estimated heritabilities for the different models are reported in Table . The estimated heritability of growth  both in healthy fish and (when included) in runts  was consistently of medium magnitude and on average equal to 0.29 for all models. The estimated heritability for liability for health status varied between models  but was always significantly positive (0.36-0.68). Heritability of observed survival was close to 0.5  with a rather low standard error (Models 4 and 5). Finally  the estimated heritability for liability for sexual maturation was around 0.3 for all models that included this trait in the analysis. Estimated genetic correlations between the traits are reported in Table . The different models generally agreed on the estimated genetic correlations  but large posterior standard deviations of the sampled correlations makes it difficult to compare them across models. The genetic correlation between growth of healthy fish and liability for health status tended to be positive. However  the estimated genetic correlation between liability to be healthy and growth of runts (when included) was close to zero. Survival tended to have low to moderate favorable genetic correlations with the other traits  while there was a tendency towards weak to moderately unfavorable genetic correlations between sexual maturation and health. Table  shows that high correlations were observed between breeding values obtained with models that included the same traits (i.e. between model 1 and model 2 and between model 4 and model 5). Correlations between models that included different traits were somewhat lower  ranging from 0.82 to 0.94  which was expected since the traits included in the study were correlated. The correlations between the estimated breeding values for health status  obtained by the different models  were also generally high (Table ). The lowest correlation and thus the highest re-ranking was observed between Model 2 and the other mixture models  indicating that the health status was judged differently when assumed to affect both growth and sexual maturation. Posterior mean predictive log-scores of Models 1 and 2 differed by 88 to 142 for the five replicates (Table )  in favor of Model 2 for all sub-sets. Hence  the results strongly indicate that a mixture model predicts novel observations systematically more accurately than a classical linear model. All mixture models consistently outperformed the classical model  but the comparisons between mixture models were less conclusive  giving small differences between the models and different ranking of the models between the different subsets (Table ). In this data  fish surviving the IPN outbreak had low and skewed growth distributions. Furthermore  an unusually large fraction of non-maturing fish  especially among males  was observed. A possible explanation for these results may be that the disease not only affected survival  but that health status differed among survivors and potentially had an impact on the growth rate and the reproductive development of the fish. Mixture models were used to identify such animals (runts) based on their observed growth rates and sexual maturation. This study used the liability-normal mixture model developed by Ødegård et al. []. Within the field of animal breeding  this methodology has been applied to somatic cell score data of dairy cows  with the aim to identify unobserved cases of subclinical mastitis []  and also to estimate breeding values for resistance to unobserved subclinical mastitis []. In this study  we used this methodology to infer health status based on observed growth rates in salmon in a multiple-trait analysis. Furthermore  some of the models were extended to involve a mixture of probits [] with respect to sexual maturity  i.e.  assuming that the unobserved health status affected both the observed growth and the liability for sexual maturation. The mixture models applied in this study seemed to fit the data well  as indicated by the improved predictive ability of the mixture models compared to a standard classical model (Table ). The estimated heritabilities for liability for survival in the field (IPN) ranged from 0.47 to 0.48  similar to earlier reported estimates for IPN survival (in both challenge and field tests) [–]. Heritabilities for (healthy) growth rate  ranging from 0.25 to 0.35  and sexual maturation (at normal age)  ranging from 0.32 to 0.33  were also similar to other reported estimates [  ]. Wild et al. [] reported lower heritability estimates (on the liability scale) for early sexual maturity across several test farms (0.10 and 0.17 for the two studied year-classes and derived from the sire component of variance)  which may be an effect of the significant genotype by test farm interaction that they identified. Our positive genetic correlations between growth rate and normal sexual maturation (0.34-0.39) are higher than the estimates reported by Gjerde et al. [] but of the same magnitude as the estimates between growth and early sexual maturity reported by Gjerde and Gjedrem []. Comparisons of the different mixture models  including different traits  through their ability to predict growth  showed small and inconsistent differences between the models. The small differences between Models 2  3 and 4 indicate that inclusion of other traits had only minor effects on the ability to predict growth. However  since predictive abilities with respect to the other traits (survival and sexual maturation) were not included  this only shows a part of the full picture. The comparison of Models 4 and 5  which included the same traits  was slightly in favor of Model 4 in four out of the five subsets of data  suggesting that assuming no genetic variance in runt growth might be desirable  but this did not have large effects on the predictive ability of the model. The current models did not include any effect common to full-sibs. This type of effect may arise from the separate rearing of the full-sib families until tagging (as well as potential non-additive genetic effects)  and  if present  may bias the estimated heritability upwards. However  a preliminary analysis using standard (non-mixture) linear models for growth with ASREML []  estimated a common environmental variance of only 2% of the genetic variance  and a likelihood ratio test of a growth model with and without a common environmental effect for full-sibs in the model gave a test statistic of 0. The common environmental effect was thus removed from the final models to prevent over-parameterization of the models. If common environmental effects existed  although not detected in the preliminary analyses  genetic variances may be over-estimated  but this bias seems small  since parameter estimates fit well with those found in the literature. The different models were inconsistent in the estimated proportions of runts. The simplest mixture model  in which health status was assumed to affect growth only (Model 2)  indicated that 6% of the surviving fish were runts (Table ). This was an unexpectedly low proportion  judged by the skewed distributions of growth rate (Figure ) and the low levels of growth and sexual maturation  as well as the knowledge that IPN could affect growth [] and that this disease was probably the main cause of the high mortality (72%) in this population. Preliminary analyses applying mixture models without including sexual maturation as a fixed effect (results not shown)  gave about 13% runts. Hence  sexual maturation and health status appeared to be confounded and may thus pick up some of the same effects. If sexual maturation was affected by health status  it may explain both the confounding of maturation and health effects and the different shapes of the growth distributions for maturing and non-maturing fish. Model 3 and extensions thereof (mixtures of probits) appeared to be able to handle a situation where the disease affected both sexual maturation and growth rate. With these models  a much higher proportion of the fish was classified as runts (Table )  especially among the non-maturing animals. A single-trait mixture model for maturation would not be able to distinguish between the effects of health and sexual maturation (i.e.  the binary sexual maturation status being affected by the binary and unobserved health status). Identification of runts in the proposed models is facilitated by the assumption that occurrence of infection gives a simultaneous unfavorable effect on both observed growth and liability for sexual maturation. However  the models did not have much power to distinguish between the effects of health and sexual maturation  and the apparent negative genetic correlation between these traits may be a result of a partial confounding of these effects  even when including all the relevant traits in the analysis. The other factor that affected the estimated proportions of healthy animals was whether a genetic effect of growth in runts was included or not. This implies that being infected does not necessarily result in the same reduction in growth for all animals  i.e. such models may capture genetic variation in disease tolerance []. Theoretically  it seems restrictive to assume that only growth in healthy animals is affected by genetics  and our results appeared valid  even when an additive genetic effect specific to growth of runts was included. However  there are some interpretation issues with respect to the genetics of runt growth  because it changes the definition of runt from a clearly defined situation where putative runts show poor growth irrespective of their genetic growth potential  to a less clear defined situation where growth is more or less reduced (depending on the breeding value for growth in the runt vs. breeding value of the same animal when considered healthy). This change of definition led to more fish defined as runts. The weak estimated genetic correlation between growth in runts and growth in healthy fish indicates that growth in runts is a complex trait that may be affected by other factors besides genetic growth potential  possibly related to disease tolerance. In this context  tolerance should be interpreted as the severity of the symptoms after infection  while resistance describes the risk of getting infected. The genetic correlation between health  which can thus be interpreted as a measurement of resistance  and runt growth  which can be seen as a measurement of tolerance  was low  indicating that resistance and tolerance are different traits. Both these traits were however positively correlated to survival  indicating that resistance against a fatal infection has an influence on both the risk of being affected if one has survived and the severity of the symptoms if affected. Hence  breeding for survival will probably alter both resistance and tolerance to the disease. Still  extending the model to also include a runt-specific genetic effect on growth appeared to reduce the predictive ability of the model (4 vs. 5) with respect to growth. Hence  these results should be interpreted with care. The proposed mixture models could be useful to model growth in disease-infested environments. The method gives consistent estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations between traits  and makes it possible to estimate breeding values for health  or environmental robustness  that might be more informative than a standard survival analysis based on challenge tests only. Furthermore  the mixture model (Model 2) had a consistently higher predictive ability than the conventional non-mixture model (Model 1)  indicating that mixture models are more appropriate to analyse this type of data. However  the low proportion of maturing fish  the low average growth and the large deviations of phenotypic growth distributions from the normal distribution cannot be explained by the occurrence of only 5% runts  as indicated by Model 2. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the more complex models that yield higher proportions of runts also have fewer misclassifications  and probably have greater predictive ability than the simpler Model 2. In the case of IPN in Atlantic salmon  runts may not only occur as a direct effect of IPN  but may also occur as an indirect effect of secondary infections. Thus  health status (runt/healthy) and IPN resistance may be partially different traits. This may explain the rather low genetic correlation between liability to being healthy and liability for survival. In a scenario like this  additional information obtained by the mixture models can be of particular importance as a supplement to challenge test data  e.g.  if the aim is to model not only the risk of dying from the infection  but also the risk of secondary problems among the survivors. Furthermore  the method may be especially relevant for non-lethal diseases/conditions that cause losses in terms of growth (or other indicator traits)  or if the pathogenic load has to be increased to unrealistic levels to be able to observe mortality (e.g.  pancreas disease in salmon). It may also be possible to use data from natural disease outbreaks more efficiently.

The extent of linkage disequilibrium was similar in the Chinese and Nordic Holstein populations and the consistency of linkage disequilibrium between the two populations was very high  with a correlation of 0.97. Genomic prediction using the joint versus the Chinese reference dataset increased reliabilities of genomic predictions of Chinese Holstein bulls in the test data from 0.22  0.15 and 0.11 to 0.51  0.47 and 0.36 for milk yield  fat yield and protein yield  respectively. Using five-fold cross-validation  reliabilities of genomic predictions of Chinese cows increased from 0.15  0.12 and 0.15 to 0.26  0.17 and 0.20 for milk yield  fat yield and protein yield  respectively. The linkage disequilibrium between the two populations was very consistent and using the combined Nordic and Chinese reference dataset substantially increased reliabilities of genomic predictions for Chinese Holstein cattle. Genomic selection was proposed in 2001 [] and has since then become a major research topic in animal breeding. Accuracy of genomic prediction depends greatly on the size of the reference population [  ]. The larger the reference population  the more accurate genomic prediction is. It was reported that reliabilities of genomic prediction of Holstein cattle increased when Holstein cattle of other countries were added to the reference dataset [–]. Similarly  pooling genotypes from other countries or populations to form a common reference population helped to increase the reliability of predictions in Brown Swiss cattle [  ]. In addition  reliabilities of genomic prediction obtained by combining the reference populations of Danish  Swedish and Finnish red cattle were higher than those using single-country reference populations []. Holstein dairy cattle in China were originally imported from Europe and North America and were mostly derived from cross-breeding between the local yellow cattle and imported foreign Holstein bulls. It is assumed that the current Chinese Holstein population is genetically close to the other Holstein populations in the world. To date  the reference population of genotyped Holstein cattle in China is relatively small and includes mainly cows. It is expected that a joint reference dataset that combines Chinese Holstein cattle and Holstein cattle from other populations will greatly improve the reliability of genomic predictions of the Chinese Holstein population  assuming linkage disequilibrium between markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) is consistent between the populations. The objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the consistency of linkage disequilibrium between the Chinese and the Nordic Holstein populations and (2) assess the gains in reliability of genomic predictions in Chinese Holstein from using a joint Chinese and Nordic reference dataset  compared with using the Chinese reference dataset alone. In this study  both the Chinese Holstein (CH) and Nordic Holstein (NH) cattle were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of each population were edited separately by deleting SNP with minor allele frequencies less than 0.01 or call rates less than 0.10  and excluding individuals with more than 10% missing marker genotypes. After editing  41 838 SNP on 29 autosomes were retained in both populations. The genotyped CH cattle included 80 bulls born between 1993 and 2002 and 2091 cows born between 2001 and 2006  which were daughters of 13 of the genotyped bulls. The number of daughters per bull ranged from 63 to 358  with a mean of 135. The genotyped NH cattle included 5216 bulls born between 1974 and 2008. All animals of both populations were used in the linkage disequilibrium analysis. Deregressed proofs (DRP) were used as phenotypes for genomic prediction. DRP of CH bulls and cows were derived from the estimated breeding values (EBV) obtained from the Chinese genetic evaluations in April 2012 (Dairy Association of China)  and DRP of NH bulls were derived from the EBV of Nordic genetic evaluations in November 2010 (Nordic Genetic Evaluation). Three traits (milk yield  fat yield and protein yield) were analyzed. In total  4398 NH bulls and all CH animals had phenotypes for the three traits. 512 CH cows with possible incorrect sire information were discarded based on parentage verification with 255 SNP performed in a previous study [] in which paternity was considered incorrect if five or more SNP were in conflict (i.e.  a sire was homozygous for one allele but its daughter was homozygous for the other allele). Consequently  1572 CH cows and 80 CH bulls with reliable pedigree information were used for genomic prediction. Each chromosome was phased separately using Beagle [] for each population  and all missing genotypes were simultaneously imputed by Beagle. Linkage disequilibrium between a pair of SNP was measured as []  and  was calculated as follows: where f(AB)  f(A)  f(a)  f(B) and f(b) are observed frequencies of haplotype AB  alleles A  a  B and b  respectively. Maternal and paternal haplotypes were pooled to calculate LD. The consistency of LD in the two populations was measured by the correlation of  of adjacent marker pairs on each autosome between the two populations []. A single-trait GBLUP model was used for genomic prediction based on the Chinese reference dataset  and a two-trait GBLUP was used for genomic prediction based on the joint reference dataset that included both the CH and NH cattle. In the latter  a single biological trait was regarded as a different trait in the two populations. The basic GBLUP model [  ] was where  is the vector of phenotypes   is the population mean   is the vector of breeding values   is the vector of residuals  and  is a design matrix allocating  to . It was assumed that  and   where  is the genomic relationship matrix   is the additive genetic variance   is a diagonal matrix with weights of the residual variance []  and  is the residual variance. The  matrix was constructed according to the method (method 1) described by VanRaden []  i.e. <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>'/<U+2211>2(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)  where elements in column i of  are 0 - 2p  1 - 2p and 2 - 2p for genotypes AA  AA and AA  respectively  and p is the allele frequency of A at locus i  calculated from the available marker data. Variances and covariances in the GBLUP models were estimated using the “average information” restricted maximum likelihood algorithm  and the GBLUP analyses were conducted using the DMU Package []. Accuracy of genomic predictions using the CH and the joint reference datasets was assessed by two validation procedures. In the first procedure  the reference dataset comprised 13 genotyped CH bulls and their genotyped daughters and the test dataset consisted of 48 CH bulls without genotyped daughters. The remaining 19 CH bulls  which were highly related with the 13 reference bulls  were not used in the test dataset. In the second procedure  a five-fold cross-validation procedure was used for genomic prediction of CH cows. In each fold of cross-validation  two or three half-sib families of cows were used as the test dataset and the remaining cows and genotyped CH bulls were used as reference dataset. The numbers of animals in the reference and test datasets for the two validation procedures are shown in Table<U+2009>. Genomic EBV (GEBV) for the animals in a test dataset were predicted using both the CH and the joint reference datasets. The joint reference dataset included all 4398 Nordic bulls. Reliabilities of GEBV for bulls and cows were measured as the squared correlation of GEBV and DRP divided by the average reliabilities of the DRP in the test dataset (Cor/r) []. Because CH bulls were born between 1993 and 2002  genetic trend due to selection could inflate the correlation between GEBV and DRP. Therefore  in the validation of genomic predictions for CH bulls  genetic trends present in GEBV and DRP were corrected by regressing on birth year  and then the reliabilities were calculated by correlating the corrected GEBV and DRP. In the validation of genomic predictions for cows  reliabilities were calculated based on GEBV pooled over the five test datasets. Data on the 41 838 SNP distributed over the 29 bovine autosomes are summarized in Table<U+2009>. The average distance between adjacent SNP was 59.59 Kb  and the shortest and longest gaps were 3<U+2009>bp (on BTA7) and 3820 Kb (on BTA10). As shown in Figure<U+2009>  most distances between adjacent markers were less than 100 Kb. However  2.55% adjacent SNP had large distance gaps (larger than 200 Kb). This indicates that SNP used in the current study were not evenly distributed over the bovine chromosomes.                                                      Figure<U+2009> presents the distribution of  of adjacent SNP pairs in the CH and NH populations. The LD between adjacent SNP pairs was generally small. The proportion of adjacent SNP pairs which had an  < 0.01 was 15.2% for CH and 17.6% for NH; the proportion with an  < 0.1 was 52.81% for CH and 51.72% for NH. These results indicate that the SNP markers did not effectively capture all the QTL affecting a trait  since most adjacent SNP pairs were in weak LD. The mean  of adjacent SNP pairs within a chromosome ranged from 0.16 to 0.24 in CH and from 0.16 to 0.25 in NH. The mean  across all chromosomes was 0.20 in CH and 0.21 in NH. The consistency of LD between the CH and NH populations was high (Table<U+2009>). The correlation of  of adjacent SNP ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 across all chromosomes  with a mean of 0.97 at an average marker distance of 60 Kb.                                                                                 The mean  in the CH and NH populations was similar to the degree of LD reported for the Holstein populations in Germany []  in the Netherlands  Australia and New Zealand []  and in North America []. The consistency of LD between the CH and NH populations agreed with the consistency of LD between the Dutch and Australian Holstein bulls reported in [] and was in line with the development of the CH population. The first dairy cattle imported in China came from Europe in the 1870’s [] and since then  Holstein cattle have continuously been imported from Europe  Japan and North America. The imported Holstein bulls were crossed with local yellow cattle  and the crossbred cows were continuously back-crossed with the imported Holstein bulls []. The resulting crossed black and white dairy cattle were officially named Chinese Holsteins in 1992. Currently  most of the Holstein bulls found in China were imported from worldwide in the form of embryos or live cattle. Besides  the NH population has also exchanged genetic material with the United States  the Netherlands  Germany and other countries. The genomic relationship matrix showed that some CH bulls could be full-sibs or half-sibs of the NH bulls. Based on these data  it can be inferred that the Chinese Holstein population is genetically close to European and North American Holstein cattle. Reliabilities of GEBV for the 48 CH test bulls that had no genotyped daughters and the 1572 CH cows in the test dataset with the five-fold cross-validation are presented in Table<U+2009>. When the CH cattle were used as the reference data  the reliabilities of GEBV were 0.16 for CH test bulls and 0.14 for CH cows  averaged over the three traits. When using the joint reference dataset  the average reliabilities increased to 0.45 for CH bulls and to 0.21 for CH cows. Based on data from the Dairy Association of China  the reliability of a conventional pedigree index (calculated as 0.5*sire EBV<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.25*maternal grandsire EBV) in the CH population was 0.12 for milk production traits. Thus  the reliabilities of genomic predictions based on the CH reference population were of similar magnitude as the reliabilities of a pedigree index  and the genomic predictions based on the joint reference population gave much higher reliabilities than those based on a pedigree index. The low reliabilities of genomic predictions using the CH reference dataset alone suggested that the information in the CH reference dataset  which mainly contained cows  was insufficient. According to Goddard []  the reliability of GEBV for different sizes of reference population and different heritabilities of traits can be predicted as: where  is the number of individuals in the reference population and . According to Hayes et al. []    <U+2009>  and  where  is the effective population size and  is the length of the genome in Morgans. Using the above formula  the reliability of GEBV based on the CH reference dataset was expected to be 0.175  assuming <U+2009>=<U+2009>30  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1500 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50. The reliabilities obtained from the validation procedures were consistent with these expected reliabilities. The results indicate that the size of the CH reference population needs to be increased in order to increase the reliability of genomic predictions. Dairy cattle reference populations usually comprise progeny-tested bulls to maximize the information from each genotyped individual. In some countries or in some cattle populations where the number of progeny-tested bulls is small  one solution is to include cows in the reference population. In order to evaluate the value of adding cows to the reference dataset  an additional analysis was performed using a CH reference dataset from which 50% of the cows were deleted. The reliabilities of GEBV for the CH bulls using the reduced CH reference dataset decreased to 0.09  0.03 and 0.05 for milk yield  fat yield and protein yield  respectively. This indirectly demonstrates that it is feasible to use cows as reference animals for genomic prediction  when the number of available progeny-tested bulls is not sufficient. A simulation study by Mc Hugh et al. [] also suggested that genomic information from cows could greatly increase genetic gain and accuracy of male selection. To increase the size of the cow reference population at low cost  a good alternative would be to genotype cows using a low density chip like the Bovine LD (7<U+2009>K) and then impute the genotypes for the 54<U+2009>K panel. The joint reference dataset greatly improved the reliability of genomic predictions for the CH cattle. The reliabilities of GEBV for CH bulls based on the joint reference dataset were close to those for NH bulls based on the Nordic reference data []. Several studies have reported that the reliability of genomic prediction can be increased by using a joint reference dataset that includes reference animals from other populations. The reliabilities of GEBV increased by 10% on average when four European Holstein populations were combined into a reference dataset  compared to when only one national population was used as the reference population []. Reliabilities of genomic prediction for Canadian Holstein bulls increased by 6% on average when about 3000 foreign bulls were included in the reference dataset []  and by 7% when all North American sires were included []. Reliabilities were 2.6% higher for Holstein and 3.2% higher for Brown Swiss cattle when 3593 foreign Holstein and 732 foreign Brown Swiss animals were included in the reference dataset of the USA domestic prediction []. With the joint reference dataset  reliabilities of genomic predictions improved more for CH bulls than for CH cows i.e. by 2.3 fold for CH bulls and only by 1.7 fold for CH cows. This is due to the fact that CH bulls have a closer relationship with NH bulls than the CH cows do. Among the 48 CH test bulls  14 bulls had a genomic relationship with one or more NH bull in the range from 0.45 to 0.56. However  no CH cow had this level of relationship with any NH bull. Moreover  among the 48 CH test bulls  33 (68.75%) had a genomic relationship greater than 0.2 with at least one NH bull (with 15.5 bulls on average). Among the 1572 CH cows  only 459 (29.2%) had a genomic relationship greater than 0.2 with an NH bull (with 1.3 bulls on average). Many previous studies reported that the existence of a close relationship between test animals and reference animals increased the reliability of genomic predictions for the test animals [–]. To avoid overestimation of the reliability of GEBV  19 CH bulls were excluded from the test dataset because they were highly related to 13 bulls in the reference population. In the five-fold cross-validation for the CH cows  two or three half-sib families were randomly assigned to a single-test dataset  instead of randomly choosing individuals. This was done to avoid overestimation of the reliability of GEBV when animals in the test dataset have a large group of half-sibs in the reference dataset. Moreover  genetic trend can increase the correlation between GEBV and DRP if the birth years of the animals in the test dataset cover a wide range. Therefore  in the validation for the CH bulls  the correlation between GEBV and DRP was calculated after correcting for genetic trend. When ignoring this correction  the validation reliabilities of genomic predictions for CH bulls using the joint reference dataset were unrealistically high at 0.69  0.54 and 0.60 for milk yield  fat yield and protein yield  respectively. In the current study  when using the joint reference dataset  genomic predictions were estimated using a two-trait model  in which the same biological trait was considered to be a different trait in the CH and NH populations. The reason for using a two-trait model  instead of a single-trait model  was that the DRP had different scales in the two populations due to the use of a standardization procedure in the NH population. The two-trait model also accounts for the presence of any genotype by environment interactions. When genotypes of bulls from three foreign countries were included in the USA domestic predictions  multi-trait methods were not more accurate than the single-trait model for Holstein cattle  but gave higher reliabilities (1.4% higher on average) for Brown Swiss cattle []. The authors suggested that this could be due to lower genetic correlations of traits between Brown Swiss populations. Using the two-trait GBLUP model  the estimated genetic correlations between the CH and NH populations were 0.85  0.70 and 0.75 for milk yield  fat yield and protein yield respectively  which were much lower than the value of the consistency of LD of neighboring markers  which was 0.97 between the two populations. Assuming that the consistency of LD was appropriate to represent the genetic associations between different populations  its clear difference with the estimated genetic correlations suggests the existence of a large genotype by environment interaction between China and Nordic countries. The consistency of LD is very high between the CH and NH populations  indicating a high level of genetic similarity between the two populations. Genomic prediction for CH cattle can be greatly improved using a joint reference dataset that includes CH and NH cattle. In order to obtain satisfactory reliabilities of genomic predictions for CH cattle  it is necessary to increase the size of the CH reference population or to include foreign Holstein cattle in the reference population.

To do so  it is necessary to distinguish direct and indirect mechanisms of resistance and tolerance because selection on these traits is believed to have different epidemiological and evolutionary consequences.MethodsWe propose structural equation models with latent variables (1) to quantify the latent risk of infection and to identify  among the many potential mediators of infection  the few ones that influence it significantly and (2) to estimate direct and indirect levels of tolerance of animals infected naturally with pathogens. We applied the method to two surveys of bovine mastitis in the Walloon region of Belgium  in which we recorded herd management practices  mastitis frequency  and results of bacteriological analyses of milk samples.Results and discussionStructural equation models suggested that  among more than 35 surveyed herd characteristics  only nine (age  addition of urea in the rations  treatment of subclinical mastitis  presence of dirty liner  cows with hyperkeratotic teats  machine stripping  pre- and post-milking teat disinfection  and housing of milking cows in cubicles) were directly and significantly related to a latent measure of bovine mastitis  and that treatment of subclinical mastitis was involved in the pathway between post-milking teat disinfection and latent mastitis. These models also allowed the separation of direct and indirect effects of bacterial infection on milk productivity. Results suggested that infected cows were tolerant but not resistant to mastitis pathogens.ConclusionsWe revealed the advantages of structural equation models  compared to classical models  for dissecting measurements of resistance and tolerance to infectious diseases  here bovine mastitis.

To do so  it is necessary to distinguish direct and indirect mechanisms of resistance and tolerance because selection on these traits is believed to have different epidemiological and evolutionary consequences. We propose structural equation models with latent variables (1) to quantify the latent risk of infection and to identify  among the many potential mediators of infection  the few ones that influence it significantly and (2) to estimate direct and indirect levels of tolerance of animals infected naturally with pathogens. We applied the method to two surveys of bovine mastitis in the Walloon region of Belgium  in which we recorded herd management practices  mastitis frequency  and results of bacteriological analyses of milk samples. Structural equation models suggested that  among more than 35 surveyed herd characteristics  only nine (age  addition of urea in the rations  treatment of subclinical mastitis  presence of dirty liner  cows with hyperkeratotic teats  machine stripping  pre- and post-milking teat disinfection  and housing of milking cows in cubicles) were directly and significantly related to a latent measure of bovine mastitis  and that treatment of subclinical mastitis was involved in the pathway between post-milking teat disinfection and latent mastitis. These models also allowed the separation of direct and indirect effects of bacterial infection on milk productivity. Results suggested that infected cows were tolerant but not resistant to mastitis pathogens. We revealed the advantages of structural equation models  compared to classical models  for dissecting measurements of resistance and tolerance to infectious diseases  here bovine mastitis. Using our method  we identified nine major risk factors that were directly associated with an increased risk of mastitis and suggested that cows were tolerant but not resistant to mastitis. Selection should aim at improved resistance to infection by mastitis pathogens  although further investigations are needed due to the limitations of the data used in this study. Public concern about farm animal welfare has steadily grown during recent years and scientists have searched methods to improve the ability of animals to defend themselves against pathogens. One method is to select as reproducers  animals with the highest ability to fight infection. Indeed  it is well established that this ability varies substantially among and within breeds and is at least partly under genetic control []. The ability to fight infection may be characterized by two mechanisms: resistance  i.e.  the ability to limit the parasite burden  and tolerance  i.e.  the ability to limit the damage caused by a given parasite burden []. Operationally  resistance is typically measured by the number of parasites per host or per unit of host tissue [  ] while tolerance is defined as the slope of a regression of host performance against infection intensity [  ]. Mechanisms of resistance and tolerance can be further differentiated into direct and indirect mechanisms. Resistance traits are ‘direct’ when they reduce pathogen transmission by contact (resistance to infection) and ‘indirect’ when they reduce pathogen growth rate once infection has occurred  through the establishment of an immune response (resistance to disease). Tolerance traits are direct when they aim at reducing damage inflicted by the pathogen and indirect when the damage is caused by the immune response []. The distinction between these traits is important when determining selection objectives because they are predicted to have different evolutionary effects on pathogens and hosts [  ] and they have been found to be negatively genetically correlated in plants and mice []. One way to test whether mechanisms are direct or indirect is to use structural equation models (SEM). These are multiple-equation regression models in which the response variable in one regression equation can appear as an explanatory variable in another equation. Variables can influence one-another reciprocally  either directly  or indirectly. A direct effect occurs if an explanatory variable influences the response variable directly  i.e.  with no variables in the pathway between explanatory and response variables  and an indirect effect occurs when the influence of the explanatory variable on the response variable is mediated by one or more intervening variables. The sum of direct and indirect effects is the total effect []. The SEM can also be used to estimate the risk of infection  which is necessary to compare levels of direct resistance of animals placed in natural conditions. Indeed  the number of parasites in resistant animals living in an infected environment may be identical (or even higher) to the number detected in susceptible animals located in a clean environment. Therefore  for a fair evaluation  it is necessary to compare animals with the same opportunity or risk of encountering the pathogen. Unfortunately  estimating this risk of infection is not possible in field studies  since detailed and expensive epidemiological and laboratory data are needed  such as structures of contact between hosts and time data on when infection enters the population. An alternative is to characterize the risk of infection in each herd based on management practices known to influence it significantly and to classify herds into categories  from ‘high-risk’ to ‘low-risk’  based on these management practices. Herd management practices known to influence the risk of infection are numerous. For example  in bovine mastitis  Dufour et al. [] identified more than one hundred such management practices. Besides being too numerous to be all surveyed on a routine basis  these practices are interrelated. One way to reduce the complexity of such situations is to use SEM with latent variables. A latent variable is a variable that cannot be measured but is inferred from one or more observed variables []. Management practices related to the risk of infection can then be aggregated in a few numbers of latent variables and alternative hypotheses about the relationships between latent variables and risk of infection can be tested. The objective of this paper was to apply SEM to bovine mastitis. Specifically  we used SEM to (1) identify management practices that are directly related to the risk of infection in dairy herds of the Walloon region of Belgium and (2) estimate direct and indirect levels of tolerance of cows located in these herds. Data were from a random stratified sample of 345 dairy farms surveyed between January 2006 and October 2007 in the Walloon region of Belgium (project OSaM ‘Observatoire de la Santé Mammaire’). Farm characteristics and measures of herd prevalence were recorded for each farm. A complete description of animals and measurements can be found in Detilleux et al. []. Briefly  measures of mastitis prevalence (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>6) included herd average of individual somatic cell count (SCC)  herd somatic cell score (SCS)  number and percentage of cows with SCC above 400 000 cells  and of cows milked aside because of high SCC. Farm characteristics (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>35) consisted of herd demographics  productive and reproductive indicators  feeding procedures  types of housing  strategies of mastitis prevention and treatment  and milking methods. We considered 28 latent variables in the first equation of the SEM  often called the ‘measurement’ part of the SEM. Each latent variable covered observed variables that were significantly associated with each other (one-to-one association; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10). The first latent variable (<U+03B7>  called ‘MAM’) included all six measures of mastitis frequency. The second latent variable (<U+03B7>  called ‘AGE’) covered herd parity  age  and percentage of heifers in the herd. The third latent variable (<U+03B7>  called ‘PROD’) included milk production  protein and fat percentages  and total milk quota. The fourth latent variable (<U+03B7>  called ‘NUM’) covered the number of lactating and dry cows  and the fifth included time to prepare the udder  delay in installing the machine and the practice of hand washing after milking (<U+03B7> or ‘MLK’). The remaining 23 latent variables corresponded to the remaining 23 observed variables because no one-to-one associations were found among them. In the second equation of the SEM  the ‘structural’ part of the SEM  we modeled the links among the 28 latent variables (<U+03B7>). The premises for constructing this part of the SEM were that all latent variables could affect MAM and be themselves affected by latent variables other than MAM and by the variable itself. In matrix notation  the SEM is: where  is the (41 X 1) vector of observed variables   is the corresponding (28 X 1) vector for latent variables  and  and  are the corresponding vectors of error terms. It is assumed E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  var()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  and var()<U+2009>=<U+2009>. Elements (<U+03BB>) of  are partial regression coefficients relating latent variables to the observed variables  while elements (ß) of  connected latent variables among them (direct and indirect effects). All computations were done with the LISREL program 2.8 []  using the maximum likelihood–mean adjusted method []. Following []  we considered as final  the model that had the superior fit. This model was the model for which the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05  the Goodness of Fit Index (GFI)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9  the Normed Fit Index (NFI)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9  and for which partial regression coefficients (ß) were not different from null (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Data were from cows belonging to four farms surveyed by the project OSAM. During April 2012  two surveyors collected milk samples from 346 cows  immediately before evening milking. They cleaned teat ends with alcohol swabs and allowed them to dry. They discarded the first few streams and collected milk samples in sterile plastic tubes. Samples were immediately cooled  transported in cool bags to the Bacteriology laboratory of the Veterinary Faculty in Liège  and stored overnight at 4°C. In the absence of macroscopic alteration of the milk  one mL from each quarter of a cow were pooled and 100 µL were inoculated onto Columbia base agar (Merck-VWR  Belgium) plates supplemented with 5% bovine blood that were incubated overnight at 37°C. Milk samples with less than 100<U+2009>CFU/mL of one/two or of several different colony types were marked as ‘negative’ or ‘contaminated’  respectively. Samples with over 100<U+2009>CFU/mL were marked as ‘positive’ if a maximum of two types of colonies were detected. Samples with over 100<U+2009>CFU/mL and more than two colony types were also marked as ‘positive’ (but contaminated) if one colony type had counted for over 100<U+2009>CFU/mL. Milk samples with macroscopic alterations and from each quarter of the ‘positive’ cows were individually inoculated onto the same blood agar plates and incubated overnight. Growth results were analyzed as described above. Counts from duplicate plates were averaged and CFU/mL were recorded as total bacterial infective dose for each quarter. Colonies from positive samples were identified to the following groups according to Gram staining  production of catalase and/or oxidase  production of haemolysis on blood agar plates and growth on selective agar plates (Table<U+2009>): Gassner (Merck-VWR  Belgium) for lactose fermentation by enterobacteria  Chapman (Merck-VWR  Belgium) for staphylococci growth and modified Edwards Medium (Oxoid  Belgium) with 5% bovine blood for esculin hydrolysis by streptococci/enterococci []. For statistical analyses  only the genus of major or minor mammary gland bacteria (Table<U+2009>) was taken into account. We computed udder-composite CFU as the sum of CFU of all bacterial species and all quarters  and restricted our study on direct and indirect tolerances to cows with udder-composite CFU<U+2009>><U+2009>0. We extracted data on udder-composite SCC (SCC<U+2009>=<U+2009>n cells/10<U+2009>per<U+2009>mL) and milk yield (= kg*10) from the regional milk-recording database from the date closest to the date when milk samples were collected. We computed bulk tank SCC by weighting individual SCC of all cows present in the herd by their milk production. We log-transformed SCC and CFU (base 2) so their distributions were closer to normality. Next  we constructed latent variables (denoted SCC*  CFU*  and milk*) for log(SCC)  log(CFU) and milk yield to translate the fact that observed values were not error-free. We postulated four different SEM to analyze the possible interrelations between SCC*  CFU* and milk*  considering milk* as the end-point. Possible causal relations between SCC* and CFU* that were investigated were: (a) CFU* and SCC* are unrelated (null model)  (b) CFU* influences SCC* (bacterial infection elicits an immune response)  and (c) SCC* influences CFU* (immune response impacts bacterial infection). Each model included also the potential effects of bulk tank SCC  month in milk (fourth degree polynomial) and parity. In matrix notation  the SEM is: where  is the vector of observed CFU  SCC and milk yield;  is the corresponding vector for latent variables (CFU*  SCC*  MILK*);  is the vector for the effects of bulk tank SCC  parity and month in milk;  and  are the corresponding vectors of error terms  with E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  var()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  E()<U+2009>=<U+2009>  and var()<U+2009>=<U+2009>. Elements of  and  were assumed independent. We performed statistical analyses with SAS9.1 using the CALIS procedure []. Parameters and effects (direct  indirect and total) were estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the data. Standard errors for effects were obtained by boostrapping the sample cows (1000 samples). Fit criteria included RMSEA  GFI and NFI []. Goodness-of-fit statistics (RMSEA<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01  NFI<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95  and GFI<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0) indicated that the final SEM closely fitted data. Standardized estimates of elements of  (measurement model) were close to or above 0.5 and significantly different from 0 at the 0.01 level  suggesting that the observed measurements were valid indicators of their corresponding latent variables []. Standardized estimates of elements of  (structural model) retained in the final SEM are given in Figure<U+2009>. Only nine herd characteristics (AGE  addition of urea in the rations  presence of dirty liners  cows with hyperkeratotic teats  machine stripping  pre- and post-milking teat disinfection  and housing of milking cows in cubicles) were directly and significantly related to MAM. The three most influential variables increasing MAM were the presence of dirty liners  followed by the addition of dietary urea  and the practice of pre-milking teat disinfection. In contrast  post-milking teat disinfection (the only variable with a coefficient below -0.10) was negatively associated with MAM  with a direct standardized link of -0.12 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02). Post-dipping was also indirectly and positively associated with MAM through its effect on the intervening variable ‘Treatment of subclinical cases of mastitis’. Latent variables PROD and NUMB were indirectly rather than directly associated with MAM  through their effects on some of the practices directly associated with MAM.                                                      Averages over all infected cows (28%) of CFU  SCC and milk yield were 1108 268 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>98 940) CFU/mL  631 674 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>62 566) SCC/mL and 28.85 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.55) kg/day. For the remaining uninfected cows (63%)  averages were 310 045 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>28 073) SCC/mL and 26.78 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.31) kg milk. Samples from the remaining 9% of cows were contaminated. Non-haemolytic staphylococci and a haemolytic streptococci were the pathogens most frequently isolated (Table<U+2009>). Global fit indices were high for all three SEM  with RMSEA<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01  and GFI and NFI<U+2009>><U+2009>0.95. More than 95% of the variance in observed CFU  SCC and MILK was explained by the variance in their corresponding latent variable CFU*  SCC* and MILK* (measurement model). Unstandardized estimates of direct effects (elements of ) are given in Table<U+2009> for all SEM: direct effects on MILK* were negative for both CFU* and SCC* but significantly (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) different from 0 only for SCC*. The indirect effect of CFU* on MILK*  mediated through its effect on SCC*  was -0.50 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37) but was also not significantly different from 0. The total effect was estimated at -3.43 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.12). We presented SEM (1) to identify herd characteristics directly related to the risk of infection by mastitis pathogens and (2) to evaluate direct and indirect levels of tolerance of cows from these herds. The SEM approach has several advantages compared to classical methods  such as analysis of variance or regression. Advantages include greater abilities (1) to model complex patterns of relationships or differences between variables  (2) to generate latent variables and reduce measurement error  (3) to provide fit indices for the overall model in addition to individual coefficients  (4) to give a transparent representation of the assumptions built into the model  and (5) to develop mediating variables in addition to variables restricted to an additive model []. As such  SEM are useful tools to dissect resistance and tolerance to infectious diseases  and to define accurately the phenotypes corresponding to selection objectives. In the first part of our study  SEM treated six observed measures of mastitis as imperfect indicators of mastitis status at the herd level (MAM). Therefore  it provided a more accurate assessment of mastitis status than each observed variable taken separately. These six variables were the only ones available in our study but other ones could also be considered  such as the number of cows clinically ill or the herd average California Mastitis Test. Next  we used SEM to evaluate associations between herd characteristics and MAM. We found that nine out of 35 practices were directly and significantly related to MAM  and that four had standardized effects on MAM greater than 0.10. Other management practices had less importance because they either affected indirectly MAM or had direct standardized effects lower than 0.10. Therefore  one may suggest that ‘high-risk’ herds are herds (in our Walloon region) in which cows are pre- but not post-dipped  urea is added in the rations and liners are dirty. For selection purposes  the search for animals that are inherently resistant to infection should be restricted to this type of ‘high-risk’ herds because only in these herds can we be confident that uninfected cows are resistant to direct infection with mastitis pathogens. In other herds  uninfected cows may indeed be resistant but they can also be susceptible and not in contact with mastitis pathogens. In the second part of the study  we observed a high variability in the number of CFU in infected cows (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>98 940<U+2009>CFU/mL) suggesting that cows may differ in their levels of indirect resistance to mastitis pathogens. We also observed that losses in MILK* through direct and indirect association with CFU* were not significantly different from 0  suggesting that cows were both directly and indirectly tolerant (Table<U+2009>). Mastitis could thus spread within the herds because tolerance prolongs the survival of infected hosts  and thus of their pathogens  and this increases the risk of infection for both tolerant and non-tolerant hosts []. However  it should be noted that sample size and design of this study were not optimal to detect loss of milk related to presence of bacteria. In theory  bacteria belonging to  and  genera may directly damage tissues by producing several virulence factors and survive within mammary epithelial cells for extended periods of time without losing viability. These bacteria may also cause indirect harm because some of their cell wall-associated and secreted proteins are inflammatory []. If infected cows are indeed tolerant and with different levels of indirect resistance  one might wish to include indirect resistance in breeding objectives. This means that one should select cows in which phagocytes are mobilized efficiently from the blood to the udder. Unfortunately  such mobilization (and collateral increase in SCC) was accompanied by a loss estimated at around 9.8 units of MILK* per unit of SCC* (Table<U+2009>). Therefore  selection for increased indirect resistance to mastitis (by increasing the number of SCC* per CFU*) would lead to cows that are not tolerant when infected. This suggests that selection should aim at better resistance to infection by mastitis pathogens but further investigations are needed given the limitations of the design of the current study. Reversely to being advantageous  SEM also have some limits. They are only confirmatory in the sense that theory and design of the study drive the development of the model  as opposed to using data mining to develop a model []. Here  designs of both studies were cross-sectional and observational in nature (all variables were measured simultaneously)  so no causal inference could be made. Fit indices (RMSEA  GFI  NFI) were similar for the three SEM proposed in the second study and no causal direction between CFU*  SCC* and MILK* could be revealed. Therefore  SEM with other plausible configuration might match the data just as well as the SEM proposed here. Also  sample sizes need to be large enough to provide stable estimates of the parameters: a simplest rule of thumb states that sample sizes of 200 should provide sufficient statistical power []. This is lower than the sample size of our study but  given the limitations of its design  further investigations are necessary to validate our results and to better define direct and indirect effects (e.g.  non-linear relationships) of tolerance and resistance (e.g.  use of a temporal design; correction for moderators; large sample size; use of genetic lines or herds characterized for the risk of infection) to different bacterial species. This study described structural equation models with latent variables: (1) to assess the risk for an animal of being exposed to mastitis pathogens and (2) to evaluate direct and indirect levels of tolerance to mastitis. Using this method  we identified nine major risk factors directly associated with an increased risk of mastitis and suggested that cows were tolerant but not resistant to mastitis. The methodology can easily be generalized to other diseases and populations. Adams LG  Templeton JW: Genetic resistance to bacterial diseases of animals. Rev Sci Tech Off Int Epiz. 1998  17: 200-219.

One way to increase the accuracy of genomic prediction is to capture more linkage disequilibrium by regression on haplotypes instead of regression on individual markers. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of genomic prediction using haplotypes based on local genealogy information. A total of 4429 Danish Holstein bulls were genotyped with the 50K SNP chip. Haplotypes were constructed using local genealogical trees. Effects of haplotype covariates were estimated with two types of prediction models: (1) assuming that effects had the same distribution for all haplotype covariates  i.e. the GBLUP method and (2) assuming that a large proportion (p) of the haplotype covariates had zero effect  i.e. a Bayesian mixture method. About 7.5 times more covariate effects were estimated when fitting haplotypes based on local genealogical trees compared to fitting individuals markers. Genealogy-based haplotype clustering slightly increased the accuracy of genomic prediction and  in some cases  decreased the bias of prediction. With the Bayesian method  accuracy of prediction was less sensitive to parameter p when fitting haplotypes compared to fitting markers. Use of haplotypes based on genealogy can slightly increase the accuracy of genomic prediction. Improved methods to cluster the haplotypes constructed from local genealogy could lead to additional gains in accuracy. Genomic prediction is a method that uses genome-wide dense markers to predict additive genetic values []. It was originally assumed that the key feature of this method was that markers were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the quantitative trait loci (QTL) and explained most of the genetic variance []. However  the genetic variance explained by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers depends also on the additive genetic relationships between individuals. The accuracy of genomic prediction increases when the markers explain more additive genetic relationships between individuals. Previous studies e.g. [] have reported that accuracy of genomic prediction increases as the genetic relationship between candidates and reference animals increases. Habier et al. [] showed by simulation that a large part of the accuracy of genomic prediction was due to genetic relationships captured by markers. Recent studies in a sheep population have demonstrated that markers on a single chromosome could capture up to 86% of the accuracy of genomic prediction that was achieved when using all markers []. These results support the fact that most of the accuracy of genomic prediction comes from tracing genetic relationships between individuals. Genetic gain from LD information is expected to increase if the disequilibrium between markers and QTL is stronger. An alternative to using individual markers for prediction is to construct haplotypes based on several markers surrounding a QTL. The probability for a QTL to be in strong LD is higher with a haplotype of markers than with an individual marker []. A drawback of using haplotypes instead of individual markers in genomic prediction is that many more effects need to be predicted. When the number of covariates increases  the amount of data available for each covariate decreases and consequently the accuracy of the predicted covariate effects is reduced. However  several simulation studies have shown that using haplotypes instead of individual markers increases the accuracy of genomic prediction [–]. To date  only a few studies have investigated the use of haplotypes for genomic prediction in real data [  ]. Boichard et al. [] focused on SNP haplotypes related to QTL with large or moderate effects in French dairy cattle. De Roos et al. [] used ancestral haplotypes for genomic prediction in a Holstein population. Several methods are available to construct marker haplotypes. Some are simple  e.g. grouping SNP based on counts of markers [] or fixed lengths of chromosome segments. Other methods use more complicated algorithms to group SNP and cluster the resulting haplotypes. Calus et al. [  ] used an identity by descent (IBD) matrix to group markers and construct haplotypes  and then applied different IBD probability thresholds to cluster similar haplotypes. In this method  the number of haplotype effects to be estimated depended on the IBD probability threshold and on the number of markers included in each haplotype. A lower IBD threshold and more markers per haplotype reduced the number of haplotype effects to be predicted. Here  we used local genealogies to construct haplotypes and to define haplotype clusters. At each point in the genome  extant haplotypes are related in a genealogical tree that ultimately leads back to a common ancestor. Any mutations that are currently segregating in the population necessarily must have occurred at the position of the mutation at some point in the local genealogy  i.e. it must have happened on an edge of a local genealogy []. Given perfect reconstruction of the local genealogy  haplotypes that carry alternative causative polymorphisms will be perfectly clustered by splitting at the edge where the mutation occurred. Thus  for a bi-allelic causative polymorphism  local genealogy haplotype clustering should yield the optimal clusters of haplotypes. However  whether this clustering is optimal or not  also depends strongly on the accuracy of the reconstructed local genealogies. Two classes of prediction models have been used to estimate haplotype effects. One class of models assumes that effects of all haplotypes have the same distribution  e.g. GBLUP or random regression BLUP (RR-BLUP). The other class of models are mixture models  like BayesB or BayesC  which assume that a large proportion of haplotypes have zero effect  while a small proportion have non-zero effects. These models select the most informative haplotypes for genomic prediction and capture LD information better than the GBLUP models []. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy and bias of genomic prediction using haplotypes based on local genealogy information in a Danish Holstein cattle population  applying GBLUP  BayesB and BayesC prediction models. A mixture of versions 1 and 2 of the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip [] was used to genotype 4429 Danish Holstein bulls born between 1974 and 2006. Data for SNP with a minor allele frequency less than 0.01  with no valid chromosome position in the UMD3.1 assembly []  an average GC score less than 0.15  and SNP on the sex chromosomes were removed from the dataset. After editing  43 503 markers remained across 29 autosomes. Response variables in the genomic prediction models were deregressed EBV [  ]. Detailed descriptions of deregressed EBV (DRE) for three index traits  fertility  protein yield and mastitis  are provided in Table<U+2009>. More information on the EBV of index traits is available from the Danish Cattle federation []. Reliabilities of the DRE depend on the heritability (h) of the trait and the effective daughter contribution (EDC) of individuals and was calculated as   where k<U+2009>=<U+2009>(4<U+2009>-<U+2009>h)/h. Marker and haplotype-based predictions were performed and their results were compared. Haplotype-based predictions used genealogically related haplotypes that were clustered together. Genealogical relationships between haplotypes were estimated based on local genealogies. Marker data were phased and imputed with Beagle 3.3 []. First  Beagle constructed haplotypes with default parameter values for scale<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.0 and shift<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2. Then  conditional on the inferred haplotypes  all missing genotypes were imputed using Beagle’s hidden Markov model. After obtaining the phased and imputed data for each individual  local genealogical trees were constructed using the Blossoc software []. In Blossoc  a genealogy is represented as a single rooted binary tree topology  which is constructed around each marker. The procedure was as follows: first  the four-gamete rule was used to find the largest segment around each marker that does not require recombination to be inferred. Assuming an infinite sites model  if all the four possible haplotypes of two markers are observed (00  01  10 and 11)  a single genealogy that does not incorporate recombination can be reconstructed []. For each marker  Blossoc considers the region around that marker that includes as many markers as possible without violation of the four-gamete rule. Then  an unrooted genealogy was reconstructed for this region. The root of this local genealogy tree was on the branch of the tree where the mutation for the current marker occurred. An example of construction of the tree and graphical representations of the tree can be found in [] and []. Haplotypes were clustered based on the reconstructed genealogy. Local genealogical trees contain many levels but only the first three levels were considered  because as the number of levels increases  the frequency number of haplotypes per cluster decreases and this could lead to numerical instability. The first level consisted of the root marker. The second level had two nodes and the third level four nodes. Each node had two branches and every branch below the third level was considered as one cluster. After constructing the tree  there was a maximum of eight clusters of haplotypes per tree. This process was repeated for all markers in the dataset. Each individual had two haplotypes (one maternal and one paternal) in each genealogy and each haplotype belonged to exactly one of the eight clusters. Thus  each individual possessed 0  1 or 2 copies of each haplotype. In haplotype-based prediction  these numbers replace the marker allele counts in genomic prediction. One non-Bayesian method  i.e. GBLUP and four Bayesian methods  i.e. BayesB  BayesBp  BayesC and BayesCp  were used to predict direct genomic values (DGV). Prediction was done using individual markers or haplotypes as covariates and resulting predictions were compared. In BayesB []  each covariate had its own variance with a scaled inverse chi-square prior []. The proportion of covariates with zero effect  p  was set to 0.99. BayesC also fitted data using a mixture distribution of marker effects  with effects equal to zero with probability p but an effect that is sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and a variance parameter that is shared for all markers with non-zero effects with probability 1-p. This common variance is treated as unknown and has a scaled inverse-chi square prior with 4.2 degrees of freedom and the same scale as derived for BayesB. More details are available in []. For comparison  BayesC was fitted with p fixed at 0.99 and 0.999. BayesCp is similar to BayesC. However  in contrast to BayesC  p was treated as an unknown parameter with a uniform (0 1) prior distribution. The actual value was sampled conditional on the data as part of the Gibbs sampler. The posterior mean of p from BayesCp was also used as the fixed value in BayesB  which will be referred to as BayesBp. The general Bayesian statistical model was: where  is the vector of DRE   a vector of 1s   the overall mean   the number of covariates   an N<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector of genotypes at SNP  with individual marker-based prediction and the number of haplotype copies for each animal in covariate  with haplotype-based prediction  a a covariate effect   with  (with probability 1 - p) or a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (with probability p)   a vector of residual effects and .  is a diagonal matrix with element d<U+2009>=<U+2009>1/w  where w is a weighting factor for the i DRE. The weighting factor  w<U+2009>=<U+2009>reliability of DRE/(1-reliability of DRE)  was applied to account for heterogeneous residual variances due to different reliabilities of DRE. To avoid possible problems caused by extremely high weights  reliabilities larger than 0.98 were replaced by 0.98 in the calculation of weights. Details concerning the estimation of  are described in Habier et al. []. All analyses were carried out using the GenSel software []. The Gibbs sampler was run as a single chain with a length of 10 000 samples  of which the first 1000 samples were discarded as burn-in. DGV were estimated as the posterior mean of the sum of a from the remaining 9000 samples. A Gibbs sampler with a longer chain and burn-in (50 000 samples and 20 000 as burn-in) was tested and produced the same results. Convergence of estimated parameters was visually examined and a chain of 10 000 samples was found to be sufficient. The GBLUP model [  ] was: where  is the vector of DRE   a vector of 1s   the overall mean   the design matrix of SNP genotypes or haplotypes covariates associating  with response variables   the vector of covariate effects with   where  is the additive genetic variance   the realized genomic relationship matrix and  the vector of random residuals with .  was the same as in the Bayesian method. Details of the model and construction of the  matrix are in []. When using haplotypes to construct   the matrix () that links haplotypes to individuals and its number of columns is equal to the number of haplotype covariates. The element in row  and column  of this matrix was equal to 0  1 or 2  corresponding to the number of copies of haplotypes  in individual . Then  matrix  was calculated in the same way as with use of marker genotypes. Based on the present data  the two  matrices built using either marker genotypes or haplotypes were very similar. The correlation coefficient between the two  matrices was 0.995 for the diagonal elements and 0.944 for the off-diagonal elements. The GBLUP analyses were performed using the DMU package []. The predictive ability of each model was assessed using a validation procedure in which the whole dataset was divided into two parts: 3084 Holstein animals born before October 1 2001 constituted the reference population and 1333 animals born after that date  the test population. Because not all genotyped animals had DRE for all three traits  the number of animals in the reference and test datasets differed between traits (Table<U+2009>). Accuracies of genomic predictions were measured as the correlation between DRE and DGV divided by the square root of the average reliability of DRE for animals in the test population []. Bias of genomic predictions was assessed by examining the regression of DRE on DGV in the test population. The standard errors of the regression coefficients and accuracies were calculated using R (v. 2.15) (). After editing  the dataset contained 43 503 markers. Construction and cutting of local genealogies produced 326 055 haplotype covariates. The total number of covariates divided by the total number of markers was around 7.5  i.e. less than 8 covariates per marker  since some local genealogies were very unbalanced with some branches empty. Not all markers had a complete tree. A tree was complete when all the nodes in the three levels had two branches such that there were eight clusters of haplotypes in the bottom of the tree to use for prediction. Accuracies of DGV and their standard errors in the test population using different prediction methods with individual markers and haplotypes as predictors are shown in Table<U+2009>  along with the posterior mean of p from the BayesCp method. For all three traits  the lowest accuracies were obtained for BayesC when p was fixed at 0.999 for both individual marker-based and haplotype-based prediction. The prediction method yielding the highest accuracy differed between traits: BayesBp had the highest accuracy for protein yield  BayesCp for mastitis and GBLUP for fertility when individual marker prediction was used. The number of covariates was larger with haplotype-based prediction than with individual marker-based prediction. Except for the BayesC model with p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999  accuracies from different prediction methods using haplotypes were similar but the highest accuracies were obtained for different traits with different methods i.e. for protein yield with BayesCp  for mastitis with BayesBp and for fertility with BayesC and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99. With both individual marker-based and haplotype-based prediction  BayesCp had the highest or close to the highest accuracy for all traits. The posterior means of p were similar with individual marker-based and haplotype-based predictions for mastitis and fertility  but increased from 0.91 to 0.97 with haplotype-based prediction for protein yield. The regression coefficients of DRE on DGV and their standard errors for individual marker-based and haplotype-based prediction in the test population are shown in Table<U+2009>. All the regression values were less than 1  indicating that the variance of the DGV was over-predicted to some extent. This means that positive values of DGV over-predict DRE and negative DGV values under-predict DRE. BayesC with p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999 had the largest deviation from 1  i.e. the DGV obtained with this model were the most biased. GBLUP led to the lowest bias for protein yield and fertility for both individual marker-based and haplotype-based prediction and the second lowest bias for mastitis. BayesBp produced the least biased DGV for mastitis. The lowest standard error of the regression coefficient was observed for protein yield  followed by mastitis and fertility. As shown in Table<U+2009>  in most cases the regression coefficients were closer to 1 with haplotype-based prediction than with individual marker-based prediction. The only exception was BayesBp for fertility. Use of genealogy-based haplotypes instead of individual marker genotypes had an effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction. Simulation studies have shown that using SNP haplotypes improves the accuracy of genomic prediction [–]. Different methods and different numbers of markers per haplotype have been used to construct and cluster haplotypes. Although there are many simulation studies on genomic prediction using haplotypes  studies based on real data in dairy cattle are limited. This study investigated the accuracy and bias of DGV derived using local genealogy haplotypes in the Danish Holstein population genotyped with the 50 K SNP chip. In our study  the haplotype-based prediction approach slightly increased the accuracy of DGV compared to individual marker-based genomic prediction in some cases. The biggest gain in accuracy was achieved for protein yield  followed by mastitis. A previous study reported increased accuracy of DGV using a model with selected haplotypes and polygenic effects in French dairy cattle []. There could be several reasons why  in our study  only small increases in the accuracy of DGV were obtained when using haplotype-based prediction. First  local genealogies were used to cluster haplotypes. The true genealogy is unknown and must be inferred. There is a trade-off between accuracy and computing time when inferring the genealogy. The Blossoc method aims at achieving computing efficiency []. Overall  it took 15<U+2009>h to construct genealogy trees for 43 503 markers and 4429 animals with a server with 2.93<U+2009>GHz CPU and 48<U+2009>GB RAM. Reconstructing local genealogies more accurately could further increase the accuracy of DGV. Another reason for the small increases in accuracy from using haplotypes could be that the tree was cut at the third level to avoid numerical problem. Cutting the tree at deeper levels (e.g. fourth or fifth level) would produce more haplotype clusters and thus haplotypes could be clustered more accurately. However  this would also reduce the number of individuals with data for each cluster and reduce the accuracy of the estimated effects of the haplotypes. In our study  given the size of the available population  cutting at the third level was assumed to be optimal. In cases with larger populations  cutting at lower levels might be considered. In general  two sources of information can influence the accuracy of genomic prediction i.e. (1) LD between markers and QTL and (2) genetic relationships between individuals that are captured by markers. The initial assumption was that most of the accuracy of genomic prediction arises from LD []. Capturing more LD will increase the accuracy of genomic prediction  which was the main idea of using haplotypes. However  several recent studies suggest that a large part of the accuracy of genomic prediction is derived from reconstruction of genetic relationships rather than from close LD between markers and QTL. Daetwyler et al. [] using data from a sheep population showed that markers from a single chromosome captured 86% of the accuracy of genomic predictions using all markers on the ovine 50 K SNP chip []. These results indicate that there is a small opportunity to improve genomic prediction by capturing more LD information. Thus  constructing haplotypes from SNP markers is not expected to greatly increase the accuracy of genomic prediction. Bias of genomic predictions was assessed by the regression coefficient of DRE on DGV in the test population (Table<U+2009>). Regression coefficients were less than 1 for all traits considered and all models applied. This shows an inflation of genomic predictions. Haplotype-based prediction led to less bias than individual marker-based prediction. Two classes of prediction models were applied in our study: GBLUP  with the effects of all covariates following the same distribution  and Bayesian methods  in which a high proportion of covariates had zero effect (p) and a small proportion had moderate to large effects. With GBLUP  haplotype-based prediction fitted around 7.5 times more covariate effects but with only a small gain in accuracy for protein and mastitis traits  compared with individual marker-based prediction. With the Bayesian methods  p had a strong effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction when using individual markers. Forcing a higher proportion of covariates (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99) to have zero effect decreased the accuracy of DGV when using individual markers but had less influence when using haplotypes. In methods like BayesB  p is usually fixed before the analysis and finding the most appropriate p is challenging. With haplotype-based prediction  DGV accuracies were less influenced by the value of p. Thus  the challenge consisting in finding the most appropriate p value can be relaxed when using the haplotype-based approach. The accuracy of haplotype-based prediction decreased when a very high proportion of haplotype covariates were forced to have zero effect (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999). Loss of accuracy by shrinking a high proportion of the predictor effects to zero indicates that predictors with real predictive power are being removed from the model. For protein yield  using the Bayesian haplotype-based model led to a larger posterior mean of the fraction (p) of predictors whose effects were set to 0  compared to the individual marker-based model. This was not the case for fertility or mastitis. Assuming that the major source of information in genomic prediction is reconstruction of relationship and noting that this marker-based reconstruction of relationships is shared by the three traits  we would have expected the same result for all the three traits. Because we see differences in behaviour between the three traits  these effects cannot be due to reconstruction of relationships but there must be differences between the traits in their genetic basis and in the LD relationship of QTL with markers versus haplotypes used as predictors. The fact that fewer non-zero effects are needed (higher p) for protein is consistent with the assumption that fewer factors influence protein yield than mastitis and fertility. Therefore  a relatively low number of haplotypes is sufficient to describe the inheritance of these factors for protein yield. More covariates in the prediction models increase the computing times. With GBLUP  more time was needed to construct the  matrix with the haplotype-based prediction (20<U+2009>min) than with the individual marker-based prediction (5<U+2009>min)  but the time required to obtain predictions was similar for the two prediction methods (~40<U+2009>min) since the dimension of the  matrix was the same. For the Bayesian models  however  time to obtain predictions increased from 32<U+2009>min when using individual markers to 3<U+2009>hours and 20<U+2009>min when using haplotypes. Accuracy of genomic prediction can be slightly improved and bias of prediction can be reduced by using haplotypes based on local genealogy information. The proportion of covariates with zero effects (p) has a large influence on the accuracy of genomic prediction when using Bayesian mixture models but haplotype-based prediction is less sensitive to p than individual marker-based prediction.

Genotyping key animals at high density and subsequent population-based genotype imputation yield high imputation accuracy. Pre-phasing the genotypes of the reference and validation populations is computationally efficient and results in high imputation accuracy  even when the reference population is small. With the availability of dense marker panels  assessing the genetic value of individuals without relying on phenotypic information is possible []. Current routine genomic evaluation of cattle populations is performed using the genotypes of ~54 000 SNP. However  the most recent high-density genotyping arrays facilitate the high-throughput interrogation of 648 874 and 777 962 SNP  respectively []. Using densely spaced marker maps increases the probability of co-segregation of SNP and quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) []. Since both genomic predictions and genome-wide association studies exploit linkage disequilibrium (LD) between anonymous markers and QTN  increasing the density of SNP maps is likely to improve the capacities of genome-wide population analyses [–]. However  the relationship between validation and calibration populations is crucial to obtain accurate genomic predictions []. Genotype imputation is invaluable to combine different marker panels and to infer missing genotypes []. Imputation of genotypes makes it possible to extrapolate genotypes from lower to higher density arrays based on a representative sample of individuals genotyped at high-density. Different approaches for imputation of genotypes exploit pedigree information []  population-wide LD (.. [  ]) or both sources of information (.. []). The accuracy of genotype imputation depends on the proportion of missing genotypes [] and the number of individuals and relatives genotyped at high-density [  ]. However  the number of reference genotypes required to ensure high imputation quality varies across populations and depends mainly on the effective population size []. Careful selection of animals for high-density genotyping facilitates population-wide imputation of high-quality genotypes while minimizing genotyping costs [  ]. Here  we report the evaluation of four tools for imputation of genotypes in 797 Fleckvieh (FV) bulls genotyped with 639 214 SNP. We show that imputation based on pre-phasing results in high accuracy and is computationally efficient. As few as 100 informative reference animals were sufficient to genotype the entire population with high accuracy. A total of 814 bulls of the FV bovine breed were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip including genotypes of 777 962 SNP. The animals were born between 1970 and 2007 with 90.2% born between 1997 and 2004 (see Additional file ). The bulls descended from 209 sires and 223 maternal grand-sires. The paternal half-sib and maternal grand-sire families comprised up to 27 and 46 members with an average of 3.9 and 3.2 members  respectively. Genotype calling was performed using the default parameters of Illumina's . The chromosomal position of the SNP was determined based on the UMD3.1 assembly of the bovine genome []. We excluded 1224 Y-chromosome  343 mitochondrial and 1735 SNP with an unknown chromosomal position from further analysis. One SNP out of 55 pairs of SNP with identical chromosomal positions but different SNP-ids (duplicates) was omitted. Eight bulls were excluded because genotyping failed for more than 5% of the SNP. We omitted 10 751 SNP because genotyping failed in more than 5% of the individuals  124 652 SNP that had a minor allele frequency (MAF)<U+2009><<U+2009>1% and 4024 SNP with a significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>10) deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Pedigree-based relationships among the animals were obtained using []  tracing pedigree information back to 1920. Comparing the pedigree and the realized genomic relationships [] led to the exclusion of nine animals showing major discrepancies (see Additional file ). Genotypes of 228 sire-offspring pairs were inspected for mendelian errors (.. genotype AA and BB in sire and offspring  respectively). The number of mendelian errors ranged from 24 to 132  with an average of 63 errors per pair. Genotypes of both sire and offspring were set to missing for SNP with mendelian errors. The final data set comprised 797 animals and 639 214 SNP  with an average call-rate of 99.48% per individual. The high-density data set was divided into a reference and a validation population. Complete genotype information was retained for animals in the reference population  whereas genotypes were set to missing for animals in the validation population for all SNP except those included in the BovineSNP50 Bead chip (version 2). SNP that are present in the BovineSNP50 Bead chip but not in the BovineHD Bead chip were not considered. Subsequently  genotype imputation was performed to infer the masked genotypes . Imputation accuracy was assessed by comparing the imputed genotypes/alleles with the true genotypes/alleles and by calculating the correlation between true and imputed genotypes (r) []. The SNP-specific imputation accuracy was assessed as a function of allele frequencies. Allele frequencies and the corresponding proportion of correctly imputed alleles were fitted with a local regression model (LOESS)  with a smoothing factor of 0.1. The individual-specific imputation accuracy was calculated as a function of the number of relatives in the reference population. The relationship was obtained from the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix (see above). Imputation accuracy was evaluated for four scenarios with an increasing number of reference animals. Animals for the reference population were selected based on []  where  is a subset of the numerator relationship matrix   is a vector representing the average relationship of m selected animals with the entire population and  is a vector of the proportion of the gene pool captured by the m animals. Out of 797 animals with high-density genotypes  the most informative 50  100  200 and 400 animals were iteratively chosen to maximise   .. the most informative 50 animals were a subset of the most informative 100 animals . Such subsets of animals capture the greatest proportion of the gene pool of the entire dataset and should provide the most accurate genotype imputation. Animals identified in this way were considered as reference individuals. The remaining 747  697  597 and 397 animals were used as validation individuals. Imputation accuracy was also assessed using randomly selected reference animals. Fifty animals were randomly selected as reference individuals and the remaining 747 animals were used as validation individuals. The random selection of reference animals and subsequent genotype imputation and validation were repeated ten times. The performance of four imputation tools was evaluated. Three population-based imputation algorithms ( (version 3.2.1) []   (version 1.0.16.a) []  []) exploiting LD were applied without considering pedigree information. Additionally  the performance of an algorithm based on long-range phasing implemented in . (version 2) []  combining both family and population-based imputation  was evaluated.  and  were applied since these algorithms provide high imputation accuracy in both livestock and human populations [  ].  and  are imputation algorithms based on a hidden Markov model (HMM).  performs a local clustering of haplotypes at each marker position to define the hidden states whereas  samples pairs of known haplotypes for each individual based on the observed genotypes in each round of the HMM. A detailed review of the implemented algorithms is given in [].  is time consuming  especially for large reference populations []. Thus  we also evaluated   a computationally efficient “pre-phasing”-based implementation of the  algorithm  taking haplotypes as input for both the reference and the validation populations. Therefore  haplotypes for the reference and validation populations were inferred using  and subsequent haplotype-based imputation of missing genotypes was performed with . While    and  provide allele dosage data (.. continuously distributed values ranging from 0 to 2)  . provides discrete genotypes only (.. 0 1 2). For the present study  discrete genotypes were analysed and missing alleles resulting from imputation with . were subsequently imputed based on allele frequencies. All programs were run on an Intel Xeon 2.13 Ghz processor using recommended parameters. A detailed overview of the parameters applied with the different tools is given in Additional file . Genome-wide analysis of imputation accuracy detected regions of poor imputation quality  most likely because of misplacement of SNP. The chromosomes were partitioned into segments of 0.5 Mb. The segments were inspected for SNP with more than 10% incorrectly imputed genotypes. If more than ten SNP with more than 10% of incorrectly imputed genotypes were located within a segment  all the SNP within this segment were considered as misplaced. If less than ten SNP per segment had more than 10% incorrectly imputed genotypes  only the erroneously imputed SNP were considered as misplaced. Genotypes for animals of the validation population were imputed based on an increasing number of highly informative reference animals with high-density genotypes. 78.03% of the genes/haplotypes of the 797 studied animals could be traced back to the subset of the 50 most informative reference animals. This fraction increased to 89.21%  97.47% and<U+2009>><U+2009>99% for the scenarios including 100  200 and 400 reference animals. Most of the 797 animals (90.2%) were born between 1997 and 2004 (see Additional file ) and the number of sire-offspring pairs was low (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>228). Within the subset of the 50 most informative animals  the majority (56%) was born before 1997. These animals can be considered as the ancestors of the studied population. Most validation animals had no first-degree relatives in the reference population (Table ). The fraction of validation animals without relatives with a pedigree relationship greater than 0.25 was 18.07% (135 of 747) and 3.78% (15 of 397) in the scenarios including 50 and 400 reference animals  respectively. However  the average number of related reference animals was very small for the validation animals across all scenarios (Table ). Imputation of genotypes was performed separately for six chromosomes (Table ). The number of masked and subsequently imputed high-density genotypes ranged from 93.44% (BTA1) to 94.41% (BTA5). The validation populations contained no missing genotypes after imputation with    and . However  6.49%  1.46%  0.26% and 0.11% of the masked genotypes remained missing after imputation with . for the scenarios including 50  100  200 and 400 reference animals  respectively. Those genotypes were subsequently imputed based on allele frequencies. The imputation accuracy increased as the size of the reference population increased (Figure ). However  the correlation between true and imputed genotypes (r) varied considerably across chromosomes  especially for the scenario including 50 reference animals. With   the correlation ranged from 0.825 (BTA25) to 0.896 (BTA1) and with . it ranged from 0.793 (BTA25) to 0.899 (BTA2).  and  provided nearly identical imputation quality  although computational time was considerably lower with  (Table ). Phasing both the reference and validation populations with  and subsequent haplotype-based genotype imputation with  outperformed all other approaches  especially when the number of reference animals was small. Imputation with  yielded an r value of 0.953 with 50 reference animals  while with    and . r was only 0.945  0.858 and 0.865  respectively (Table ). Increasing the number of reference animals to 100  200 and 400 yielded an r value of 0.977  0.989 and 0.993 with .  Barplots indicate the correlation between true and imputed genotypes (r) averaged over six chromosomes for an increasing reference population size. The black lines represent the minimum and maximum imputation accuracy for the six chromosomes. The approach based on pre-phasing implemented in  not only provided highly accurate imputed genotypes but was also computationally efficient (Table ). However  . was the most efficient computationally  especially for a large number of reference genotypes. The proportion of correctly imputed alleles was ~98.5% for  and   for the scenario with 100 reference animals (Table ). The corresponding r was<U+2009>><U+2009>0.975.  and  clearly outperformed  and . in all scenarios and provided the most accurate results for rare alleles. Imputation quality for rare alleles was very poor with . (Figure ). All algorithms inferred frequent alleles with high quality even when the number of reference animals was small.  The proportion of correctly imputed alleles is displayed as a function of allele frequencies for . (light grey)   (dark grey)   (blue) and  (light blue) for an increasing reference population size. The curves were obtained by fitting a nonparametric local regression (LOESS). The quality of the imputed genotypes varied considerably between animals (Figure A). The extent of genotype information from relatives in the reference population was the major determinant of the individual imputation accuracy. For the scenario with 50 reference animals  most validation animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>621) had no first-degree relatives in the reference population (Table ). We considered that reference and validation animals are close relatives if their relationship was above 0.12. While r was<U+2009><<U+2009>0.90 for all algorithms without including high-density genotype information from closely related animals  the imputation accuracy increased considerably as the number of relatives in the reference population increased (Figure B).  and  provided highly accurate genotypes  even if the number of relatives in the reference population was small. With  and   the average r exceeded 0.94 for validation animals which had at least one related animal with r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.12 in the reference population. The accuracy of . increased considerably as the number of relatives in the reference population increased. With   r never exceeded 0.885 for the scenario with 50 reference animals.  Barplots indicate the correlation between true and imputed genotypes (r) for 747 animals based on 50 reference animals (). The individual r increased considerably as the number of close relatives increased (coefficient of relationship >0.12) in the reference population (). The impact of genotype information from relatives decreased as the size of the reference population increased when applying the population-based imputation tools    and . In contrast  the quality of the imputed genotypes obtained with . increased considerably as the number of relatives increased  even for the scenario with 400 reference animals (see Additional file ). Ten subsets of 50 randomly selected animals that explained between 68.9% and 71.9% of the gene pool of the entire data set were used as reference populations to impute genotypes for 747 validation animals on chromosome 20. The imputation accuracy obtained based on these randomly selected reference animals was lower compared with r obtained using the most informative animals as reference individuals across all replications for the four imputation tools (Table ). Using the most informative instead of random animals as reference population increased r especially for . (0.876 . 0.837). However   and  provided high imputation accuracy even with randomly selected reference populations.  was used for genome-wide imputation of high-density genotypes. Of 639 214 SNP  39 679 SNP were retained for 397 validation animals  while genotypes for the remaining 599 535 SNP were imputed using 400 reference animals. With this design r was equal to 0.993 across six analysed chromosomes (Table ). The genome-wide distribution of the imputation accuracy revealed genomic regions with poor imputation quality (Figure ). Analysis of these regions showed that misplacement of SNP increased the fraction of poorly imputed genotypes. Poor imputation quality along entire chromosomal segments results from intra-chromosomal misplacement of adjacent SNP. However  analysis of LD also indicated inter-chromosomal misplacement of individual SNP (see Additional file ). A total of 5039 out of 599 535 SNP (0.84%) was identified as probably misplaced using this procedure. - Genotypes of 599 535 SNP were imputed for 397 animals based on haplotype information of 400 reference animals using . Blue dots represent 5039 SNP within regions of poor imputation quality probably representing misplaced SNP. Four imputation tools were evaluated using a data set consisting of 797 bulls of the German FV population genotyped at 639 214 SNP. The reference animals were selected to capture the greatest proportion of the gene pool of the genotyped population. Using   up to 97.1% of the alleles were correctly imputed based on 50 pre-selected reference animals. Imputation accuracy based on genotypes of randomly selected reference animals was slightly  albeit consistently lower (Table ). Brøndum et al. [] used  to impute high-density genotypes in three cattle breeds based on ~200 reference animals and obtained r ranging from 0.925 to 0.973. In our study   yielded an r of 0.977 with 200 pre-selected reference animals. In the Holstein-Friesian breed  Erbe et al. [] obtained 97.7% of correctly imputed genotypes with  using ~400 randomly selected reference animals. In our study  using  with 400 pre-selected animals as reference population yielded 98.7% of correctly imputed genotypes. However   and  yielded the same imputation accuracy with 200 reference animals only. Selecting highly informative reference animals (.. key animals) maximises the proportion of genes/haplotypes in the validation population that can be traced back to these key animals and thus maximises imputation accuracy while minimizing genotyping costs [    ]. Our findings demonstrate that pre-selecting highly-informative reference animals is slightly beneficial for subsequent genotype imputation. The most influential animals have been identified in various cattle populations [  ] and such 'key animals' will be used for whole-genome re-sequencing. Simulations have shown that imputation of sequence information from a restricted number of highly informative individuals is feasible []. Genotyping a large number of animals at high-density and subsequently imputing the whole-genome sequence information from a small number of carefully selected 'key animals' might lead to even higher accuracy  since imputation quality strongly depends on the marker density in both reference and validation populations [    ]. However  our findings also show that the choice of a suitable imputation algorithm is more crucial than the selection of 'key animals' to obtain high imputation accuracy based on a small number of reference animals. Imputation accuracy increased as the size of the reference population increased  which agrees with [    ]. However  the performance of imputation tools varied considerably  especially when the number of animals and relatives with high-density genotypes was limited.  and  provided highly accurate imputed genotypes  even with only 50 reference animals compared to  and .. This advantage of  and  for genotype imputation based on a small reference population agrees with the reports of Browning and Browning [] and Pei et al. []. If the size of the reference population increases  the accuracies of the imputation tools converge  which agrees with findings of Browning and Browning []. For the scenarios with 50 and 100 reference animals  the approach based on pre-phasing and implemented with  provided the most accurate genotypes.  was run after phasing both reference and validation populations with   disregarding pedigree information. Accounting for pedigree information might further improve the quality of phasing and thus the accuracy of subsequent genotype imputation [    ]. In our study  the number of validation animals with close relatives in the reference population was very small. Thus  we found no increase in imputation accuracy with .. However  if the number of closely related reference animals is increased  imputation algorithms using both pedigree and population information are likely to outperform tools using population information only []. The pre-phasing approach applied in the present study is preferable when the number of related reference animals is small. Besides allowing for a high imputation accuracy  imputation approaches based on pre-phasing are computationally efficient. The reference genotypes need to be phased only once and the phasing step can be separated from the actual imputation step [  ]. This restricts the computational burden of genotype imputation in routine implementations such as genomic prediction. Previous studies have shown that long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation provide accurately imputed genotypes in livestock populations at a low computational input when the reference population is large [  –]. Our results indicate that pre-phasing might slightly increase imputation accuracy  particularly when the number of reference genotypes is limited. The benefit of pre-phasing is expected to result from capturing LD effects at a better resolution []. Thus  pre-phasing based approaches might become the method of choice to impute the entire sequence information based on the re-sequencing of a limited number of key genomes in livestock populations. Two population-based approaches that exploit LD without explicitly considering pedigree information (  ) outperformed . that takes relationships into account. . was specifically designed to impute genotypes using large data sets and exploiting comprehensive pedigree information []. In contrast  our data set comprised 797 animals only  mainly born between 1997 and 2004. Furthermore  the number of genotyped relatives in the reference population was very small for most of the animals in the validation population  resulting in comparably low overall imputation accuracy when using .. However  imputation with . provided<U+2009>><U+2009>98% of correctly imputed genotypes when a substantial number of the relatives with genotypes was present in the reference population (see Additional file ). This agrees with findings for the American Holstein-Friesian population []. However  comparing imputation accuracy across studies and breeds is difficult since data sets and population-specific parameters (.. LD  effective population size (N)) might differ substantially. While recent N estimates for the Holstein-Friesian population range from<U+2009><<U+2009>100 to 114 [    ]  N for the FV population is considerably higher (see Additional file ). Low LD  which is typical for populations with large N[]  complicates genotype imputation considerably []. However  in populations with small N (.. Jersey cattle [])  genotype imputation based on a small number of carefully selected reference animals yields a reasonable accuracy []. Our results demonstrate that genotyping at least 100 pre-selected animals at high density and subsequently applying population-based imputation yielded highly reliable genotypes for the analysed subset of the FV population  although N is comparatively large. However  the animals in our study are highly selected artificial insemination bulls and might not fully reflect the haplotype diversity of the entire FV population. Genome-wide analysis of imputation accuracy also allowed misplaced SNP to be identified. Although misplaced SNP are particularly obstructive for haplotype-based analyses (.. identification of selective sweeps) []  the position of significantly associated SNP in genome-wide association studies should also be validated to avoid misinterpretations. Analysis of genomic regions with poor imputation quality revealed 5039 SNP that are most likely misplaced. Recently  Erbe et al. [] showed similar results. The total number of misplaced SNP might be even higher  since SNP with very low MAF (< 1%) were excluded for the evaluation of imputation accuracy. Furthermore  our procedure is not suitable to reveal misplaced SNP within short distances. However  the proportion of misplaced SNP in the high-density array used here is slightly higher than in the BovineSNP50 Bead chip []  which is most likely due to a better resolution of the high-density marker map. The number of misplaced SNP detected here is considerably higher than reported by Fadista and Bendixen []  who relied on a more precise assembly of the reference sequence. However  LD-based procedures make it possible to realign SNP positions despite imperfectly assembled reference genomes. Genotype imputation allows different marker panels to be combined and missing genotypes to be infered . The quality of the imputed genotypes strongly depends on the amount of genotype information that is available from relatives. However  population-based imputation tools provide highly-reliable genotypes even if the number of reference animals is small. In addition  imputation accuracy increases if the animals of the reference panel are chosen to maximally contribute to the gene pool of the imputation population. Pre-phasing the genotypes of both the reference and validation populations not only results in highly accurately imputed genotypes but is also computationally efficient.

In this work  we investigated their ancestral sheep populations from Iron Age  Medieval and Post-Medieval periods by sequencing a partial mitochondrial DNA D-loop and the 5’-promoter region of the  gene. We compared the maternal (mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) and paternal (SNP  1) genetic diversity of ancient sheep in Finland with modern domestic sheep populations in Europe and Asia to study temporal changes in genetic variation and affinities between ancient and modern populations.ResultsA 523-bp mitochondrial DNA sequence was successfully amplified for 26 of 36 sheep ancient samples i.e. five  seven and 14 samples representative of Iron Age  Medieval and Post-Medieval sheep  respectively. Genetic diversity was analyzed within the cohorts. This ancient dataset was compared with present-day data consisting of 94 animals from 10 contemporary European breeds and with GenBank DNA sequence data to carry out a haplotype sharing analysis. Among the 18 ancient mitochondrial DNA haplotypes identified  14 were present in the modern breeds. Ancient haplotypes were assigned to the highly divergent ovine haplogroups A and B  haplogroup B being the major lineage within the cohorts. Only two haplotypes were detected in the Iron Age samples  while the genetic diversity of the Medieval and Post-Medieval cohorts was higher. For three of the ancient DNA samples  Y-chromosome  gene sequences were amplified indicating that they originated from rams. The  gene of these three ancient ram samples contained SNP G- 1  which is frequent in modern north-European sheep breeds.ConclusionsOur study did not reveal any sign of major population replacement of native sheep in Finland since the Iron Age.

In this work  we investigated their ancestral sheep populations from Iron Age  Medieval and Post-Medieval periods by sequencing a partial mitochondrial DNA D-loop and the 5’-promoter region of the  gene. We compared the maternal (mitochondrial DNA haplotypes) and paternal (SNP  1) genetic diversity of ancient sheep in Finland with modern domestic sheep populations in Europe and Asia to study temporal changes in genetic variation and affinities between ancient and modern populations. A 523-bp mitochondrial DNA sequence was successfully amplified for 26 of 36 sheep ancient samples i.e. five  seven and 14 samples representative of Iron Age  Medieval and Post-Medieval sheep  respectively. Genetic diversity was analyzed within the cohorts. This ancient dataset was compared with present-day data consisting of 94 animals from 10 contemporary European breeds and with GenBank DNA sequence data to carry out a haplotype sharing analysis. Among the 18 ancient mitochondrial DNA haplotypes identified  14 were present in the modern breeds. Ancient haplotypes were assigned to the highly divergent ovine haplogroups A and B  haplogroup B being the major lineage within the cohorts. Only two haplotypes were detected in the Iron Age samples  while the genetic diversity of the Medieval and Post-Medieval cohorts was higher. For three of the ancient DNA samples  Y-chromosome  gene sequences were amplified indicating that they originated from rams. The  gene of these three ancient ram samples contained SNP G- 1  which is frequent in modern north-European sheep breeds. Our study did not reveal any sign of major population replacement of native sheep in Finland since the Iron Age. Variations in the availability of archaeological remains may explain differences in genetic diversity estimates and patterns within the cohorts rather than demographic events that occurred in the past. Our ancient DNA results fit well with the genetic context of domestic sheep as determined by analyses of modern north-European sheep breeds. Archaeological and molecular genetic evidence suggests that sheep’s () wild ancestor was the Asiatic mouflon () and that it was domesticated about 11 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region []. The genetic history of the domestication of sheep has been investigated by analysing maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in modern sheep breeds. To date  five phylogenetically divergent mtDNA haplogroups descending probably from several  populations have been identified in domestic sheep [] i.e. haplogroups A and B that are present in sheep in many parts of the world and haplogroups C  D and E that have a much more restricted geographic range [  ]. Sheep spread across Europe in separate migration episodes over time from their domestication site in the Near East []. Chessa et al. [] have provided evidence that contemporary sheep breeds and populations of north-western and northern Europe  e.g. the Finnish native sheep breeds  Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey and Åland still share genetic ancestry with the most primitive type of sheep in Europe descending from the first immigrant wave []. The earliest archeological record for burned sheep bone in Finland dated by radiocarbon is from the late Stone Age (3 679<U+2009>±<U+2009>33 BP  cal 2150–1950 BC; []). However  such archaeological evidence of animal husbandry in Finland is scarce and domesticated animals may have arrived in Finland with the expansion of the Corded Ware culture from the south via the Baltics  but also from the west (Scandinavia) and east (Russia). Available archaeological data indicate that  in Finland  sheep husbandry developed first in fairly limited areas of the southern and south-western regions. The size of the sheep population was then probably quite small and the arrival of any new animals e.g. with immigrants would have had a significant effect on the population’s gene pool. During the Iron Age  agriculture developed in eastern and central Finland until reaching the northern limit of permanent cultivation (ca. 62°N latitude) []. Population size  demography and morphological centeracters of medieval sheep in Finland can be inferred from historical tax registers. For example  in 1620  there were at least 188 300 sheep in Finland []. Foreign “Spanish” sheep (i.e. ancestors of modern Merino sheep) with finer wool were imported into Finland at least from the 16th century onwards to serve the local wool industry []. Exotic breeding material was introduced mainly through imported rams  which means that the admixture may not have shaped the original mtDNA diversity in the Finnish native sheep. However  nuclear marker analysis of modern sheep breeds has shown that imported animals probably had a limited effect on the gene pool of the Finnish sheep population []. The Finnish Sheep Breeding Organization was established in 1918 and breeding of the main native breed  Finnsheep  depended essentially on animals from the eastern part of Finland []. In recent years  several molecular and population genetic studies have focused on the modern Finnish native sheep breeds with analyses of within-population diversity and population structure using mtDNA  Y-chromosome markers  autosomal microsatellites and whole-genome SNP [    –]. It has been shown that the three native Finnish sheep breeds  Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey and Åland and several other North-European native sheep breeds belong to the Nordic group of short tailed sheep [  ]. Two different mtDNA haplogroups  A and B  segregate in the Finnish native sheep and as in other European sheep breeds; haplogroup B is much more frequent than haplogroup A []. In addition  Meadows et al. [] reported that the three different Y-chromosome haplotypes assigned to two different haplogroups were present in Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey and Åland breeds. In this study  we present a new approach to the molecular and population genetics of the Finnish native sheep breeds based on the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) from ancestral populations from the Late Iron Age (800–1200 AD)  Medieval (1200–1550 AD) and Post-Medieval periods (1550–1800 AD). Comparing the genetic diversity of ancient populations with contemporary breeds can reveal temporal genetic changes and gene pool developments  as exemplified in a cattle Y-chromosome study [] and in a mtDNA analysis for inferring the domestication history of European pigs []. However  ancient DNA studies can also reveal relatively minor changes in population diversity patterns. For example  frequencies of the mtDNA haplogroups A and B detected in ancient Chinese sheep populations from the Bronze Age are similar to those in contemporary Chinese sheep breeds [  ]. We investigated the genetic diversity of ancient sheep remains in Finland by sequencing a 523-bp mtDNA D-loop sequence and a 130-bp segment in the 5’-promoter region of the ovine  () gene to detect a biallelic Y-chromosome SNP marker  1. We compared mtDNA and Y-chromosome marker data from ancient and modern domestic sheep populations in Finland and other parts of Europe and Asia and studied temporal changes in maternal and paternal genetic diversity and mtDNA diversity patterns. For the mtDNA study  two modern datasets were used: (1) 10 modern European sheep breeds were sequenced and (2) additional mtDNA sequences were collected from GenBank that spanned the same mtDNA D-loop nucleotide sites as those present in the ancient mtDNA sequences. To our knowledge  this is the first time that mtDNA and Y-chromosome genetic diversities of ancient sheep populations are investigated in the same study. For the aDNA analysis  36 sheep bones were selected from 14 different locations and 18 different archaeological excavations across Finland and one site in northern Norway (Table   Additional file : Figure S1). As a rule  unburned bone from time periods prior to the Late Iron Age is not preserved in the Finnish acid soil; thus earlier bone material consists of small burned fragments that are not useful for aDNA analyses []. The earliest unburned bones available for this study derive from the Late Iron Age (800–1200 AD).  When possible  metacarpal or metatarsal bones were selected for two reasons: (1) these bones are easy to distinguish between sheep and goats and (2) they are often found in a complete or semi-complete state in the excavations because since they are nutritionally poor they were not usually butchered for cooking. However  other bone elements were also sampled  e.g. when metapodials were not present in the sample  or were badly preserved or fragmented  or if they did not form the highest Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) within the excavation or phase. In some cases  only bones that are directly identifiable as from sheep or goat (e.g. teeth) were selected because it is possible to identify a species from analyses of the mtDNA D-loop region. Care was taken not to sample the same individual twice i.e. within one site and phase  elements located on the same side were selected for a given sample  otherwise age and size of the animal were used to separate different individuals. All samples that based on the archaeological context were assumed to originate from the Iron Age or Medieval period were radiocarbon-dated. In addition  Post-Medieval samples for which dating was uncertain from the archaeological context  were also radiocarbon-dated. Nineteen sheep bones or teeth were radiocarbon-dated in the Laboratory of Chronology of the Finnish Museum of Natural History  University of Helsinki (Table ). Eleven samples excavated at four different sites from the Iron Age were included in this study (Table   Additional file : Figure S1). The aDNA samples (sample ID: OaM1-5) belong to the Viking Age phase of the Mulli site (1090–930 BP  Table ). The animal bone assemblage from this site is mainly composed of domestic animals  but also contains a variety of wild mammals. Eastern Finland Viking Age sites were sampled (OaSys1 and OaMik1) and samples from two Iron Age cemetery sites in south-west and southern Finland (OaLui1-2 and OaKir1) were collected. The sample from Brodtkorbneset  Pasvik (Norway) (OaPas1) derives from a rectangular hearth of Sami origin and also dates to the late Iron Age (984<U+2009>±<U+2009>31 BP  Table ). Eleven samples from western and eastern Finland from the Medieval period were analysed (Table   Additional file : Figure S1) among which eight originated from the town of Turku (OaÅA3-6  OaVet1-4)  the largest Medieval town in Finland that is situated on the south-west coast by the river Aura  one from Bridgettine Abbey of Naantali (OaNaa1) situated in south-west Finland ca. 18 km from Turku  one from Kökar monastery  a medieval Franciscan monastery situated in the Åland archipelago (OaKök1)  and one from eastern Finnish Karelia i.e. a deserted Greek Orthodox village in Papinniemi in Uukuniemi (OaUuk2). Fourteen samples from the Post-Medieval period were analysed (Table   Additional file : Figure S1) among which six were collected from the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia  from Pietarsaari (OaPie1)  Tornio (OaTor1-2) and Oulu (OaOul1-3)  seven from south-west and southern Finland i.e. two from Kökar monastery (OaKök2-4)  two from Turku (OaÅA1-2) and two from Helsinki (OaHel1-2)  both in urban contexts and one from an inland region at Pihtipudas (OaPih1). The occurrence of ancient sheep mtDNA sequences in modern sheep breeds was investigated with two datasets: (1) our own dataset of 94 unrelated animals from 10 sheep breeds or local varieties [see Additional file : Figure S1] and (2) a dataset composed of GenBank sequence data of 50 European and Asian sheep breeds previously published. Our own dataset was also used for the comparison between ancient and modern DNA. Previously described in [  ]  breeds included in our own dataset are the following: the Finnish native sheep breeds Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey and Åland  the Viena sheep from Russian Karelia  Bozakh sheep from the Caucasus  Romanov and Oparino sheep from central Russia  Olkuska sheep from Poland  the morphological type of Vlashko Vitoroga–Pramenka sheep from Serbia and Oxford Down sheep from the UK. All sheep breeds were locally developed breeds except for Oxford Down  which is a synthetic commercial English breed []. Kainuu Grey  Åland  Oparino  Olkuska and Vlashko Vitoroga-Pramenka sheep have undergone a reduction in population size during the last 10 years and are rare or endangered breeds. Results from a Y-chromosome SNP  1 analysis in ancient sheep were compared with those of a global sheep Y-chromosome study including Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey and Åland sheep []. Bone samples were prepared by removing the outer layer of the bones and collecting 50 to 200 mg of bone powder with a drill. DNA extraction was carried out in an air-controlled sterile laboratory and in a laminar flow hood (EU-14 HEPA filtered air under positive air pressure isolation). Separate laboratories were used for sample preparation  DNA extraction and PCR amplification. The laboratories and equipment were UV-treated and bleach was used to clean the laminar and laboratory regularly. Protective whole body suits  double gloves and masks were used inside the aDNA laboratory. Two aDNA laboratories participated in aDNA analyses (MTT Agrifood Research Finland and Stockholm University  Sweden). DNA extraction was carried out as described in []. The bone powder was digested in 900 µL 0.5 M EDTA  100 µL 10 M urea and 5 µL proteinase K (20 mg/ml) with constant stirring at 55°C overnight. After centrifugation (2000 rpm for 5 min)  the supernatant was concentrated and DNA was extracted with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen  Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 523-bp sequence of mtDNA encompassing part of the mtDNA D-loop from ancient sheep ([GenBank:NC001941] positions 15 978-16 501) was analysed. A 130-bp sequence in the 5’-promoter region of the  gene on ovine Y-chromosome ([GenBank:AY604734] positions 58–179) was analysed to detect the Y-chromosome SNP marker ( 1) [GenBank:AY604734.2:g.67  A>G]. Primers [see Additional file : Table S1] for five overlapping fragments of mtDNA D-loop sequence and one Y-chromosome  gene fragment were designed with Primer3 [] using mtDNA and  gene reference sequences [GenBank:NC001941] and [GenBank:AF026566.1]  respectively. PCR for ancient DNA was performed in 25 µL mixture that contained 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen  Sweden)  0.2 µM of each primer  0.4 mM dNTP  2.5 mM MgCl (Qiagen  Sweden)  0.25 units (U) of Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG  Sigma-Aldrich)  1.5 U of HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen  Sweden) and 5–10 µL of DNA extract. The PCR program consisted in initial steps at 37°C for 10 min and 95°C for 15 min followed by 55 three-step cycles at 94°C for 30 s  AT°C for 40s and 72°C for 1 min and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. AT stands for the annealing temperature specific to each primer set [see Additional file : Table S1]. Common measures to prevent contamination were used [  ]  such as separated areas for sample preparation  ancient DNA analyses and pre-PCR  wearing protective clothing  using disposable tools and pipettes with aerosol resistant filter tips and treating equipment and working surfaces with bleach and ultra-violet irradiation frequently (see DNA extraction and laboratory methods). Overlapping primers specific to sheep DNA were designed to prevent possible annealing to human DNA and were checked by amplification (see DNA extraction and laboratory methods). The authenticity of the aDNA analysis was controlled at various steps of the laboratory work-flow. In general  when consistent sequences were obtained in three or more amplifications  the sequence was considered reproducible and accepted as authentic. In the aDNA extraction step  13 of the samples (out of the 26 samples which were successfully amplified for the 523-bp mtDNA D-loop sequence) (Table ) were extracted several times  and at least two PCR-reactions were performed for separate DNA extractions to amplify and sequence each overlapping mtDNA D-loop fragment at least twice. Applying these strict extraction and amplification steps aimed at confirming the reproducibility of our aDNA sequence protocol and no sequence anomalies were detected. Moreover  five samples (OaM1  OaNaa1  OaTor2  OaÅA5 and OaÅA6) were extracted  amplified and sequenced in two different aDNA laboratories (MTT Agrifood Research Finland and Stockholm University  Sweden) and the results were identical. At each step of the aDNA extraction and amplification procedure  negative controls were performed. In the first extraction of our aDNA trial  a mammoth sample was used as positive control  which constitutes a suitable control because a previous study [] has shown that it does contain mammoth DNA  it does not contain modern DNA and its sequence clearly differs from that of sheep. DNA from 94 modern sheep of 10 European and Asian breeds [  ] were analysed. Additional file : Table S1 includes primers for the amplification of a 664-bp sequence of mtDNA [see Additional file : Table S1]. The same PCR reaction mix was used for these samples than for the aDNA samples except that UNG was not included. PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 15 min followed by 32 three-step cycles at 94°C for 30 s  58°C for 40 s and 72° for 1 min and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. 500 ng of template DNA were used per reaction. Y-chromosome marker data were available from a previous study []. PCR products of modern and ancient DNA samples were purified using ExoSAP-IT enzyme (GE Healthcare Life sciences  UK). Sequencing reactions were performed using DYEnamic ET Terminator Kit (GE Healthcare Life sciences  UK). The sequencing products were purified by ethanol precipitation and separated on MegaBACE1000™ (Amersham Biosciences  UK). Both strands of each fragment were sequenced and the same primers were used for both sequencing and fragment amplification. Sequence data were base-called with Cimarron 3.12 basecaller using a MegaBACE Sequence analyzer v. 3.0.0111.1603 (Amersham Biosciences  UK). Sequences were analysed with Sequencher 4.6 8 (Gene Codes  Ann Arbor  MI). Mitochondrial DNA sequences from 94 modern sheep [GenBank: JX484017-JX484110] and 26 ancient sheep [GenBank: JX484111-JX484137] were aligned using CLUSTALW2 [] (penalties for gap opening  gap extension  gap distances were 10  0.20 and 5  respectively). When statistical analyses were performed for a subset of sequences  the CLUSTALW2 alignment was carried out separately for each cohort. The size of the aligned mtDNA sequence was 523-bp. One Iron Age sample (OaPas1)  for which only 297-bp of the mtDNA D-loop was sequenced  was omitted from the statistical analyses (Table ). A corresponding CLUSTALW2 alignment was done for the Y-chromosome 130-bp sequences [JX484138- JX484140]. Alignment gaps were excluded from the statistical analyses. The appropriate DNA substitution model to analyse our mtDNA data was the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model ([]; HKY85)+<U+0413> supported both by FindModel [] web server () and MEGA5.05 program [] and selected on the basis of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [] for different models. The phylogenetic analysis of the 94 modern and 26 ancient sheep sequences and one outgroup sequence from urial sheep ( [GenBank:AF039580.1]) was conducted using two approaches. MEGA5.05 was used to construct the Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates. However  the Tamura-Nei substitution model [] with a <U+0413> distribution parameter value a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 was used in the analysis because HKY is not implemented in the MEGA software and the Tamura-Nei model was supported by AIC. The maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was performed using PhyML v. 3.0 program [] and the HKY85+<U+0413> (lnL<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1271.48434  <U+0413> distribution parameter value a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.047). Bootstrap support for a ML tree was calculated using 1000 bootstrap replicates and the tree was drawn with the TreeView program v. []. In addition  a median-joining network (with e<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 to be most conservative) between the haplotypes was constructed and mismatch distribution was performed using NETWORK 4.6.0.0 []. The following parameters were calculated to estimate the genetic diversity of the mtDNA data in the different cohorts (i.e.  in the ancient populations and modern breeds): number of haplotypes (h)  number of segregating sites (S)  haplotype diversity (Hd<U+2009>=<U+2009>probability that two mtDNA sequences chosen randomly from the sample are different)  nucleotide diversity (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen pairs of sequences)  and average number of nucleotide differences (K) (DnaSP v.5 []). Theta-estimates (‘theta’ <U+03B8><U+2009>=<U+2009>Nµ  where N is the effective population size in the case of a haploid locus and µ is the overall mutation rate at the haplotype level) were computed using ARLEQUIN v. 3.5 []: the expected level of diversity  <U+03B8> was derived from the observed number of segregating sites S and <U+03B8> from the observed mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences p. Furthermore  Tajima’s D test statistic was computed using DnaSP. We investigated the distribution of the ancient mtDNA sequences present among the 94 sequences of the modern sheep samples sequenced here and searched for shared identical sequences in the GenBank DNA database (NCBI/BLAST  ). The haplotypes were determined using DnaSP [see Additional file : Table S2]. The ancient Y-chromosome SNP  1 data were compared with modern data [  ] and geographic frequency distributions of  1 alleles. The modern Y-chromosome SNP data [  ] on the frequencies of  1 alleles are presented in Additional file : Table S3. Nineteen samples were successfully radiocarbon-dated  while for three samples  the quantity of collagen in the enamel was not sufficient for this technique (Table ). The radiocarbon dating indicated that two samples  (OaPih1  OaKök2)  were younger and one (OaUuk2) was older than inferred from the archaeological records from the same sites (Table ). The dating results indicated that the oldest samples successfully analyzed for mtDNA were approximately 1000 years old. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was carried out on 36 ancient sheep samples and mtDNA amplification was successful for 27 samples  including the partial mtDNA sequence of the OaPas1 sample (Table ). Most of these 27 samples required several amplifications per fragment in order to obtain at least three good-quality sequences from at least two PCR reactions. Excluding the samples for which no mtDNA amplification was obtained and considering all separate amplifications for the five mtDNA D-loop fragments  the amplification success rate was 46%  56% and 68% for sheep samples from the Iron Age  Medieval and Post-Medieval periods  respectively. Average amplification success rates and fragment lengths for the mtDNA D-loop sequence are summarised in [Additional file : Table S1]. As expected  with aDNA samples  the highest success rate was obtained when the amplified fragments of mtDNA D-loop were shortest. In addition  among the aDNA samples from different periods  those from the Post-Medieval period had the highest success rate  which is explained by the fact that Post-Medieval material is abundant allowing a more critical prior-selection of bones than for older materials. Reproducible sequences were obtained for seven of the 11 Medieval samples and for five (plus one partial) of the 11 Iron Age samples (Table ). Amplification of a 130-bp sequence of Y-chromosome 5’ promoter region in the  gene was tested in aDNA samples that were successfully amplified for mtDNA and three contained the  gene sequence. As expected  among the different aDNA analyses  amplification success rate was lowest (12%) for the fragment containing the  gene. Alignment between the 94 modern and 26 ancient DNA sequences (OaPas1 containing a partial mtDNA sequence was excluded) revealed 47 SNP (46 transitions and one transversion) and three insertion-deletions [see Additional file : Figure S2]. When considering the alignment of the aDNA samples only  27 transitions and no transversion were found. Fifty-six haplotypes (18 in the ancient and 46 in the modern DNA sequences) were identified among the 121 modern and ancient sheep samples (Figure   Tables  and ). More than half of these haplotypes (30 of 56) were private to one individual and thus to one modern sheep breed or ancient sheep population indicating high variation in the analysed D-loop region.  Branch topography supported by bootstrap values greater than 50% is indicated; the number of samples sharing haplotypes is given in brackets; breed names are abbreviated as Oxford Down (Oxf)  Olkuska (OL)  Pramenka (Pra)  Bozakh (Boz)  Oparino (Opa)  Romanov (Ro)  Viena (Vie)  Kainuu Grey Sheep (Kai)  Åland (ALD) and Finnsheep (Fin); ancient Finnish sheep samples are divided into three periods: Iron Age (Iron)  Medieval (Med) and Post-Medieval (Post) according to radiocarbon or context dating (see Table ); the tree is rooted with a sequence from urial sheep () [GenBank: AF039580.1]. The NJ and ML analyses gave similar phylogenetic topologies thus only the ML tree is presented in Figure . Two highly divergent domestic sheep lineages  ovine mtDNA haplogroups A and B  were detected with relatively high statistical support. As expected  comparisons with reference sequences [GenBank: AF039577.1] and [GenBank: AF039578.1]  haplogroups B and A were respectively the major and minor haplogroups. Frequencies of haplogroups A and B were 0% and 100% for the Iron Age  28.6% and 71.4% for the Medieval and 14.3% and 85.7% for the Post-Medieval sheep cohorts  respectively and 21.9% and 78.1% for the Finnish modern sheep breeds. In addition  the Network analysis and mismatch distribution supported the existence of these two divergent haplogroups in the modern sheep breed data presented in Figures S3 and S4 [see Additional file : Figures S3 and S4]. These analyses reproduced the well-established observations with a star-shaped pattern in the ovine mtDNA haplotype network and a smooth shape of mismatch distribution indicating a population expansion in the history of the species. Similar patterns were observed in the Medieval-Iron Age and Post-Medieval cohorts when analysed separately (results not shown). We analysed the distribution of the 18 ancient Finnish sheep mtDNA haplotypes in the modern sheep breeds by sequencing samples of 10 Eurasian sheep breeds and by searching for shared sequences in the GenBank DNA database. The shared haplotype analysis showed that 14 of the 18 ancient haplotypes were present in the modern sheep breeds and in the GenBank DNA database (Figure ) and [Additional file : Table S2]. In the modern sheep populations  frequencies of ancient haplotypes were highest in the native Finnish sheep breeds  Finnsheep (0.38) and Kainuu Grey (0.53) with six ancient haplotypes i.e. H11 in haplogroup A and H22  H32  H40  H42  H44 in haplogroup B. The two ancient haplotypes  H05 in haplogroup A and H32 in haplogroup B are common haplotypes while other rarer ancient haplotypes exist e.g. in contemporary native breeds from the Caucasus  Russia and Serbia [see Additional file : Table S2]. The four ancient haplotypes H06  H30  H43 and H50 were absent both in our own modern dataset and in the GenBank DNA database [see Additional file : Table S2]. The statistics summarising the level of mtDNA variation in the Finnish ancient populations and modern sheep breeds and in seven other modern Eurasian breeds are presented in Tables  and   respectively. Additional file : Figure S1 shows the sites from which the Finnish archaeological samples were collected and for which mtDNA was successfully amplified. The Iron Age cohort comprising only five samples and excavated at a single archaeological site on the prehistorical farm Mulli displayed the lowest values for all diversity estimates (s  h  Hd  K  and p). Haplotype diversity was higher in ancient sheep samples from the Medieval and Post-Medieval periods (Hd<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0 and 0.98  respectively) than in any of the modern populations. The Post-Medieval samples originated from several archaeological sites  while the Medieval samples were excavated mainly in Turku. Among the modern sheep breeds analysed  Bozakh  Finnsheep and Pramenka showed the highest haplotype diversity (Hd<U+2009>><U+2009>0.90; Tables  and ) while Olkuska and Åland had the lowest haplotype diversity (Hd<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.75; Tables  and ). The Finnsheep samples were collected in several sheep flocks from different parts of Finland. The measures taking in account the molecular nature of the data showed highest variation in the populations and breeds in which both haplogroups A and B were segregating. Nucleotide diversity varied among cohorts and was highest (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>15.51 * 10) in Pramenka sheep  originating from the Balkan region  which was one of the main dispersal routes for Near Eastern domesticated sheep entering Europe. The diversity estimate <U+03B8>s is influenced by genetic bottlenecks  whereas <U+03B8>p is relatively insensitive. Consequently  <U+03B8>p-<U+03B8>s will be negative in stable populations under an infinite-sites model of mutation-drift equilibrium and positive as a result of a reduction in the number of segregating sites. In our data  <U+03B8>p-<U+03B8>s estimates were negative i.e. -1.465 and -1.563 for Post Medieval and modern Finnsheep  respectively (Table )  whereas they were positive for Åland  Kainuu Grey  Olkuska  and Pramenka sheep  and slightly positive for the Pramenka breed and the Medieval population (Tables  and ). Statistically significant Tajima’s D-values were positive for Kainuu Grey and Olkuska sheep  indicating a reduction of mtDNA diversity. For three of the 27 ancient sheep samples  Y-chromosome  sequences were amplified and were thus genetically identified as rams (Table ) with one ram sample from the Medieval period and two from the Post-Medieval period (Table ). All three ancient Finnish sheep had SNP G- 1 in the  gene. In the modern Finnish breeds  the frequency of G- 1 was 77%  57%  and 60% in Finnsheep  Kainuu Grey  and Åland  respectively [see Additional file : Table S3]  indicating that SNP G- is frequent in the modern north-European breeds (Figure ).      Ancient sheep are indicated by a smaller circle over Finland at the northern most location on the map; the remaining circles on the map indicate modern sheep breeds from [  ] listed in [Additional file : Table S3]; the proportions of G- 1 and A- 1 haplotypes are indicated in red and green  respectively; the size of the circles is proportional to sample size in each location. We successfully analysed mtDNA and Y-chromosome diversity in ancient sheep remains from Finland and found that Finnish sheep genetic diversity has been quite constant over the last 1000 years. Our aDNA results fit well with the genetic context of the modern north-European domestic sheep breeds analysed either previously [  ] or in the present study. Both ovine haplogroups A and B have been present in the Finnish sheep population for at least more than 700 years and no remarkable temporal changes in their frequencies have occurred. Four of the 26 ancient mtDNA sequences obtained here were assigned to haplogroup A (the frequency in different ancient cohorts varied from 0 to 28.6%) and 22 sequences to haplogroup B (frequency ranging between 71.4 and 100%). The respective haplogroup A and B frequencies in the present sample set of three Finnish native breeds are 21.9% and 78.1% according to our analysis and 16.7% and 83.3% according to []. Four of the 18 ancient mtDNA haplotypes were present in the modern Finnish native breeds and 14 in the set of 10 Eurasian breeds analysed here. The affinity between modern mtDNA haplotypes and the ancient mtDNA haplotypes not found in the modern breeds is also attested by their proximity within the phylogeny and haplotype network in Figure  and Figure S3 [see Additional file : Figure S3]  respectively. According to historical written records  foreign breeding animals  which were obviously ancestors of the modern Merino sheep  were imported into Finland during the 16th  17th and 18th centuries [  ]. However  most of the imported individuals being rams  they did not have a major impact on the mtDNA diversity in the Finnish native sheep. In addition  results of the Y-chromosome analysis on aDNA agree well with those on DNA from modern Finnish indigenous sheep breeds. SNP G- 1 in the 5’-promoter region of the  gene on sheep Y-chromosome was detected in the three ancient ram samples. Since these ancient ram samples (OaNaa1  OaTor1  OaKök2  Table ) were collected from different excavation sites and from two different time periods (Medieval and Post-Medieval)  it is unlikely that they were close relatives. However  the number of available ancient ram samples is not sufficient to draw detailed conclusions on the temporal changes in the frequencies of G- 1 and A-. In the contemporary native Finnish breeds  the frequency of SNP G- 1 ranges from 57 to 77% [see Additional file : Table S3] and the frequency of SNP G- 1 is highest in north European  British Islands and central Russian populations []  [see Figure  and Additional file : Table S3]. SNP G- 1 is less frequent in southern and central European sheep (25% and 32%  respectively) and very low for the remaining breeds analysed to date (< 8%) [see Figure  and Additional file : Table S3]. The presence of SNP G- 1 in modern sheep populations often reflects introgression of English breeds []. However  this cannot be the case for ancient Finnish sheep. Consequently  our finding that SNP G- 1 is present in sheep aDNA suggests that (at least in Finland) this paternal line predates the arrival of sheep in northern Europe. Our results on radiocarbon-dating of 19 sheep remains excavated from archaeologically important sites in Finland provide essential information for Finnish archaeological research. Our research on ancient sheep material shows that previous attempts to determine the age of remains based on archeological context are fairly accurate  since only in three cases  did the dating results differ from those expected (OaPih1  OaKök2 and OaUuk2  Table ). The oldest samples analysed here originate from the Late Iron Age from the excavation site Mulli in Raisio and from Pasvik in northern Norway. In Finnish archaeology  age determination of specimens is usually based on archaeological context. However  this can be misleading because  in Finland  cultural layers are thin and younger bone and other animal materials may have sunk to earlier cultural layers and thus  the dating of a single bone might differ from the general dating of a site []. Therefore  the dating of archaeological materials by radiocarbon methods is recommended. Here  we investigated the genetic affinities between the ancient Finnish sheep populations and the modern sheep breeds by searching for identical matches in the GenBank DNA database with the ancient haplotype sequences. Comparison of our ancient mtDNA data with those of the contemporary breeds appears to be relatively uninformative in terms of unfolding geographic origin or origins of native sheep in Finland or the dispersal of sheep husbandry to Finland. Our results confirm that the domestic sheep populations share their origins with  populations domesticated in the Near Eastern region  from where the sheep spread around the World  and that whereas haplogroup B is common in Europe  haplogroup A is much rarer [–]. Ancient mtDNA haplotypes can be found in modern sheep breeds originating from geographically distant regions. Ancient Finnish sheep show a maternal genetic affinity to western and southern European breeds  but also to eastern European breeds. For example  haplotype H05 detected in the Post-Medieval sheep is also present in the two Russian (Figure ) and the Iberian sheep breeds [see Additional file : Table S2] and several haplotypes of the haplogroup B detected in the Finnish ancient sheep are present in eastern  western and southern European breeds. However  four mtDNA haplotypes present in the ancient sheep samples are absent in the contemporary sheep breeds suggesting a possible loss of these haplotypes. Our results agree with a previous analysis of mtDNA D-loop polymorphisms on modern Eurasian sheep breeds in which a genetic historical influence of Russian sheep breeds in northern European sheep breeds was detected []. We assume that the fluctuations in mtDNA genetic diversity estimates obtained for the different cohorts (Tables  and ) may be stochastic in nature as a result of genetic drift and sampling. Assuming neutrality for the mtDNA D-loop region  the high positive values for (<U+03B8>p-<U+03B8>s) indicate a loss of genetic variability in terms of number of segregating nucleotide sites  occurring in the modern populations of Åland  Kainuu Grey  Olkuska sheep and the Serbian Pramenka population of Vlashko Vitoroga. These breeds experienced a genetic bottleneck during the 20th century and are classified as endangered sheep breeds []. In addition  their positive Tajima’s D-values – statistically significantly different from zero for Kainuu Grey and Olkuska sheep – point towards an effect of a decline of population size on mtDNA diversity. In contrast  our within-population diversity estimates for Finnsheep  which is a large  major sheep population in Finland and having descended during the 20th century from a broad founder population  do not indicate loss of mtDNA diversity in haplogroup B. However  our Finnsheep data can be considered slightly biased because we could not detect haplogroup A in our sample set []. When the diversity estimates of the ancient samples are compared with those of the modern breeds  values for (<U+03B8>p-<U+03B8>s) and Tajima’s D in the Medieval sheep population are similar to estimates that could be obtained for an endangered modern breed having experienced a reduction in population size. In contrast  the estimates for the Post-Medieval cohort are similar to those of a modern large sheep breed with a growing population size. However  the origin and availability of archaeological materials could explain these differences in estimates rather than demographic events that occurred in the past. The Medieval samples are mainly from one region  the Turku region  while Post-Medieval samples are from a wider geographic region  from southern  northern  western and central parts of Finland. The present Iron Age samples displaying a lower level of mtDNA diversity are from the Mulli farm from Raisio and four of the samples share the same maternal ancestry. Interestingly  it appears that the same sheep ‘dam-lineage’ was raised in Mulli for a long period and no new ewes were introduced into the flock. This aDNA study focusing on sheep biodiversity in Finland shows that population genetic analysis of ancient domestic animal populations and studies investigating changes in genetic diversity across different eras are challenging. The availability of ancient materials and the success rate of ancient DNA analysis have a decisive impact on how comprehensively a sample set represents the genetic variation of ancient animal populations. In the Finnish context  survival of unburned bones from time periods prior to the Late Iron Age is infrequent due to the acid centeracter of soils. In addition  in our study  the Medieval and Post-Medieval samples are not from the same temporal population as the samples of the modern breeds  but mainly from temporally distant generations. For example  the age difference between the oldest and youngest Medieval samples is approximately 300 years  corresponding to a time span of 100 generations. The population structures of ancient and modern cohorts are different  interfering with conclusions on temporal changes between ancient and modern populations. Moreover  the 300 years long Medieval period or Iron Age period were not socially or culturally static and our research area can be roughly divided into western  eastern and northern cultural regions with their own cultural and trade networks possibly influencing the genetic variation and structure of ancient animal populations. More ancient materials are needed to examine the archaeological questions in more detail. To date  mitochondrial DNA has been the most popular genetic marker to centeracterize ancient farm animal populations  to trace their ancestor and reconstitute the number of domestication events. Less is known about Y-chromosome polymorphisms in ancient domestic animals partly due to challenges in Y-chromosome marker typing and partly due to the lack of polymorphic markers currently available for centeracterization. Here we have published one of the most comprehensive mtDNA analysis in ancient sheep populations to date and simultaneously successfully typed the Y-chromosome SNP marker  1 in three ancient sheep samples. Our aDNA results are in agreement with the previous international studies on mtDNA and Y-chromosome diversity of domestic sheep. However  for more detailed archaeological and archaeozoological studies  such as regional historical dispersal of animal populations  and origins and relatedness of ancient animals found in a same excavation site or different sites  the resolving power of mtDNA can be too low. Our mtDNA study indicates that the same ancient and modern ovine mtDNA haplotypes can be detected in geographically distant regions. As indicated by the analysis of modern sheep breeds e.g. [  ]  autosomal nuclear markers  such as microsatellites  sequence data and SNP are powerful population genetic markers. Further studies with these autosomal nuclear markers will offer an opportunity to study archaeological samples in more detail and provide more information about ancient genetic population structure than uniparentally inherited markers.

Depending on breed and method  effective population sizes ranged from 15 to 133 056  computation method and interaction between computation method and species showing a significant effect on effective population size ( < 0.0001). On average  methods based on number of breeding males and females and variance of progeny size produced larger values (4425 and 356  respectively)  than those based on identity by descent probabilities (average values between 93 and 203).

The correlation level between the simplest method (number of breeding males and females  requiring no genealogical information) and the most sophisticated one ranged from 0.44 to 0.60 according to species. When choosing a method to compute effective population size  particular attention should be paid to the species and the specific genetic structure of the population studied. In population genetics  different tools are used to assess genetic diversity for conservation purposes and one of the most commonly used indicators is the effective population size () developed by Wright [].  is defined as the number of reproducing individuals  bred in an idealized population in which all individuals are of the same sex and selfing is permitted  and that leads to the same decrease of genetic diversity than the population being studied []. However  several genetic diversity indicators have been proposed and the most classical ones are genetic drift through temporal changes in allele frequencies (variance of effective population size)  increase in homozygosity (inbreeding effective population size)  or the rate at which unique alleles are lost (eigenvalue effective population size) [  ]. Moreover  different information sources (demographic information  pedigree or molecular data) can be used to estimate . Therefore  when estimating   it is important to know precisely which process is ongoing and to have the information used to assess it []. Until the recent development of dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips  it was generally recommended to assess genetic variability within a population from pedigree data if available  which is often the case in captive or domestic animal populations [  ]. On the basis of demographic/pedigree data  several methods have been proposed to compute . Ideally  they should lead to the same  estimate [  ] but they differ in terms of which Wright-Fisher properties (among others) are considered []. For instance  variance of progeny size []  an indicator of both change in allele frequency and inbreeding (at least for unselected populations)  is frequently used to compute . A large number of methods also focus on the increase in homozygosity over generations by measuring Identity By Descent (IBD) probability. IBD probability represents the probability that two randomly chosen alleles of an individual are inherited from the same ancestor. Inbreeding  and coancestry  (also called kinship) coefficients are two classical genealogical estimators of IBD probability [] that differ according to whether the considered alleles are from a single individual  or two individuals  respectively. The relation between IBD and  is based on the classical formula where <U+0394> is the rate of IBD  classically estimated by the rate of inbreeding <U+0394> as <U+0394>  i.e. the evolution of the average coefficient of inbreeding  over time []. However  recently  new methods have been proposed to compute <U+0394> from an approximate rooting of individual inbreeding coefficients based on pedigree knowledge (Equivalent complete generations  ) []. Cervantes et al. [] have also suggested using coancestry instead of inbreeding for IBD estimation. All these methods do not differ only in terms of the indicator or force observed  but also in terms of the time scale investigated and the amount of available information. Moreover  they are more or less sensitive to the level of pedigree knowledge and to some parameters related to breeding conditions  such as the existence of population subdivisions or departure of the random mating hypothesis  which may lead to biased  estimates. Depending on the context and the authors  one or several of these methods have been applied to domestic breeds [–] and captive animal populations [  ]. More specifically  the fact that in a number of breeds  no pedigree information is available  the simplest approximation of  (computed on the basis of number of breeding males and females) has been used to classify the endangerment level of breeds by the European Association for Animal Production (EAAP)  and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Our study aimed at comparing several methods used to estimate  from pedigree data for a wide range of domestic animal populations. One hundred and forty breeds from four different species  i.e. dog  sheep  cattle and horse  were used. These include intensively selected breeds with large current population sizes  as well as endangered breeds benefiting from conservation programs. Six different methods for computing  were compared in order to provide practical advice to breeders and stakeholders  for choosing endangerment thresholds according to species and for predicting  accurately with more or less sophisticated methods. Pedigree files for 60 dog  40 sheep  20 cattle and 20 horse breeds were extracted from French national data bases. For each species  breeds were chosen to represent a wide range of situations i.e. actual population size  endangerment status (28 populations among the sheep  cattle  and horse breeds studied have received financial support from the French government through subsidies for endangered breeds)  breeding purpose (for example  selection for meat or milk)  or geographical origin (local  imported or transnational populations). In order to define the reference populations  generation intervals () were computed in the four pathways (see below)  as the average age of parents when their useful offspring are born (i.e. offspring  which in turn become parents) over a 10 year period before a reference year (2005 for dog breeds (see [])  and 2007 for sheep  cattle and horse breeds). Reference populations were defined as all the individuals (or only females for sheep and cattle breeds  given the small number of males raised in these species) with both parents known  born during a generation interval period before the reference year. Wright’s model [] for estimating  is based on sex ratio. This very simple method is supposed to reflect the increased effects of both inbreeding and variance of progeny size under several assumptions  including random mating  no selection and random variation of progeny size across parents. Computation of  only requires the estimated numbers of breeding males () and females () in the reference population and follows equation (): This method is more sophisticated than the previous one since it directly takes into account the observed variance of progeny size []. Parents of the reference population are considered as a group of useful offspring. In each pathway ( = sire-sire   = sire-dam   = dam-sire or  = dam-dam)  observed variance () and covariance () of progeny size are computed considering those individuals and their own parents (i.e. the grand-parents of the reference population).  is then computed using equation () in which  and  are the numbers of new male and female parents beginning to reproduce each year averaged over the 10 years before the reference year: Considering two successive generations  and -1  inbreeding rate (<U+0394>) can be computed using equation () according to []  in which  is the average coefficient of inbreeding of the reference population  and  the average coefficient of inbreeding of their parents: The effective population size can then be computed using the formula  = 1/2<U+0394>. Taking into consideration the average coefficient of coancestry ()  the preceding model can be applied using   the average coefficient of coancestry between the animals in the reference population  and   the average coefficient of coancestry between the parents of this reference population  instead of  and . Since the number of coancestry coefficients to be computed within a population of size  is equal to ( -1)/2  computation of average coancestry can be very time-consuming in large populations. Therefore  when ( -1)/2 is larger than 100 000  100 000 pairs of individuals are sampled at random with  estimated as the mean value of the 100 000 computed coefficients. Guttiérez et al [] proposed a method in which the level of pedigree knowledge of a given individual  is estimated by the number of equivalent complete generations traced ()  computed as the sum over all known ancestors of the terms (1/2)  where  is the ancestor’s generation number  which is equal to one for the parents  two for the grandparents  etc. []. The approximate individual inbreeding rate <U+0394> is calculated according to equation () in which  is the coefficient of inbreeding of individual i: Individual inbreeding rates are averaged as  which leads to the following estimate of : while the standard error can be approximated as: with  being the reference population size and  the standard deviation of <U+0394>. Cervantes et al [] proposed to approximate coancestry rate <U+0394> between two individuals  and  using equation ()  in which  and  are their respective equivalent complete traced generations  and  their coefficient of coancestry: When necessary  the coancestry over 100 000 pairs of sampled individuals was averaged  while the standard error of  was approximated as: where  is the number of coefficients computed (either ( -1)/2 or 100 000) and  is the standard deviation of <U+0394>. In order to characterise the differences between average inbreeding  and coancestry  coefficients within reference populations  an equivalent of Nei’s fixation index [] was computed as follows: All the pedigree analyses were performed using PEDIG software [] and our own FORTRAN routine procedures. In order to assess the ranges of  values according to species and methods  variance was analysed using SAS software (version 9.1.3 for windows)  removing the results with a negative <U+0394>  with REML.  was considered as the dependent variable with the following model: where  is the computation method   the species and  the interaction between computation method and species  all considered as explanatory fixed factors  and  is the error term following a distribution N(0 s). This model was chosen because when including breed as a random effect (here  breeds are considered as samples within each species) no significant effect was observed and because the model minimizes both Akaike Information (AIC) and Bayesian Information (BIC) Criteria (see Additional file : Table S1). Finally  in addition to assessing ranges of  values  we examined if ranking was similar with the different methods by performing for each species  a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  considering breeds as observations and the six methods as variables. Depending on breed and species  reference population sizes ranged from 110 (Barbet dog breed) to 2 122 041 (Holstein cattle breed). Only six cattle  one sheep and one horse breeds had a reference population size larger than 100 000 and only one cattle  six sheep  five horse and six dog breeds had a reference population size smaller than 1000 [see Additional file : Table S1 to S4]. The timeframe used to constitute the reference populations was computed on the basis of the average generation interval  for each species. The mean value of  across breeds varied among species (Table ). In particular  horse breeds had quite larger  values than cattle  sheep or dog breeds (T-test   < 0.001) whereas the level of pedigree knowledge was lower for horses than for the other species with an average  equal to 4.4 ( < 0.001) compared to 6.1  6.0 and 5.8 in cattle  sheep and dog  respectively. This difference may be explained by the high level of crossbreeding in horse populations  since the pedigree files chosen here were restricted to purebred animals. Similar to the heterogeneity of pedigree knowledge  average IBD coefficients (average  and ) ranged from 0.2% ( and  in Comtois horse breed) to 9.1% ( in the Barbet dog breed). Pearson correlations between  and IBD coefficients were equal to 0.45 and 0.23 for  and   respectively  while they were larger ( = 0.67) between  and  [see Additional file : Figures S1  S2  S3]. Differences between  and   measured by the fixation index   varied more or less according to species. Average  values were negative in cattle  sheep and horse breeds i.e. -0.45%  -0.37%  -0.1%  respectively and positive i.e. 1.37% (with  < 0.001) in dog breeds  underlining the existence of population substructure within most dog breeds. Depending on breed  species and method   values varied greatly i.e. between 15 ( for the Saarloos Wolfdog breed) and 133 056 ( for the Charolais cattle breed). When IBD rate was negative i.e. indicating a decrease in  or  between the last two generations   (four breeds) and  (one breed) were not calculated. Effects of “computation method” and “interaction of computation method x species” on  were significant ( < 0.0001) unlike that of “species” only ( = 0.06). Indeed  the different models applied produced contrasted results (Figure  and Table ) i.e.  estimates were much larger with  (4425 on average) and  to a lesser extent  with  (356 on average) than with  (93)   (138)   (160) and  (203)  although some differences were observed among these last four methods. In relation to the positive  values obtained for dog breeds   values were higher with the two methods based on coancestry  ( = 204 and  = 241 on average) compared to those based on inbreeding  ( = 89 and  = 80 on average) ( < 0.0001). Such a significant difference was not observed for the other species. As illustrated in Table S5 of Additional file   residual standard deviations varied with “computation method” and “species” i.e. for IBD methods: they ranged from 54 ( for dog) to 253 ( for cattle); for   they reached 36 268 for cattle. This result justified the computation of an error component specific for “computation method” and “species”. With the methods based on IBD rate  within-population standard errors (s.e.) ranged from 0.1 to 10.1 for  and from 0 to 172.9 for . Among the 140 breeds studied here  s.e. mean values were equal to 1.3 and 7.0 for  and   respectively (s.d. mean values across breeds were equal to 1.6 and 20.0  respectively; results not shown).  Standard errors are indicated. Results of the principal component analysis showed that the two main components explained between 74% (dog) and 87% (cattle) of the total inertia depending on the species considered. Two tendencies were observed. For cattle  each variable was highly correlated with the first component ( > 0.72) [see Additional file ]  while for dog   and  were correlated weakly with the first component ( = 0.03 and 0.22  respectively) but highly with the second component ( = 0.80 for both variables). For sheep and horse  intermediate values were obtained. These results agree with the Kendall correlations computed between each method (Table ). For dog   and  were moderately correlated with the other estimates (below 0.36 compared to above 0.45 in all other cases). From a general point of view   was highly correlated with the other estimates (0.52 on average) while  was moderately correlated (0.33 on average). Figure  illustrates the differences in  values for the different methods according to whether a breed is receiving or not financial support because of its endangered status (this is true for some cattle  horse and sheep breeds but not for rare dog breeds  which do not receive public financial help). With models  and    rankings did not differ significantly between endangered and non-endangered breeds. With the other models   values ( < 0.01) were lower for endangered than non-endangered breeds although they were not entirely discriminated.  red X = breeds receiving endangered breed subsidies; blue  = other breeds; difference in ranking between both categories using the Wilcoxon test: ns non significant  ** P < 0.01  *** P < 0.001. This study allowed us to analyse the specificities of each of the four included species with regards to the assessment of their effective population size estimated with different approaches. Genealogical parameters were quite similar to previously reported results [–  –]  although for horse  pedigree knowledge was relatively low  because horse breeds’ pedigree were restricted to individuals belonging to each breed. We would also like to underline that the Pearson correlations between  and IBD estimators were moderate  indicating that the regression suggested by Nagy et al. [] between pedigree knowledge and IBD is not straightforward. The effective population sizes computed here were on average of the same magnitude as those reported in other studies using similar approaches for cattle [    ]  sheep [  ]  or horse [  ]. For dog  previous studies [  –] applied inbreeding approaches to compute   with average values close to 100 (ranging from 17 to 1090)  which is in agreement with our results. In this data set  the largest populations concerned cattle as expected  given the high level of homogenization in this species due to intense selection. For instance  in France  out of 46 different cattle breeds  the main five breeds (namely  Holstein  Charolais  Limousine  Montbéliarde and Blonde d’Aquitaine) account for 80% of the total cattle stock (estimated to be 8 million cows; source: France Génétique Elevage  ). Among the six methods used to compute  for cattle populations  those based on sex-ratio () and those taking into account variance of progeny size () or directly measuring IBD increase produced very different results (Figure ). This is explained by the wide use of artificial insemination (AI) in cattle (particularly in dairy cattle) with a small number of sires producing thousands of offspring  although cattle have a low prolificacy compared to dogs. Such a contrast was not observed for sheep because (among other reasons) AI is not as developed in sheep as in cattle and a ram cannot provide as many doses as a bull. For dog  the most striking result was the difference between methods based on coancestry  and those on inbreeding  evolutions  which is linked to the positive  values found for this species. Under panmixia  both  and  parameters are assumed to differ only by    the average coancestry of reproducers corresponding to the average inbreeding of the next generation. This is why  in random mating conditions at least  it is expected that  is larger than   and thus that  is negative. This was not the case for most of the dog breeds (and some breeds of the other species) either because of the existence of subpopulations or of particular breeding practices such as a high frequency of mating between close relatives []. As a consequence  when  was used instead of  to compute   on average   was divided by more than two in dogs. Indeed  it has been shown that if inbreeding is used as an estimator of population genetic diversity bias can occur because of population substructure [  ]. Such phenomena are often observed for dog breeds. Since all previous reports on  of dog breeds were based on  coefficients  they must be largely underestimated. From a more general point of view  for a domestic or captive population with more or less substructure  the method based on coancestry is the most appropriate to compute . Table  lists the factors and assumptions that distinguish the six genealogical methods that were applied to compute . First  these methods measured different parameters; some methods used demographic parameters [] to assess variance in allele frequencies and increase in inbreeding  i.e. number of reproducers for  and variance of their progeny size for   whereas other methods used coancestry or inbreeding rate to measure the evolution of IBD probability directly. In addition  estimation of these rates differed with the method used  which  among other consequences  impacted the time scale considered. The advantage of methods based on IBD increases between successive generations ( and ) is the possibility of choosing the time length included in the computation model and thus analysing the evolution of IBD probability during a variable number of years or generations. However  they also have several weaknesses that are related with the fluctuation of IBD over time because of changes in breeding schemes  registration of individuals without knowing their pedigree or sampling effects. Indeed  IBD can decrease over a given period  leading to a negative  value. This is a problem  particularly when analysing a large number of breeds in which case  determining a time period during which IBD does not decrease in any of the breeds is almost impossible. Here  we chose a relatively short period of time (two generations) to estimate  and   and among the 280 estimations  negative values were observed in five cases only. In the literature  studies considering longer periods of time to compute  encountered the same problem even for a more or less small number of breeds [    ]. Methods based on individual IBD probabilities ( and ) clearly overcome this problem  since the computation is based on the rooting of IBD coefficients by . With these methods  knowledge of the whole pedigree is taken into account. However  this means that for breeds with different levels of pedigree knowledge  the time period considered will vary according to breed. Another difference in these methods is the sample considered and therefore the precision of  estimation. Since coancestry is averaged on a much larger number of coefficients than inbreeding (see Table )  the precision of  estimation is expected to be higher in the first case  as underlined by Cervantes et al. []. For breeds with large current population sizes  it may be necessary to average coancestry on a sample of individual pairs (100 000 in our case) to overcome the problem of computing time. Even in such situations  standard error was on average five times lower with coancestry than with inbreeding. The issue of minimum viable population sizes is not new and it has been suggested to use  thresholds of 50 and 500 for risks of extinction on the short or long runs  respectively []. Although the existence of these “magic numbers” has been discussed and criticized  they do constitute an interesting tool for stakeholders []. According to the FAO []  a breed can be categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less or equal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less or equal to 5  and endangered if the total number of breeding females is less or equal to 1000 or the total number of breeding males is less or equal to 20. Since pedigree information is not always available  i.e. for livestock breeds in developing countries or wild populations  the FAO has based its recommendations on sex ratio considerations (similar to those in the  computation) to determine the level of endangerment of a breed. However  as underlined in our study and by Martyniuk []  the FAO figures for breed risk-status do not provide a full picture of the level of genetic diversity. Given the contrasted results obtained for cattle between the  and the more sophisticated methods  we recommend choosing a higher threshold when considering endangerment level of cattle in comparison to other species  at least in breeds in which animals are mainly bred via AI. Comparing rankings of  estimated with the method based on sex-ratio and the more sophisticated ones showed interesting results. In the comparison with the  method  which does not suffer from bias linked to population substructure  sampling size or IBD decrease  the correlation ranged among species from 0.44 (cattle) to 0.60 (sheep). By contrast  correlations between  that takes variance of progeny size into account and  were much larger and ranged ranging from 0.59 (dog) to 0.74 (horse). This indicates that  even if the number of reproducing males and females is a major explanatory factor for variation in effective population size  other parameters and  in particular  unbalanced progeny sizes may differ greatly according to breeds. Thus  caution must be taken when interpreting estimated effective population sizes. According to the French law  a breed may receive financial support as an endangered breed  if it is considered as a French indigenous population and if the total number of females is below a threshold defined - by species - by the European Union (European Union Commission Regulation 445/2002 and 817/2002). As an example  the Clun Forest or the Finnish sheep breeds are not considered as endangered since they are not French. This explains why even if  is estimated with the method based on demographic parameters ()  some breeds receive financial support although they have a larger  than others which do not receive support. This discrepancy is even more pronounced with other methods that take into account other parameters impacting effective population size (Figure ). Among other methods to measure effective population size  molecular approaches may constitute an interesting option  especially if many markers are available. Indeed  methods based on linkage disequilibrium may provide interesting and original information since they can estimate the evolution of effective population size over former generations []. When computing effective population size for the international Holstein breed  using between 3000 and 10 000 SNP and the linkage disequilibrium approach  de Roos et al. [] reported  values ranging from 64 to 90 according to country  which are of the same order of magnitude as those calculated in our study with the most sophisticated methods  = 93 and  = 91. However  it should be underlined that similar to the pedigree-based methods  the different molecular methods may give divergent results depending on the sampling strategy or the parameter used to compute  (evolution of heterozygosity or variance of allele frequency over time  linkage disequilibrium …) [  ]. Moreover  given the cost of genotyping  pedigree knowledge will continue to represent a valuable information source in the coming years in many cases. In this study  we show that indicators of effective population size may follow different trends depending on the species studied and  in particular  on the genetic structure existing within the breed. Further studies are necessary to improve the accuracy of genealogical methods  for instance taking better account of heterogeneity in pedigree knowledge. Finally  it must be stated  that for conservation issues  socio-cultural background is at least as important as effective population size  and should  when possible  be taken into account when assessing the endangerment level of a given breed (e.g.  []).
