This study evaluated different methods to estimate lactation yield and sampling schedules with fewer test-day records per lactation to determine recording regimes that (1) estimate lactation yield with a minimal impact on the accuracy of selection and (2) optimise the available resources. Using Sahiwal cattle as a tropical dairy breed example  weekly milk records from 464 cows were used in a simulation study to generate different shaped lactation curves. The daily milk yields from these simulated lactation curves were subset to equally spaced (weekly  monthly and quarterly) and unequally spaced (with four  five or six records per lactation) test-day intervals. Lactation yield estimates were calculated from these subsets using two methods: the test-interval method and Wood’s (Nature 216:164-165  1967) lactation curve model. Using the resulting lactation yields  breeding values were predicted and comparisons were made between the sampling regimes and estimation methods. The results show that  based on the mean square error of prediction  use of Wood’s lactation curve model to estimate total yield was more accurate than use of the test-interval method. However  the differences in the ranking of animals were small  i.e. a 1 to 5% difference in accuracy. Comparisons between the different test-day sampling regimes showed that  with the same number of records per lactation (for example  quarterly and four test-days)  strategically timed test-days can result in more accurate estimates of lactation yield than test-days at equal intervals. An important outcome of these results is that combining Wood’s model for lactation yield estimation and as few as four  five or six strategically placed test-day records can produce estimates of lactation yield that are comparable with estimates based on monthly test-day records using the test-interval method. Furthermore  calculations show that although using fewer test-days results in a decrease in the accuracy of selection  it does provide an opportunity to progeny-test more sires. Thus  using strategically timed test-days and Wood’s model to estimate lactation yield  can lead to a more efficient use of the allocated resources. Breed improvement and selection in dairy systems of developing countries is a challenge because field conditions are restricted by limited resources and infrequent milk recording. In these situations  frequent test-day (TD) recording throughout the entire lactation for genetic evaluation purposes is difficult and impractical []. This lack of data availability highlights the need to optimise the contribution of each collected record to the genetic evaluation process []. Therefore  in such situations  there is a need to develop an efficient TD sampling regime and subsequent genetic evaluation system that optimises selection outcomes given the current resources for TD recording. In dairy systems  genetic test-day models (TDM) provide a solution to the lack of data since they can effectively use fewer records []-[]. However  TDM require accurate estimates of many genetic parameters calculated from large datasets [] []  which are difficult to obtain in developing country scenarios and hence can cause inaccurate results [] []. Therefore  an approach in which lactation yield is first estimated and subsequently used for breeding value estimation may be more appropriate. There are numerous methods to estimate lactation yield based on TD records. The test-interval method (TIM) is the reference method to calculate lactation yield [] and is particularly useful in developing dairy sectors. Other methods involve the use of mathematical lactation models to predict milk yield. TD data from Sahiwal cattle  a tropical dairy breed from Pakistan []  have been used in a number of studies that compare different lactation models. These studies indicated that suitable models include the inverse polynomial function proposed by Nelder []  the incomplete gamma-type function proposed by Wood [] and the Wilmink model []-[]. Various studies have investigated which of each these models is the most appropriate in different tropical or sub-tropical conditions [] []-[]. Although some results of these studies are conflicting  it is clear that the most suitable model is the Wood model because of its ability to fit different shaped curves and its relative ease to describe characteristics of the lactation curve []-[]. Furthermore  we recently reported that the Wood model is more robust than others when fitting lactation curves to infrequent and irregular test-day sampling regimes (TDSR)  which are common in developing country scenarios []. For these reasons  the Wood model was used for data modelling and simulation of datasets for this study  although it is expected that other models of similar complexity would give similar results. Previous studies have clearly shown that as milk recording frequency decreases  the accuracy of the lactation yield estimates also decreases []-[]. Despite this  it is possible to record milk yield monthly or even just four or five times throughout a lactation and still estimate lactation yields sufficiently accurately to rank cows for selection based on milk production []-[]. Some studies considered using unequally spaced sampling regimes with more TD around the peak of lactation or timed according to the visits of an AI (artificial insemination) technician. These studies found that  although the lactation yield estimates were less accurate when TD were unequally spaced []  they did provide an opportunity to assess more bulls with the same resources while maintaining the reliability of the resulting sires’ estimated breeding values (EBV) []. What has not been directly considered is whether as few as four  five  or six TD strategically timed throughout lactation would have an effect on the accuracy of EBV for lactation yield. Therefore  the aim of this study was to investigate whether using fewer  but more strategic TD sampling approaches  and the Wood lactation model would improve the accuracy of lactation yield estimates and EBV for milk production. Milk records from Sahiwal cattle were used to simulate lactation curves as an example of the production in tropical dairy breeds. The simulated data were then used to compare different TDSR with only four  five or six sampling days within one lactation. Then  comparisons of EBV between sampling and estimation methods were assessed to determine the most efficient approach to estimate breeding values given the resources available. Sahiwal cattle were used as an example of a typical tropical dairy breed. Sahiwal lactation records collected between 2005 and 2010 from the Livestock Production Research Institute (LPRI)  Bahadurnagar Okara  Pakistan  were used. The raw data consisted of 839 lactations with weekly TD records from 464 dams from 82 sires  with an average of 5.65 daughters per sire. The dams ranged in age from three to over ten years  with approximately 25% of lactations from cows in their first lactation  45% from the second to fourth lactation  and the remaining 30% from the fifth lactation and above. Using these TD records  Wood’s [] lactation curve model was fitted to each lactation. This model is defined as follows in its original nonlinear form () and its linear form (): where () is the model-based lactation yield at time  (days in milk (DIM))  <U+2009>ln  and where     and  specify the shape of the lactation curve. To obtain estimates of the various components of the Wood model for the simulation study  the raw Sahiwal TD records were fitted using a nonlinear mixed model. This was done by the nlme() function of R Version 3.0.2 []  using the methods documented in Pinheiro et al. []. In this case the model fitted was: where    indexes the particular cow  with  = 1  2  …   and  is the number of cows in the dataset. The linear form () of the Wood model was used here because of its closer approximation of parameters (    ) to a multivariate normal distribution []  as required for the model assumptions to be met. The Wood model can be developed further as a nonlinear mixed model with additive (linear) sub-models for    and  such that: where    and  are overall fixed parameter intercepts     and  are the fixed effects of each parameter for month of calving (MOC)  year of milking (Year) and age (Age) of the cow at calving     and  are cow-specific polygenic random effects  and    and  are cow-specific “environmental” random effects. These random components will have multivariate normal distributions such that: and where  indexes the cow  with  = 1  2  …   and  is the number of cows in the dataset. First  considering the polygenic terms (   and )  it will be assumed that <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)'  <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)' and <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)' have the following distributions:    and   where  links the “phenotypes” (   or ) to the animal pedigree records  and  is the numerator relationship matrix. In the current situation  it was assumed that only one lactation is simulated per cow  so <U+2009>=<U+2009>. It is also assumed that the “environmental” components <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)'  <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)' and <U+2009>=<U+2009>( <U+2009> <U+2009>… <U+2009>)' are all independent and their covariances are assumed to be 0  i.e.    and . Putting these together  equation () yields: (assuming <U+2009>=<U+2009>)  and equation () yields From the initial nlme() model output that fitted the Wood model to the raw Sahiwal lactation records  estimates of the fixed effects of  and  and the variance and covariance matrix of the combined random effects (<U+2009>  <U+2009> and <U+2009>) were obtained. This variance-covariance matrix was split up to resemble the separate random cow-effects (   and ) and the random “environmental” effects (   and )  such that simulated lactation curves yielded realistic curves. For the purposes of the simulation  non-zero covariances were used in equation () but all covariances in equation () were set equal to 0 (see Additional file ). These two variance-covariance matrices and the relationship matrix (  based on the LPRI pedigree) were used with the rmvnorm() [] function of R Version 3.0.2 [] to generate random effects drawn from multivariate normal distributions (equations () and ()) for a simulated population. These were then added to the estimates of fixed effects parameters (from the Sahiwal lactation data) to yield realistic simulated values for  and  according to equation (). The outcomes of this simulation were values for    and  for a population of Sahiwal cattle (where  = 464) that calved in January 2006 at 4 years of age. The resulting lactation curves had a general shape that had an average peak of production and high persistency (APHP; a slowly declining curve). A second set of data was simulated in which only the fixed effect of age was changed to 9 years to generate lactation curves that on average had a higher peak and a less persistent tail (HPLP). The fixed effects of 4 and 9 years of age were selected for the simulation since they yielded lactation curves that were quite different in shape  yet still typical of Sahiwal cows. Plots of the average simulated lactation curves that highlight differences between these fixed effects are in Figure .  One population of animals was simulated with an average peak and persistent tail (APHP; dashed line ---)  which represented 4-year old animals. The other population had a higher peak and less persistent tail (HPLP; solid line <U+2015>) to simulate 9-year old animals. To ensure that the simulated datasets were realistic to the Pakistani situation  a random error term e was added to each simulated day of milking (according to equation ()) to take into account the important environmental variation that occurs in milk production due to daily variation in nutrition  management and other factors. Note that the random errors were taken as independent  although in reality they may be serially correlated with an autoregressive error structure. To calculate the true simulated lactation yield () for animal  within the herd  the yield on each DIM ( = 1  2  3 …  280) was summed according to the following equation; This value  was calculated for each animal and is considered the ‘true’ lactation yield from the simulations. This was done separately for the simulated datasets for which animals were 4 (APHP) and 9 (HPLP) years old. An assumed lactation length of 280 days was used here since the average lactation length in Sahiwal cattle in Pakistan is 235 days [] and only a small proportion of animals produce milk for more than 305 days []. Standard lactation yield estimation methods use the TIM based on TD records collected at equally spaced weekly  monthly and quarterly intervals. By sub-setting the simulated data to represent these recording regimes  lactation yields were calculated (    ) and used for comparison with other TDSR and estimations using Wood’s model. The main aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using fewer () TD per lactation (where  is equal to 4  5 or 6)  strategically timed throughout lactation to estimate lactation yield. In order to determine the ‘ideal’ TDSR  numerous TD combinations were tested and compared. The number of possible TDSR within a single lactation is very large. For example  from a lactation of 280 DIM  if each combination of five ( = 5) randomly selected TD was tested  there would be over 1.6<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 possible combinations. Since it is unrealistic to compare each of these possible TDSR  a method was developed to refine the selection process of the TDSR to be tested based on previous results. A diagram of this process is in Figure   and details are given below.  This diagram outlines the method in which the pool of days in milk (DIM) to select  = 4  5  or 6 test-days (TD) from is refined following each loop. The process of TDSR comparison was carried out over a number of loops by selecting combinations of  (= 4  5 or 6) TD from the pool of DIM. In the first loop  the pool of TD included all DIM (1 …  280). In subsequent loops  the pool of DIM was reduced by one quarter based on the results from the previous loop (see Figure ). The steps to compare TD within each loop were as follows: Step 1: Select  TD at random from the pool without replacement. This will make up one TDSR for comparison (TDSR). This was repeated until every TD from the pool was represented at least once in a selected TDSR. Step 2: Repeat ‘Step 1’ until each TD in the pool is represented in at least 25 different TDSR  to ensure that there are enough repeated measurements to justify valid comparisons when TD are evaluated. Fewer repeats could have been used (for example 5)  but for the purposes of this study  25 were used to allow for greater certainty in the assessment of the contribution of each DIM to the lactation yield estimate. Step 3: For each randomly selected TDSR  the corresponding TD yields in the simulated population were used to estimate lactation yields for each cow. This was done by fitting Wood’s lactation curve model using the nonlinear mixed effects model by the nlme() function of R Version 3.0.2 []. The fitting process and lactation yield estimation followed the processes outlined by Raadsma et al. []. This resulted in a lactation yield estimate for each cow  using Wood’s model based on TD records from the TDSR (). Step 4: For every TDSR  the mean square error of prediction (MSEP) was calculated using the following formula: where  is the number of simulated lactation yields. Step 5: The 25 different TDSR that contained each TD were averaged to yield a single average MSEP for each TD. Using this value  each TD from the pool was ranked from the highest MSEP (most inaccurate) to the lowest. Step 6: One-quarter of the TD with the most inaccurate average MSEP were removed from the pool. This reduced the pool of TD for the next loop to theoretically include TD that on average allow for more accurate estimation of lactation yield. This loop process can theoretically continue until the number of TD in the pool is less than the number of TD () per TDSR. It was expected that the MSEP would initially reduce as the size of the pool decreased but then either reach a plateau or increase again  i.e. decrease in accuracy. For the purposes of this study  the looping process was repeated ten times  when the pool had only 20 DIM remaining. The methods used to estimate lactation were compared in three ways: (1) MSEP between true and estimated lactation yield  (2) comparison of EBV based on true lactation yield and estimated lactation yield and (3) number of sires that could be theoretically tested for a given number of test-day recordings. More detailed descriptions of these comparisons are given below. First  the simulated lactation yields were compared directly with the various estimates of lactation yield using the MSEP. Simulated lactation yields () were compared with the estimates obtained with methods based on fewer TD records. This included the estimation methods already described () and additionally  the TIM at the different TDSR () and the Wood method at the equally spaced sampling regimes (    ). Using the estimates of lactation yield  MSEP were calculated (similarly to that described in equation ()) and used to compare the accuracy of the different lactation yield estimation methods. Second  the predicted EBV from each method were compared with the ‘true’ EBV based on the simulated data. EBV for each cow were calculated based on the lactation yield estimates using the TIM (      ) and the Wood method (      ). These EBV were calculated in ASReml-R Discovery Edition 1.0 []  using the  matrix based on the LPRI pedigree data. The EBV based on the simulated data using the true lactation yields () were also calculated (EBV). EBV of the different lactation yield estimation methods were compared by using the number of cows in the top 100 EBV that corresponded with the ‘true’ top 100 EBV (Top100). This enabled an assessment of the similarities between methods to estimate lactation yield in terms of the cows that would be theoretically selected. Lastly  the number of sires that could theoretically be progeny-tested was used as a comparison to determine which method could use allocated resources most efficiently. According to the method outlined by Duclos et al. []  the theoretical reliability () of a sire can be calculated as: where  is the heritability of    is the number of daughters and  is the phenotypic variance of . The  represents the increase in the residual variance due to the TDSR recording protocol and can be calculated as the variance of the differences between the estimated yield under the TDSR recording protocol    and yield under a full recording protocol    Using these equations and simple algebra  an expression can be developed to determine the theoretical number of daughters necessary to prove a sire with a specific reliability level. Then  the number of sires that could possibly be proven given a limited number of resources can be calculated and compared according to the method used to estimate lactation yield. In Pakistan  the current Sahiwal progeny testing system (not including government farms) records data monthly from approximately 30 private farms  which we assumed  had 25 milking animals each. This means that 7500 (30<U+2009>×<U+2009>25<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) TD records can be collected within a given lactation. Thus  the number of possible proven sires is equal to: where  is the number of TD recorded per lactation and  is the number of daughters necessary (calculated using equation ()) to prove a sire with a given reliability () and  based on the method of lactation yield estimation. TDSR selection and comparison were done separately for the two lactation curve shapes (APHP and HPLP) and for  recorded TD (where  is equal to 4  5 or 6) within a lactation. This allows for comparison of the key outcomes and practical applications of these results based on both shape of the lactation curve and the number of TD recorded. Selection of the TDSR to be compared within this study was done using a process that removed DIM with each loop in order to reduce the number of possible combinations of TDSR while maintaining the DIM that contributed to accurate estimates of lactation yield using Wood’s model. We can test the efficacy of this process by examining the trend of the median MSEP of all the TDSR tested within each loop (Figure ). These plots show that  in general  the median MSEP decreased with each subsequent loop. However  this was not the case when the shape of the curves were APHP and  = 4 TD  for which a small increase in the median MSEP was observed (Figure a). The general downward trend of the median MSEP with each loop shows that  overall  the accuracy of the TDSR improved with an increasing number of loops. However  this does not necessarily mean that the TDSR with the lowest MSEP will be in the last loop because the TDSR were chosen at random from the remaining pool of TD in each loop. Thus  it is possible to randomly choose the TDSR with the lowest MSEP in the earlier loops  although this is not very likely because there are more DIM to choose from.  Plot  shows the trend for the simulated lactations with an average peak and high persistency  APHP and  for the simulated lactations with a high peak and low persistency  HPLP; the symbols represent the number () of TD per lactation used to estimate the lactation yield  where <U+25A1> is for  = 4  o for  = 5 and <U+0394> for  = 6; the regression lines show the trend of median MSEP values from loop 1 through to loop 10. The key question in this study was how lactation yields estimated with Wood’s model [] using fewer TD records compare with estimates from the recommended TIM method []. The plots in Figure  show the distribution of the MSEP values for the TDSR using four  five or six TD to estimate lactation yield. Lower values of MSEP indicate more accurate estimates of lactation yield.  The probability density plots are shown separately for random selections of test-day (TD) sampling regimes of 4  5 and 6 TD per lactation; plot  shows the trend for the simulated lactations with an average peak and high persistency (APHP) and  for the simulated lactations with a high peak and low persistency (HPLP); the line type represents the number () of TD per lactation used to estimate the lactation yield  where dotted (•••) is for  = 4  solid (<U+2015>) for  = 5 and dashed (---) for  = 6. The TDSR method based on six TD per lactation resulted in comparable estimates of lactation yield as the TIM with monthly records  which had MSEP values of 12 385 (APHP) and 13 587 (HPLP)  as shown in Table . This is indicated in Figure a and b by the location of the left-tail of the dashed MSEP curve ( = 6)  which indicates that a small proportion of the TDSR tested had MSEP values that were less than or equal to the MSEP for the TIM monthly estimates. Similarly  the position of all three probability density plots show that the use of Wood’s model with  TD (where  = 4  5 or 6) to estimate lactation yield produced more accurate estimates than the TIM with quarterly records (MSEP values; 43 621 for APHP and 71 631 for HPLP) but less accurate estimates than TIM with weekly records (MSEP values; 2936 for APHP and 3112 for HPLP). The accuracy of lactation yield estimates  measured by the MSEP  is an important parameter to compare different methods of estimation. However  an easier to apply measure when dealing with animal selection is to determine the correspondence of the rankings of EBV calculated using the alternate methods compared with the ‘true’ EBV rankings based on the simulated lactation yields. Figure  shows the distribution of the number of cows in the top 100 EBV that corresponded with the ‘true’ top 100 EBV. In this figure  values closer to 100 are considered more accurate.  Plot  shows the trend for the simulated lactations with an average peak and high persistency (APHP) and  for the simulated lactations with a high peak and low persistency (HPLP); the line type represents the number () of TD per lactation used to estimate the lactation yield  where dotted (•••) is for  = 4  solid (<U+2015>) for  = 5 and dashed (---) for  = 6. In both Figure a and b  the probability density plots show that there was a large proportion of TDSR that had greater Top100 values than the estimates with the TIM based on quarterly records (Table ; APHP - 73  HPLP - 77) and to a lesser extent the monthly records (Table ; APHP - 85  HPLP - 88). As the number () of TD recorded per lactation increased  the proportion of TDSR that had a greater correspondence with the ‘true’ EBV rankings also increased compared to estimates obtained based on monthly records. This was even truer when the graph shape showed a rapid decline (HPLP) as compared to a slow decline (APHP). The median values for the probability density plots are in Figure  and Table . Results in Table  show that  as the frequency of recording increased  the median MSEP decreased. Similarly  as the median MSEP decreased the correspondence between the EBV rankings and ‘true’ EBV rankings increased. The values of the Top100 corresponding animals show that using four  five or six TD  strategically timed throughout lactation  allowed for the selection of animals that aligned better with the ‘true’ EBV than the ‘TIM Quarterly’ regime and in some cases the ‘TIM Monthly’ regime. Another measure that can be used to compare methods is the correlation of the resulting EBV with the ‘true’ EBV. For the APHP curves using four  five or six TD  these correlations were equal to 0.882  0.905 and 0.923  respectively. For the HPLP curves  correlations were equal to 0.931  0.947 and 0.959. These values concur with the trends seen in the Top100 values but give a more direct indication of the potential amount of genetic gain lost because of using fewer TD per lactation. By applying selection index theory  the EBV results can be further extrapolated for application within a progeny-testing situation. Table  shows the bias and  of the different methods to estimate lactation yield. The  is the standard deviation of the deviations between true and estimated lactation yields using equation ()  whereas the bias is the mean of the differences between true and estimated lactation yields  (<U+2009>-<U+2009>). The resulting values of  were used in equation () to calculate the number of daughters necessary to prove a sire with a reliability of 50%. Subsequently  assuming that a given amount of TD recording resources was available  the number of possible sires that could be tested was determined using equation (). Results show that accuracy of the lactation yield estimate tended to increase as the number of TD per lactation increased. Hence  with the more accurate methods to estimate lactation yield  fewer daughters were required to prove a sire with a given reliability. However  the results also indicate that  with limited resources  the more frequent TD sampling reduced the number of sires that could be proven. Using the MSEP values from the simulation study  an ideal sampling regime for collecting TD records can be recommended. The accuracy of lactation yield estimates and subsequent EBV predictions with the TDSR evaluated varied greatly. To develop possible recommendations for sampling regimes  a criterion was established to subset the TDSR into those that were accurate enough for selection and those that were not. For this study  the criterion was set such that the estimation method had to have over 80 animals in the top 100 ranked EBV which corresponded with the ‘true’ EBV ranks. Of all the TDSR tested with  = 4 TD within a lactation  18.1% of the APHP and 63.9% HPLP shaped curves met this criteria. Figure  shows the distribution of the sampling days (one to four) for the TDSR that met these criteria. Similar figures could be produced for  = 5 and  = 6 as well  but for the purposes of the discussion we will focus on  = 4. Figure  shows that it was necessary to have the first TD early in lactation  around the peak of lactation (where the average peak occurs at 34 DIM for APHP and 35 DIM for HPLP).  These plots show distributions of the sampling protocols for the TDSR with four TD per lactation and have over 80 of their top 100 ranked animals in common with the ‘true’ EBV ranks; plot  shows the distributions for the average peak high persistency simulations and  shows those for the high peak  low persistence simulations; the values in brackets on the plots for each of the four TD show the range of the middle 25% of DIM for each distribution. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit tests []  the distributions from Figure  were shown to differ significantly from the distributions of  = 4 order statistics from a uniform (0 280) distribution (all  <10). Therefore  the results from this study suggest that strategically timing TD sampling throughout the lactation yielded more accurate estimates of lactation yield than random (uniform) sampling. This study investigated methods to estimate lactation yield more accurately in a developing dairy sector where resources for data collection and progeny-testing are limited. The focus was to investigate estimation methods using fewer  yet more strategic  TD sampling regimes and to propose a methodology to progeny-test bulls for milk production when milk recording is limited. The two key comparisons were: (1) the TIM with Wood’s lactation curve model and (2) TD recording regimes with equal intervals (weekly  monthly and quarterly) with TD recording regimes with four  five or six records per lactation more strategically placed throughout lactation. The MSEP results (Table ) show that in all cases  the TIM had higher MSEP than the corresponding recording regime using the Wood model with differences ranging from 5% (HPLP-Weekly) to more than double (for HPLP-Quarterly). This suggests that estimating lactation yield with the Wood model is more accurate than with the TIM. Therefore  if genetic gain was predicted based on the accuracy of EBV from this analysis  using the Wood model would be superior. However  the differences between the estimation methods are not as large based on the corresponding Top100 values  which were either the same or differed by only one or two animals ranked in the top 100  with a maximum difference of 5 for HPLP-Quarterly. This suggests that the TIM and Wood model methods ranked the animals similarly for selection purposes and hence genetic progress would be essentially the same  regardless of the method. Although the selection outcomes of the TIM and Wood model estimation methods may be the same  if we extrapolate this information further  the difference in the accuracy of the estimation will have an effect in the long-term. Based on theoretical calculations  the Wood model estimation method can prove more sires (Table ) than the TIM with the same TD sampling regime. Therefore  for a given TD sampling regime  we would expect the Wood model method to yield more accurate lactation yield estimates and hence use the available resources more efficiently. Nonetheless  it should be noted that nonlinear models other than the Wood model may also be appropriate. The main consideration here was to adopt a model with relatively few parameters  bearing in mind the relatively small number of observations () per lactation. With regard to the number of TD recorded per lactation  the results in Table  show that as the number of records within lactation decreased  the residual standard deviation () of the bias in the estimation method increased consistent with other studies [] []. Using this  value and equations () and ()  we can determine the theoretical number of daughters required to prove a sire to attain a reliability () of 50% (Table ). These results show that as  increases  more daughters are required to prove a sire with a given reliability. Despite this  recording fewer TD per lactation provides an opportunity to record more cows with the same resources allocated to the progeny-testing system (Table ). Thus  recording regimes with fewer TD per lactation and using the Wood model method to estimate lactation yield are the most efficient in terms of use of the resources. The implications of this to the overall outcome of the progeny-testing program is a greater pool of progeny-tested sires to select from  which means that genetic gain can be increased by increasing selection intensity. Duclos et al. []  using similar calculations  also concluded that more animals can be tested by using fewer TD records in a lactation  without affecting the reliability of the bulls’ EBV. The novelty of this study lies in the testing of different strategically placed TDSR  with the aim of finding TDSR that provide the most accurate lactation yield estimates and the highest accuracy to select animals. The purpose of the loops and selection process for the TDSR was to find these ‘ideal’ recording regimes. The results of this study show that more DIM are required in the earlier portion of the lactation than in the latter portion. This agrees with the idea discussed in previous research that suggests the earlier portion of lactation is more difficult to model than the later portion [] []. Looking at all the TDSR tested and their lactation yield estimates  Figure  shows the median MSEP from each loop. The general trend of both these plots (for APHP and HPLP) is that the median MSEP decreased with each loop. This suggests that as the loop process continues  it is testing TDSR that allow for more accurate lactation yield estimates and hence is more likely to find the ‘ideal’ TDSR. Despite the positive outcomes of the loop process and the selection of superior TDSR  a number of issues must be considered. First  in reality  each cow has a different recording regime since not all cows will give birth at the same time. Furthermore  data collection occurs at different farms at different times. Therefore  even if one ‘ideal’ TDSR was found  it would be difficult to implement that precise recording regimen. Therefore  a more realistic outcome of this research is to develop recommendations about possible ranges of TD sampling times that yield ‘good’ estimates of lactation. Figure  shows the distribution of the four TD of the TDSR tested with over 80 animals in the top 100 ranked EBV which corresponded with the ‘true’ EBV ranks. The distribution and intersection of these curves indicate that there is a range for each TD  which  if followed  allows for adequate lactation yield estimation. The ranges shown in Figure  suggest that  although the frequency of TD in the later stages of lactation was not as high  it is important to have TD both pre-peak and post-peak lactation. Other studies have reported similar results  which suggest that the first TD should be recorded early in lactation [] and post-peak sampling is important in the estimation procedure []. There is evidence to suggest that unequal intervals between TD lead to more biased estimates than equidistant records []. However  this study has completed a more thorough and direct comparison of these differences and found that unequal TD sampling intervals strategically placed throughout the lactation can provide less biased lactation yield estimates. The simulation process used in this study assumed a lactation length of 280 days and an approximate heritability for cumulative milk yield of 0.2 (see Additional file ). These values were used to ensure that the simulated lactations were similar to those of the Sahiwal population in Pakistan. If a longer lactation length (for example  305 days) was used  the only difference  if any  could be slight changes in the recommended timeframes from which one should take TD samples (Figure ). This is because  although the overall ‘length’ of the lactation would be longer  the key characteristics of the curve (peak  inflection) would not change and so the ‘ideal’ TD sampling times  which presumably revolve around these characteristics  would also not change. With regard to heritability  if for example  a higher heritability was used  partitioning of variation in the raw estimates of the parameters of the Wood model between polygenic random effects and cow-specific “environmental” random effects would be different (see Additional file ). This would lead to simulated lactation curves that would be more similar than the lactation curves simulated in this study. The implications of this could lead to lower MSPE values in all TDSR  but the general comparative differences and recommendations would ultimately be expected to be the same. It can be argued that the use of TDM or daily milk yields would be beneficial in developing progeny-testing systems since it would allow for the inclusion of unfinished lactations and handle the analysis of lactations with few records []. Several publications suggest that TDM can supersede selection based on even completed lactation yields [] [] because with improved statistical methods  both environmental and genetic effects [] [] are better accounted for and can yield more precise definitions of contemporary groups and stage of lactation []-[]. However  for these methods to be effective  accurate estimates of genetic and phenotypic parameters are required [] [] which are difficult to obtain in developing countries [] because in many cases field recording is inefficient and poor []. Research on data from Pakistan shows that TDM could be used [] but this was based on a limited dataset. In the future  as more TD data become available electronically  the use of a fixed regression TDM could be a viable option. Furthermore  if TD are strategically placed  as suggested in this study  it could aid in the estimation of the parameters that describe the lactation curve shape in the fixed regression TDM. However  due to the current level of recording and electronic data entry  this study did not consider a TDM suitable for the Pakistani situation and instead looked at various approaches for which lactation yield is first estimated and subsequently used for breeding value estimation. The results of this study show that using Wood’s model to estimate lactation yield is more accurate than the TIM  although selection outcomes in terms of the ranking of EBV were very similar. Results also show that using few TD records (say four  five or six TD within one lactation) that are more strategically placed throughout lactation can produce more accurate estimates of lactation yield than a quarterly recording regime and have the potential to be as accurate as a monthly recording regime. Lastly  although using fewer TD causes an increase in the residual standard deviation for the lactation yield estimate  they provide an opportunity to progeny-test more sires and thus for a more efficient use of the allocated resources. Although this study was based on data from Sahiwal cattle in Pakistan  these recommendations can be applied to any dairy breed with similar lactation curve characteristics.

This work provides an accurate tool to determine  the amount of data required to estimate a genetic correlation between traits measured on distinct individuals  such as the purebred-crossbred genetic correlation. The additive genetic correlation is a key parameter in livestock genetic improvement and is defined as the correlation between breeding values of individuals for two distinct traits  say  and []  where  denotes the covariance between the breeding values  and  of individuals  and  and  the additive genetic standard deviations. Estimation of  requires substantial amounts of data []-[]. The standard error (SE) of the estimated genetic correlation depends on whether both traits are recorded on the same individual or on distinct individuals []. Examples of cases where both traits are recorded on distinct individuals are: (i) traits that are expressed in different environments  where  is a measure of the degree of genotype-by-environment interaction  (ii) traits that are expressed in males . females  such as sperm quality in bulls and milk yield in cows  (iii) traits that are expressed in live  dead animals  such as meat quality traits in fattening pigs and longevity of sows  and (iv) traits that are expressed in purebreds . crossbreds. This work considers the SE of the estimated genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals  with a focus on the purebred-crossbred genetic correlation. In crossbreeding schemes  the ultimate goal is to improve the performance of the crossbred offspring of the pure breeding lines. With genotype-by-environment interaction and/or non-additive genetic effects  purebred performance is an imperfect predictor of crossbred performance. Thus  selection in crossbreeding schemes is ideally based on information recorded on crossbred relatives of the purebred selection candidates  or on a genomic reference population based on crossbred phenotypes []-[]. However  phenotypic and pedigree data are not always routinely collected on crossbred individuals. The genetic correlation between the purebred and the crossbred trait () is the key parameter that determines the need for crossbred information. Hence  accurate estimation of [] [] is required to decide on the strategy used for data recording. A priori  the desired accuracy of an estimate of  should be at least as high as for an ordinary genetic correlation. For example  when accuracies of purebred and crossbred EBV (estimated breeding values) are similar  the loss in response to selection due to relying on purebred rather than crossbred information is ~10% when  is 0.9  but ~30% when  is 0.7. To accurately identify such differences in   the SE of the estimated correlation should not be greater than ~0.05. Predicting the SE of estimates of the genetic correlation has been studied for many years []-[] []. In particular  Robertson [] considered the SE of estimates of the genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals  such as []  but only for cases with equal heritabilities and equal numbers of offspring for both traits. Moreover  the reports in []-[] [] all considered half-sib designs  and did not allow for full-sib groups within half-sib families or for common-litter environmental effects. In addition  existing prediction equations may not be readily accessible to applied breeders  because the full predictions are complex and expressed in terms of intra-class correlations  rather than heritabilities and common-litter variances. Simplified expressions do exist  but express the SE as being proportional to  and are very inaccurate when  is close to 1  which may often be the case for a genotype-by-environment correlation or purebred-crossbred correlation [] [] []. With the computing power available today  stochastic simulations offer a solution  but they are still too time-consuming to use as a simple interactive tool. Thus  although the topic is somewhat outdated  for applied breeding it is still relevant to propose a simple prediction of the SE of estimates of genetic correlations. Moreover  while the use of crossbred phenotypes has been limited in applied breeding programs because tracing pedigree relationships in a crossbred production environment is not trivial  it has recently regained attention because genomic relations are a solution for the cumbersome pedigree tracing process. The idea that building a training dataset with crossbred phenotypes will permit selection for crossbred performance is attractive and has revived interest in using crossbred phenotypes. Here  we present a simple prediction equation for the SE of the estimated genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals  for nested full-half sib schemes with common-litter effects. This expression allows  optimization of designs that aim at estimating . To facilitate application  an R-script that implements the prediction is included in Additional file . Examples of sample sizes required to estimate  are provided for a number of practical cases  but optimization of schemes is not considered extensively  since it can be easily done for specific cases using the R-script. In the following  purebred and crossbred performance will be used as an example of two traits recorded on distinct individuals. Hence  subscript   referring to purebred  will be used to denote one trait  and subscript   referring to crossbred  to denote the other. However  the resulting expression will apply to the general case of a genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals. Consider a population with phenotypic records on purebred and crossbred offspring of  sires. Each sire was mated to  dams of its own line  each dam producing  purebred offspring  and to  dams of the other line  each dam producing  crossbred offspring. Thus  a half-sib structure is present between purebreds and crossbreds  whereas full-sib families are nested within half-sib families within the purebreds and within the crossbreds. For both purebreds and crossbreds  the trait model is given by: where  denotes the breeding value   the common-litter effect  and  the environmental effect for trait  (purebred or crossbred). Hence  it is assumed implicitly that fixed effects can be estimated accurately. We do not model permanent environmental effects. Hence  a single observation per individual and a single litter per dam are assumed. The estimate of the purebred-crossbred genetic correlation is given by: where  denotes the estimate of the purebred-crossbred genetic covariance  and  and  the estimates of genetic standard deviations. Throughout this article  symbols with hats (^) denote estimates  which are random variables  while symbols without hats denote the true parameters. The standard error of  was derived using a Taylor-series expansion of the expression for . The final result is presented in the main text  while derivations are in Additional file . The resulting expression shows that the SE of the estimate of the purebred-crossbred genetic correlation is determined by the true value of   the number of sire families    and the reliabilities of sire EBV  where  is the reliability (  squared accuracy) of sire EBV for purebred performance  and  the reliability of sire EBV for crossbred performance. Reliabilities of EBV are given by: where  denotes the average phenotypic value of the progeny of a sire with a variance equal to: where  denotes the common-litter variance and  the environmental variance. Thus  Equations  and  are used twice  once for purebreds and once for crossbreds. Instead of using Equations  and   empirical reliabilities from genetic evaluations  when available  can be substituted into Equation . In the limiting case where the number of dams mated to a sire and the number of offspring per dam are large  so that   the expression reduces to: which is the common expression for the SE of a simple correlation coefficient []. A limited number of scenarios was tested by estimation of  in simulated data using ReML [] and compared to results from analysis of the data using random-effects ANOVA with dam families nested within sire families [] and to predictions from Equation . The simulated data consisted of sires with purebred and crossbred offspring. Crossbred offspring were from F1 females mated to a terminal sire line  i.e.  three purebred lines were simulated  each with an  of 100. For each purebred line  10 generations of pedigree were used. Purebred and crossbred phenotypes were simulated from multivariate normal distributions  for different values of     and . Genetic correlations were estimated with the ASReml software []  using 200 replicates per scenario. Average  as reported by ASReml and the standard deviation of  over the 200 replicates were calculated. A large number of simulated scenarios was tested using ANOVA and compared to predictions from Equation . One thousand replicates of all factorial combinations of  = (50  150)   = 10         = (-0.8  -0.4  0  0.4  0.8)       and  were simulated (320 scenarios in total). Genetic parameters were estimated using ANOVA. Estimates of  outside the boundaries of -1 and 1 were set to the nearest boundary. Concordance between the ReML and ANOVA estimates from the simulations was very high (Table ). The SE from the ReML analyses were a little lower than the SE from the ANOVA estimates  which was expected because the ReML estimates used 10 generations of pedigree information  whereas the ANOVA estimates were based on a family structure of a single generation. Moreover  the SE of the ReML estimates were less precisely estimated because of the limited number of replicates (See footnote of Table ). Because of computation time  more extensive evaluation of the accuracy of predictions from Equation  was based on the ANOVA estimates. ANOVA estimates showed that the predicted SE from Equation  were accurate since the average absolute relative error across all schemes evaluated was equal to 3.2% (=100% × |predicted SE-simulated SE|/simulated SE; [see Additional file ]). Sizeable errors occurred only for schemes for which estimates of genetic variances were near 0 in some replicates  which yielded extreme values for  (this occurred occasionally for schemes with  =50   and ). For those schemes  the maximum absolute relative error was 14%. These schemes are  however  of little practical relevance since their  was around 0.25  which is far too high to be useful in practice. Figure  shows predictions of  based on Equation  as a function of  for a sample size of 100 sires  and for different reliabilities of sire EBV. When sire EBV have high reliability   becomes considerably smaller when  comes closer to 1. However  when sire EBV are inaccurate there is only a weak relationship between  and . Clearly  a sample of 100 half-sib families is too small  unless reliabilities of sire EBV are close to 1 and  is greater than ~0.7.   For  =100. The figure is symmetric in   so the range for  = -1 to 0 is omitted.  was based on Equation . Figure  shows predictions of  as a function of the number of half-sib families  for a range of schemes that may represent practical cases (personal communication Egiel Hanenberg  Gosse Veninga  Hooi Ling Khaw and Jeroen Visscher). Results from aquaculture breeding programs  such as for Tilapia  show that the commonly used strategy of mating a sire to only two dams  together with the presence of common full-sib family effects  causes very large standard errors  even when 600 half-sib families are used. On the contrary  the use of large numbers of dams per sire in broiler chicken breeding causes standard errors to approach their theoretical minimum (Equation ).    were based on Equation  with the following input values: Harvest weight in aquaculture (tilapia):  = 2   = 40   = 0.3   = 0.15   = 0.8. Egg number in laying hens:  = 7       = 0.2   = 0   = 0.6. Growth rate in pigs:  = 10   = 10   = 0.3   = 0.10   = 0.7. Growth rate in broilers:  = 12       = 0.3   = 0.05   = 0.8. Minimum: Lowest possible  for  = 0.7 refers to a scheme with many dams per sire and many offspring per dam. The main objective of this work was to provide breeders with a simple tool to predict the SE of estimates of the genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals (). The objective was not to address theoretical issues underlying the SE of genetic correlation estimates  which have been discussed extensively in the past []-[] []. Nevertheless  this work provides new insight on the impact of the reliability of sire EBV on   which was not obvious from previous work. Equation  shows that  depends on the reliabilities of sire EBV and the true value of . Since Equation  is expressed in terms of reliabilities  it probably extends to other models for trait analysis  such as repeatability models  but this was not validated by simulation. On the one hand  Equation  can be interpreted as a lower bound of  because it assumes a balanced design and that the fixed effects are known  while actual estimation of  always involves somewhat unbalanced data and estimation of fixed effects. However  on the other hand  Equation  assumes that  is estimated from half-sib relationships only  whereas estimation of genetic parameters in livestock populations usually includes multiple generations of pedigree information  so that more distant relationships also contribute to the estimate  which reduces the SE. We have considered a genetic correlation between traits measured on distinct individuals  of which the genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred performance    is an important example. When both traits are measured on the same individuals  additional complications arise due to covariances between the dam  common-litter and residual effects for the two traits. In such a case  derivation of  for a nested full-half sib scheme with common-litter effects is complicated  and this was not attempted here. When both traits are measured on the same individuals  stochastic simulation results (not shown) indicate that  is similar to the value given by Equation  when  = 0  but smaller than that value when the true correlation differs from 0. Hence  in most cases  the SE of a genetic correlation between traits measured on the same individuals is smaller than the value obtained from Equation . Based on Robertson’s results []  Falconer and Mackay [] presented a simplified prediction of   taking the form   where  is a function of the data structure and heritabilities. For  = ± 1  this expression yields   which is very inaccurate unless the reliabilities of sire EBV are close to 1 (Figure ). For  <U+2192> 1 and equal reliabilities of sire EBV for both traits  Equation  reduces to: which does not approach 0 unless reliabilities approach 1 (see values for  = 1 in Figure ). This paper presents a simple and accurate prediction of the standard error of estimates of the genetic correlation between traits recorded on distinct individuals  for nested full-half sibs schemes with common-litter effects. This allows breeders to decide on the required sample size to estimate this correlation    to support decisions on the collection of crossbred information. Results show that more than 100 half sib families are required in most cases. PB and JB together conceived the study. PB derived the mathematical results and drafted the initial manuscript.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an infectious chronic respiratory disease caused by  Infection of livestock with bTB has an estimated global cost of €2 billion annually []  due mostly to the lack of bTB control in developing countries  where infection is endemic  resulting in reduced productivity of livestock. The primary cost of bTB infection in developed countries is the control of bTB  with estimated spends by the Irish and UK governments in 2010 and 2011 of €63 million and €179 million []  respectively. Bovine tuberculosis is ranked as the fourth most important livestock disease globally []  primarily due to its importance in developing countries. Eradication of bTB from cattle herds has been successful in some countries such as Australia and throughout Scandinavia. Epidemiological circumstances in developed countries where bTB is present vary. The UK and Ireland have yet to gain an official bTB free status []  although both countries introduced eradication programs during the late 1950s. In the UK  bTB is an expanding epidemic  while in Ireland  it forms a stable endemic with substantial year-on-year reductions  particularly recently []. A compulsory bTB eradication program for cattle was introduced in Ireland in the late 1950s. The initial response was rapid but by the mid-1960s  with the number of animal infections per year in excess of 30 000 []. In recent years  the number of animal infections has decreased to less than 20 000 per year; however  progress towards a bTB free status in Ireland remains slow [] []. When the eradication program began in the late 1950s  confirmed animal infection prevalence was 17%; in 2003  this prevalence was 0.4% []. Re-emergences of bTB have been reported in France and Spain []-[]  with concerns that bTB could expand into neighbouring countries []. The existence of wildlife reservoirs for bTB is a major contributing factor to the continued infection of bTB in livestock. In Ireland and the UK  cattle share their environment with wild badger () populations in which bTB is endemic []. The badger acts as a natural reservoir for the disease []. Wildlife reservoirs for bTB in other countries include wild boar and deer in Spain  brush-tailed possums in New Zealand  and white tailed deer in Michigan  USA. Genetic selection for bTB resistance could be incorporated into current cattle breeding programs in Ireland to enhance the national eradication strategy. However  this approach requires information on the extent of genetic variation for bTB susceptibility within the Irish cattle herd. Heritability for susceptibility to  infection has previously been documented to be 0.18 in both Irish [] and UK dairy herds []. However  these studies were confined to dairy cattle and  to date  no study has been undertaken on beef cattle. Moreover  the potential of genotype by environment (GxE) effects for susceptibility to  infection between herds of different disease prevalence levels has not been quantified. The objective of the present study was to estimate variance components for bTB susceptibility in both dairy and beef cattle and to quantify whether GxE for bTB susceptibility exists across environments that differ in bTB prevalence. In the present study  tuberculin skin test results from both dairy and beef cattle were used as a measure of bTB susceptibility. The variance components estimated in this study are needed to derive multi-breed estimated breeding values (EBV) for bTB resistance in national genetic evaluations. As well as being useful for incorporation into breeding programs  these EBV could also be useful phenotypes for subsequent genomic analysis. Ireland has operated a compulsory bTB eradication program since the late 1950s. The current national program consists of a mandatory registration system for herds  an individual bovine identification system  a computerised movement monitoring system  an animal health computer system  as well as a comprehensive program of disease surveillance and control. Two forms of surveillance are used in Ireland. Field surveillance for bTB is performed annually in each herd through the routine use of the single intra-dermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) [] []. Testing is carried out by veterinarians approved by the Irish Department of Agriculture  Food and the Marine. In addition  abattoir surveillance is conducted on all animals at slaughter  relying on the gross examination of each carcass by an approved veterinarian for pathology suggestive of bTB. Field surveillance using the SICTT involves intradermal injection of bovine tuberculin (a purified protein derived from ) into the neck of the animal. This inoculate will cause an immune reaction to the tuberculin in animals that are sensitised to antigens in bovine tuberculin and results in an inflammatory response and localised swelling at the injection site that reaches its greatest intensity 48 to 72 h post-injection. To distinguish animals infected with different strains of  from those infected with   animals are also injected at a different site with avian tuberculin (from ). The outcome of the SICTT is determined by the relative difference in the thickness of skin-folds in reaction to the bovine and avian tuberculins. Using the so-called standard interpretation (as would be used in herds with bTB free status that can  therefore  be traded without restrictions)  if the relative bovine-avian difference in skin-fold test is greater than 4 mm  the animal is considered a `standard reactor’  if between 1 and 4 mm  a `standard inconclusive reactor’  and otherwise  a `non-reactor’ []. Inconclusive reactors are re-tested 60 days after the initial test. Post-mortem examinations and/or laboratory culture of tissue samples can be used to confirm the presence of bTB in reactors. A herd loses its official bTB free status if at least one reactor is detected; movement of animals from the herd is restricted. Subsequently  infected animals are removed for slaughter and further SICTT testing is conducted at approximately two-month intervals  until two consecutive clear herd tests (i.e.  herd tests with no positive or inconclusive reactors disclosed) are achieved  at which point herd bTB-free status is regained. In restricted herds  a lower threshold (so-called  severe interpretation) of the SICTT is used  such that all animals with a bovine-avian difference of at least 2 mm are considered a `reactor under severe interpretation’ and animals with a bovine reaction less than 2 mm greater than an avian tuberculin reaction are considered an `inconclusive reactor under severe interpretation’. Additional skin tests are always undertaken on herds that are contiguous to  or otherwise linked to  infected herds  and in herds that are located in 'at-risk' areas. Herds are also re-tested for bTB six months after they have re-gained bTB free status. In the present study  a `herd-episode of bTB infection’ refers to the full period of herd restriction triggered by disclosure of bTB infection within a herd []. The herd-episode starts with the disclosure or discovery of at least one infected animal (from either field or abattoir surveillance) and ends immediately following two consecutive clear herd tests at approximately two-month intervals. In the present study  herd-episodes were only included in the analysis if at least two standard reactors were detected from field surveillance  of which at least one had to be home-born. Herd-episodes with ten reactors or more were only included if at least 20% of the reactors  based on SICTT results  presented bTB lesions postmortem from abattoir testing. Tuberculin skin test results from 22 381 herd-episodes in 16 717 dairy  beef and mixed herds were collected between 2001 and 2010  inclusive. Herds were classified as either dairy  beef or mixed  determined by the average breed composition of cows in each herd. Herds were defined as dairy herds if the average breed composition of that herd was =90% dairy breed  while herds were defined as beef herds if the average breed composition of that herd was =30% beef breed. All other herds were defined as mixed herds. The total number of breeds represented across all herd-episodes was 35  with the mean number of breeds per herd-episode being 2.3; 5571 herd-episodes had more than one breed present during a herd-episode  across both dairy and beef herds. Only positive and inconclusive results were recorded in the database. During these herd-episodes  there were a total of 183 955 `standard reactors’ and `reactors under severe interpretation’  20 884 `standard inconclusive reactors’  and 1896 `inconclusive reactors under severe interpretation’. Confirmed bTB lesions were identified in 50 614 reactors from postmortem examinations and/or tissue culture samples. The national animal identification and movement system  which monitors animal movements in and out of herds  was used to identify animals present in herds at the time of testing. In total  1 357 791 animals were present during herd-episodes but did not test positive or inconclusive for bTB. Animals were only included if they had moved into a herd more than six weeks prior to the start of a herd-episode. In the present study  only `standard reactors’ and `reactors under severe interpretation’ were considered to be infected with bTB; thus the inconclusive reactors were removed from the dataset. Animals with no recorded sire were discarded. Animal age at the start of each herd-episode was determined. Female animals that were more than 30 months old or had calved at least once by the start of the herd-episode were classified as cows  and otherwise as heifers. Male animals that were less than 36 months at the start of the herd-episode were classified as steers (i.e.  castrated bulls)  and otherwise as bulls. Due to the paucity of data (n = 1822)  bulls were subsequently discarded from the dataset. The final dataset consisted of 21 872 steers  105 914 cows and 56 904 heifers; of these  22 573 were reactors and 162 117 were nonreactors. Considerable cross-breeding exists in Irish herds. For example  58% of herd-episodes in beef herds contained animals with direct dairy ancestry. Many cows in beef herds are first or second crosses from dairy herds. Following VanRaden and Sanders []  heterosis was calculated as   and recombination loss as   where  and  are the proportion of breed  in the sire and dam  respectively. Variance components for bTB susceptibility  as a binary trait (i.e. reactor or not reactor)  were estimated using both an animal linear mixed model and a threshold animal model in ASreml []. Variance components were estimated separately for cows  heifers  and steers  as well as within beef  dairy and all herds; the latter also included mixed herds. Fixed effects considered for inclusion in all models were herd-episode and both heterosis and recombination loss coefficients of the animal (as continuous variables). Parity (1  2  3  4  =5) and stage of lactation (0–60  61–120  121-180  181–240  241–300  >300 days) were included as fixed effects in the analysis of cows. Age (in days) was included as a covariate in the analysis of steers and heifers. Animal sex was included in models for the combined analysis of cows  heifers  and steers. Animal was included in all models as a random genetic effect and founder animals were allocated to genetic groups by breed; preliminary analysis revealed no permanent environmental effects and therefore was ignored in the analyses. Genetic correlations for bTB susceptibility between animal type (i.e.  cows  heifers  and steers) were estimated using bivariate sire models to evaluate whether bTB was genetically the same trait in the different populations. To test whether the genetic correlations between animal types differed from one  using the linear model  a likelihood ratio test was performed between each model and an analysis where the genetic correlation between animal types was constrained to be one. In addition  using the linear model  a likelihood ratio test was performed between each model and a model where the genetic variances in each animal type were constrained to be equal. Sire estimated breeding values (EBV) for bTB susceptibility were generated from the univariate animal model using only cow records. The mean EBV per breed was obtained for (1) all sires with daughter records for bTB in the data and (2) all sires with at least ten daughter records for bTB in the data. Mean EBV per year of birth was calculated to quantify genetic trends. Only sires born after 1992 were included to calculate the mean EBV per breed and genetic trends  because animals born before 1992 were too distant from the actual phenotypic data. The prevalence of bTB infection in the daughters of sires was calculated as the ratio of non-infected to infected daughters present during a herd-episode. Only sires with more than 50 daughters in more than ten herds were included in this analysis. Herd-episodes were split into four categories based on mean bTB prevalence to define different environments: very low (<0.25 prevalence)  low (0.25 to 0.50 prevalence)  high (0.50 to 0.75 prevalence) and very high (>0.75 prevalence). (Co) variance components were estimated within each environment using both linear and threshold animal models. For comparative purposes  variance components estimated using the linear animal model were also transformed to the liability scale using the standard transformation []. Genetic correlations between bTB environments were estimated using a series of bivariate sire linear models to determine whether bTB in the different environments was genetically the same trait. For the linear models  a likelihood ratio test was performed to investigate the existence of GxE by comparing the unconstrained bivariate models to a bivariate analysis where the genetic correlation between environments was constrained to one. A separate likelihood ratio test was performed for the linear models to investigate the existence of re-scaling effects between environments by comparing each bivariate model to a bivariate analysis where the variances in both environments were constrained to be equal. The mean prevalence of bTB infection in the entire dataset (cows  heifers and steers) was 0.11 (Table ). Prevalence of bTB in dairy and beef herds as well as in heifers  steers and cows is summarised in Table . The greatest prevalence of bTB infection was in cows  with a slightly greater prevalence in beef than in dairy cows. Prevalence of bTB infection was lower in heifers than in either cows or steers and was lowest in heifers from beef herds. The estimate of heritability of susceptibility to  infection for the entire dataset  using a linear model  was 0.11 (Table ). The estimate of heritability was greatest in heifers from beef herds (0.19) and lowest (0.08) in heifers from dairy herds (Table ). Estimates of heritability of susceptibility to  infection were similar for dairy and beef herds. Younger animals (i.e.  both heifers and steers) had greater heritability estimates than cows. The genetic standard deviation (SD) for susceptibility to  infection  when estimated across all animals  was 0.094 and was greatest in heifers from beef herds and lowest in heifers from dairy herds (Table ). The estimate of genetic variance for bTB susceptibility was greater in beef herds than in dairy herds (Table ) and was also greater (P <0.001) in cows than in younger animals (i.e.  heifers and steers) but did not differ between heifers and steers. Increased breed heterozygosity was associated with lower susceptibility to bTB (Table ); for example  100% heterozygosity (i.e.  a F1 crossbred) in dairy herds was associated with a 3.2% reduction in bTB prevalence. Estimates of recombination loss effects were different from zero in all sub-populations  except for the cow sub-populations  heifers in beef herds  and steers in dairy herds. Estimates of the genetic correlation for bTB susceptibility was 0.55 between cows and heifers (standard error (se) = 0.048)  0.10 between cows and steers (se = 0.104)  and 0.64 between steers and heifers (se = 0.082). The likelihood ratio test between nested models revealed that all genetic correlation estimates were significantly different from one (P <0.001). Figure  shows the mean bTB prevalence for daughters of sires with more than 50 female progeny in more than ten herds in the population under investigation. The mean bTB prevalence for daughters per sire ranged from 0.00 to 0.95. Figure  shows the mean bTB prevalence plotted against the EBV for bTB susceptibility for sires with more than 50 female progeny in more than ten herds; the correlation was 0.52.                                                                                                           From the linear model using the full dataset  Holstein-Friesian sires had the lowest mean EBV compared to all other breeds (for sires born from 1992 onwards; Table )  which indicates a reduced susceptibility to bTB. Simmental and Charolais sires had the greatest mean EBV (i.e. most susceptible to bTB infection) compared to all other breeds. The average EBV (weighted against the number of sires in each breed against the total number of sires across all breeds) in all beef breeds was 0.025 when considering sires with more than ten daughters; this was greater than the weighted average of -0.012 for all dairy breeds when considering only sires with more than ten daughters. Genetic trends for mean EBV of sires born between 1992 and 2004 are in Figure . Since 1992  the mean EBV was greater in beef sires than in dairy sires. The genetic susceptibility to bTB infection in beef and dairy animals has increased since 1999 but only the increase in dairy breeds was significantly different from zero (P <0.05).  All sires (clear dots)  sires with more than 10 daughters (solid dots)  dairy breeds (solid triangles) and beef breeds (clear triangles). Summary statistics for bTB susceptibility across different bTB prevalence categories using a linear and threshold animal model are in Table . Using a linear animal model  the estimate of heritability of susceptibility to  infection was greatest for animals in herd-episodes of very high prevalence of bTB infection (>0.75 prevalence) and lowest for those in herd-episodes of very low prevalence (<0.25 prevalence). Using a threshold animal model  the estimate of heritability was lowest for animals in herd-episodes of very low prevalence of bTB infection (<0.25 prevalence) and greatest for those in herd-episodes of very high prevalence (>0.75). The genetic SD for bTB susceptibility  estimated using the linear animal model  was lowest for the extreme bTB prevalence categories  with the genetic SD of very low (<0.25 prevalence) and very high (>0.75 prevalence) prevalence categories being approximately equal to half that of the low (0.25 to 0.5 prevalence) and high (0.5 to 0.75 prevalence) prevalence categories (Table ). The genetic SD for bTB susceptibility  estimated using the threshold animal model  increased greatly when the prevalence of bTB infection was greater than 0.75. After transforming heritability estimates from the linear model to the liability scale  heritability estimates increased as the prevalence of bTB infection increased from very low (<0.25) to very high (>0.75) prevalence  with a pronounced increase in heritability estimates in herd-episodes with a high prevalence (0.50 to 0.75) and a very high (>0.75) prevalence. Estimates of genetic correlations between susceptibility to bTB infection in different environments were all positive (Table ) and ranged from 0.06 (environments with low and very high bTB prevalence) to 0.86 (environments with low and very low bTB prevalence). All genetic correlation estimates were less than one (P <0.05) and estimates of the genetic variance in different environments also differed from each other (P <0.05) with the exception of the very low (<0.25) and high (0.5 to 0.75) bTB prevalence environments (Table ). The contribution of breeding programs to phenotypic gains in animal performance has been well documented [] []. Hence  a breeding program aimed at improving resistance to bTB can form an integral component of a national eradication program if heritable variation in bTB exists and can be exploited. The economic importance of bTB in Ireland is well established [] and the centrally stored phenotypic data on bTB status at the individual level could be used to estimate breeding values. Therefore  the objective of our study was to quantify the genetic variation of the susceptibility to bTB in cattle. A novel component of this study was the estimation of genetic variation for bTB susceptibility in beef cattle. In this study on dairy and beef cattle  a heritability of 0.11 for susceptibility to bTB was estimated using a linear model  which is between documented estimates of most production diseases (<0.05; []) and animal performance traits (~0.30; []-[]). The heritability estimates of susceptibility to bTB reported in the present study  especially those for dairy cows  are consistent with previous linear model estimates for both Irish dairy [] and UK dairy [] cows. Moreover  the reported heritability estimates of bTB  including those from the present study  are similar to those documented for paratuberculosis (i.e.  ) []-[]  which shares some epidemiological similarities with bTB []. Furthermore  our heritability estimates of susceptibility to bTB using a linear model did not vary considerably across the populations investigated (beef  dairy  cows  heifers  steers); differences in estimates were due to a combination of differences in residual and genetic variances between populations. Despite the similarities in heritability estimates among the different studies  the genetic variance estimates for susceptibility to bTB reported in the present study were two to three times greater than those documented by Bermingham et al. [] in a sub-population of the animals used in the present study (i.e. that study was limited to dairy cows and heifers). The greater genetic variance reported in the present study could be due to the greater diversity of breeds included. Our estimates of genetic variance for susceptibility to bTB were also three to six times greater than those estimated for Johne’s disease in a group of 4603 US Holstein-Friesian cows []  which was also treated as a binary trait and estimated using a linear model. Previously reported data on between-breed differences in susceptibility to bTB corroborate our results. For example  Ameni et al. [] reported a greater susceptibility and severity in the pathology of bTB in Holsteins compared to East African Zebu and Zebu-Holstein crossbreds. Other studies have also documented significant breed differences for many health traits  such as somatic cell score []  lameness [] []  and bovine respiratory disease []. The observed recent genetic trends in susceptibility to bTB (Figure ) suggest that  although the breeding goal for Irish dairy cattle is to select for longevity  fertility  and milk production []  genetic merit for resistance to bTB appears to be deteriorating in dairy cattle. Although the estimate of the genetic trend for susceptibility to bTB in beef cattle was not different from zero  genetic resistance to bTB has not improved since the 1990s (Figure ). It is therefore important to consider including resistance to bTB in the Irish national breeding goals  especially for dairy cows. Another recommendation is that other countries also evaluate genetic trends for susceptibility to bTB in their cattle populations and  where necessary  take remedial action. The contribution of breeding programs to improving genetic merit for animal health traits has been clearly documented in Scandinavian dairy cow populations [] []. In countries like Ireland  where routine testing of animals for bTB status is undertaken  it should be possible to generate accurate genetic evaluations for bTB to inform better selection decisions. Some fears have been expressed that breeding for disease resistance will lead to (or otherwise be associated with) reduced responsiveness to the SICTT. This concern was considered in detail by Bishop and Woolliams [] and they concluded there was no evidence that such a scenario would arise. The genetic variance of susceptibility to bTB in environments with different bTB prevalence levels has not previously been documented. The pattern of genetic variances of susceptibility to bTB in environments with different bTB prevalence levels  estimated using an animal linear mixed model  was similar to the trend in genetic variances estimated for somatic cell score in environments with different herd average somatic cell scores [] (i.e. it was least in the most extreme environments). However  the genetic variance pattern observed in the present study was in direct contrast to the pattern of genetic variance estimates reported for Johne’s disease in Dutch Holstein-Friesian cows []  which increased with herd prevalence for Johne’s disease. Nonetheless  the pattern in genetic variance for susceptibility to bTB when estimated with a threshold animal model in the present study was similar to that observed for Johne’s disease [] and herd prevalence (Table ). Estimates of variance components in the different prevalence groups were similar to those reported by van Hulzen et al. []  using a linear model  with the exception of the very high prevalence environment. An inverse relationship existed between estimates of genetic variance and heritability using the linear model across the different prevalence groups  while one would expect a positive relationship []. This could be due to the fewer animals in the more extreme environmental categories or selection/culling. To ensure that there was no impact of the estimation algorithm on estimates of the variance components  the zeros and ones in the high prevalence environment were switched and variance components re-estimated using the linear model; this did not impact the estimated variance components. Although heritability estimates differed between the threshold animal model and the linear model estimates transformed to the liability scale  the heritability of susceptibility to bTB in the very high prevalence herds (>0.75) was always greatest  regardless of the model used. Nonetheless  caution should be taken in interpreting the large heritability in the very high prevalence environment due to the smaller number of records. The estimates of the genetic correlation of susceptibility to bTB between cows and heifers in the present study (0.55) was similar to the estimate of 0.53 documented by Bermingham et al. [] comparing also cows and heifers. While differences in genetic variance for disease susceptibility between females and males have been documented (e.g.  for tick infection in Australian beef cattle [])  there is little information on genetic correlations for disease susceptibility between sexes. Nonetheless  estimates of genetic correlations for performance traits in different sexes have been reported. For example  Pabiou et al. [] reported genetic correlations that ranged from 0.54 to 0.81 for wholesale carcass cut traits in steers and heifers  while Stalhammar and Philipsson [] documented genetic correlations for post-weaning and weanling gain in male and female Swedish beef cattle that ranged from 0.4 to 1.0. Moreover  genetic correlations between the same performance traits for animals of different ages have also been reported; for example  genetic correlations of animal weight at weaning  post-weaning weight and weight of cows have been reported to range from 0.16 to 0.79 []. These results corroborate estimates of genetic correlations for susceptibility to bTB being less than one as documented in the present study. These less than one genetic correlations between animal types  indicates that the bTB phenotype is possibly under different genetic control in the cows  heifers  and steers. Estimates of genetic correlations of susceptibility to bTB between environments with different bTB prevalence levels were weakest for the environment with the greatest pathogen load (i.e.  >0.75 bTB prevalence). This suggests that the genetic background of susceptibility to bTB in environments under a very high pathogen load is different to that in environments under a lower pathogen load. Calus et al. [] observed a similar phenomenon when they investigated the genetics of somatic cell score in Dutch Holstein cows across environments (i.e.  herds) based on different mean bulk tank somatic cell score. Furthermore  Calus et al. [] reported the weakest genetic correlations with environments exhibiting the greatest somatic cell count. The weak genetic correlations for bTB observed in the present study with environments with the greatest prevalence of bTB could be due to the extremely high pathogen load suggesting possibly a different underlying genetic or biological systems (e.g.  innate  adaptive) contributing to whether or not the animal becomes infected with bTB. Another explanation could be the high likelihood that all animals in such an environment are exposed to the pathogen  and thus the susceptibility to bTB in this environment  as defined in the present study  may better reflect the true estimate of bTB susceptibility. The genetic variance of susceptibility to bTB was also least in the environment with the greatest bTB prevalence  but the heritability of bTB in the very high prevalence environment was greatest. The high pathogen load environment is somewhat analogous to experimental inoculation with bTB and the high heritability for bTB in this environment in the present study (0.25) is closer to the heritability of 0.48 reported for deer experimentally infected with  (0.48; []). It must be noted however  that this heritability estimate of susceptibility to bTB in deer is considered to be high due to the naivety of the deer to TB. Despite this  it could be suggested that the heritability of susceptibility to bTB may actually be greater than the value of 0.11 reported in the present study across all data once the assumption that all animals are equally exposed to the pathogen is fulfilled. A number of factors that contribute to the under-estimation of the heritability of disease susceptibility in livestock have been documented [] using simulated data. Bishop and Woolliams [] identified three factors which contribute to the underestimation of the heritability of disease susceptibility in livestock: Incomplete exposure of animals to the pathogen  resulting in some animals not having the opportunity to express their genotype for the disease. The degree of underestimation is linear with the decreased probability of complete exposure. The strict inclusion criteria for herd-episodes imposed in the present study aimed at maximising the probability of complete exposure. However  complete exposure may not have been reached in some cases. With the observed prevalence of bTB of 0.11 in the entire dataset (Table )  according to Bishop and Woolliams [] equations  an exposure probability of 50% would have been needed in the present study to estimate a sufficiently accurate heritability of susceptibility to bTB. Incomplete sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests used to classify animals as healthy or diseased. Bermingham et al. [] illustrated that the effects of imperfect SICTT sensitivity resulted in an underestimation of the heritability of susceptibility to bTB in Irish and UK dairy cows. Furthermore  Bishop and Woolliams [] concluded that imperfect sensitivity to SICTT has a large effect on the estimate of heritability of susceptibility to bTB  especially when the disease prevalence is as low as 0.10  similar to that observed in the present study. It is also well-documented that the standard SICTT can detect only between 40 and 80% of infected animals [] []. In the present study  to account for the sensitivity of SICTT  only the herd-episodes for which 20% of `reactors’ presented bTB lesions were included  which implies that bTB infection was reasonably established in these herd-episodes. Misclassification of animals due to the dynamic expression of the disease over the course of an infection. With bTB infection  many animals will not present the infection for some time [] and may therefore not be identified when testing is undertaken. Furthermore  during the period of bTB infection  animals within a herd will be at different stages of infection. Animals at the earlier stages of infection will be difficult to detect (since sensitivity to testing is low)  while animals at later stages will be easier to detect. This misclassification will cause underestimation of the heritability  analogous to the effect of imperfect test sensitivity. To reduce the probability of misclassification because of dynamic expression  a number of standard testing procedures for bTB are carried out by the Irish Department of Agriculture  Food and Marine  including annual testing of all animals in herds and continuous surveillance of animals at slaughter. Re-testing of herds after the identification of a `standard reactor’ or an `inconclusive reactor’  at two-month intervals also aims at reducing the likelihood of misclassifying animals due to this effect. For a trait to be included in a breeding goal it must have some relevance (e.g.  economical or social)  be measurable or correlated with a measureable phenotype  and exhibit genetic variation. Bovine tuberculosis is of economic importance [] []  which justifies its consideration for inclusion in the breeding goal. The annual testing of whole herds for bTB and the storage of these data in a national database  as well as access to pedigree information  animal movements and other systematic environmental effects pertaining to the test (e.g.  herd  season  age of animal)  imply that routine genetic evaluations are possible for bTB if genetic variation in susceptibility to bTB exists. Results from this study clearly show that exploitable genetic variation in susceptibility to bTB exists. Moreover  the current genetic trend for sires with more than 50 progeny with bTB data in the national population suggests that susceptibility to bTB infection in the progeny of these animals may be increasing. All these points constitute a strong argument to consider increased resistance to bTB as a trait for selection in Irish dairy and beef breeding and part of the national strategy for bTB eradication in cattle. Moreover  its usefulness in breeding strategies for other cattle populations that are not free of bTB should be investigated. While fears have been expressed that selection for bTB resistance will reduce sensitivity to SICTT testing  it is thought that such a scenario will not arise. Although some estimates of the genetic correlation of susceptibility to bTB between sub-populations were less than 0.8  which means that it cannot be considered as the same trait across these sub-populations  performing separate genetic evaluations for each animal type or for different environments in a multi-trait genetic evaluation may be impractical. Moreover  since all genetic correlation estimates between the different sub-populations were positive  a genetic evaluation using all animal types and environments combined is expected to improve genetic merit across all sub-populations.

A 1% increase in inbreeding based either on pedigree or genomic data was associated with a decrease in milk  fat and protein yields of around 0.4 to 0.6% of the phenotypic mean  and an increase in calving interval (i.e. a deterioration in fertility) of 0.02 to 0.05% of the phenotypic mean. A genome-wide association study using ROH of more than 50 SNPs revealed genomic regions that resulted in depression of up to 12.5 d and 260 L for calving interval and milk yield  respectively  when completely homozygous. Genomic measures can be used instead of pedigree-based inbreeding to estimate inbreeding depression. Both the diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix and the proportion of homozygous SNPs can be used to measure inbreeding. Longer ROH (>3 Mb) were found to be associated with a reduction in milk yield and captured recent inbreeding independently and in addition to overall homozygosity. Inbreeding depression can be reduced by minimizing overall inbreeding but maybe also by avoiding the production of offspring that are homozygous for deleterious alleles at specific genomic regions that are associated with inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness of offspring that result from the mating between individuals that share at least one common ancestor. Inbreeding reduces fitness by increasing the number of homozygous deleterious recessive alleles that affect traits related to fitness  such as survival  disease resistance  predation and birth weight in avian and mammalian populations []. Some published examples include a dramatic effect on offspring survival and reproduction in both mice [] and freshwater snails []. In livestock and poultry species  preventing inbreeding is important because it is associated with a reduction in animal performance and consequently profitability []-[] and with an increased frequency of genetic defects []. Ideally  livestock breeding programs increase the frequency of favourable alleles and possibly their fixation  while minimizing homozygosity for deleterious recessive alleles. With the availability of genotyping data based on high-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chips  these objectives become possible. Genetic markers can be used to estimate inbreeding as the realised proportion of the genome that is identical by descent (IBD)  for example by calculating a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) among individuals []-[]. The expected value of a diagonal element of the GRM  conditional on the pedigree of the animal  is 1 + F where F is the inbreeding coefficient of the animal. Unlike pedigree-based inbreeding  a genomic estimate of inbreeding does not suffer from lack of depth of pedigree data and pedigree errors and it measures realised inbreeding that can vary between animals that have the same pedigree  i.e. full sibs. The diagonal elements of the GRM and the proportion of the genome where SNPs are homozygous are both examples of genomic measures that can be used to estimate the level of inbreeding across the genome. A limitation of both of these measures is that they do not distinguish between identity by state and identity by descent. One possibility to resolve this is to use runs of homozygosity (ROH)  which are regions of the genome where the copies inherited from the two parents are IBD []. ROH can be used to investigate genome-wide inbreeding and to identify the localization of specific regions of the genome that are IBD. Compared to the diagonal or the GRM or proportion of homozygous SNPs  long ROH are unlikely to have arisen by chance  and are more likely to be stretches of homologous chromosomes within the same individual that are IBD []. In fact  the length of ROH inversely correlates to the distance in the pedigree where a common ancestor is present []  which makes it a powerful method to detect inbreeding effects []. ROH are shorter when the common ancestor that gave rise to the inbreeding arose many generations back (distant inbreeding)  while they are longer when inbreeding occurred more recently []. Inbreeding arising from a distant common ancestor should have less effect on fitness compared with inbreeding from a recent common relative because natural selection over long periods of time should act to purge deleterious alleles from the population []. For example  in mice  the effect of inbreeding depression on litter size has been observed to be greater for inbreeding from recent compared with more distant common ancestors []. Dairy cattle are potentially a good model to investigate the effects of genome-wide and genome location-specific inbreeding depression  since phenotypes of traits associated with fitness (e.g.  fertility) and quantitative performance traits (such as milk yield) are measured on a large scale. In addition  intense selection of males to be the sires of the next generation has made it almost impossible to find dairy cattle without multiple common ancestors []  so there is substantial variation in the level of inbreeding among individuals in dairy populations. In this study  we used data on Holstein and Jersey dairy cows with pedigree data and phenotypes for milk production and fertility traits and for which a subset had SNP genotypes to: Estimate inbreeding depression for milk production and fitness traits using pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients. Compare these estimates to inbreeding depression estimated from genome-wide estimates that were derived from SNP data. Investigate whether there are specific regions of the genome that are associated with inbreeding depression in fertility and milk production. Pedigree data that traced back to the 1950s were available on 2 070 219 Holstein and 293 588 Jersey cows []. Animals with unknown parents were assigned to genetic groups based on their birth year  country of origin and sex  following standard Australian Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme (ADHIS; Melbourne  Australia) genetic evaluation procedures []. Only cows with at least two generations of complete pedigree and born after 1994 were retained. The proportion of cows with complete pedigree over the first four generations was approximately 0.75 in both the Holstein and Jersey populations and was derived using the following equation [] []: where  is the pedigree completeness   is the number of generations and  is the proportion of known ancestors in generation . Selection of cows was restricted to animals born in or after 1994 to be able to compare the dataset with only pedigree information with the genotyped population. After editing  pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients were calculated using the algorithm of Meuwissen and Luo [] for 338 696 Holstein and 64 049 Jersey individuals. The genotyped cows that were included in this study were part of an initiative of the Dairy Future’s Cooperative Research Centre (Melbourne  Australia). Briefly  cows were selected to become part of the Australian genomic reference population on the basis of completeness of their phenotypic data. They were also selected to have sires that were genotyped and part of the national Australian genomic reference population. For each cow in the dataset  the validity of its sire was verified by checking for excessive “opposing homozygotes”  which is when an individual’s alleles at a given locus are homozygous  but for different alleles than its sire []. The pedigree was corrected in cases for which a parent could be identified []. Offspring that had more than 20 genotypes that were incompatible with those of their parents were removed. After quality control  genotypes were available for 8853 Holstein and 4138 Jersey females  which were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA; []) using a previously described quality control method for SNP editing []. After editing  45 753 and 43 737 SNPs remained for the Holstein and Jersey datasets  respectively. The SNPs were ordered by chromosome position using  build UMD 3.1 (Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology  University of Maryland  MD). The average spacing between SNPs retained for this study was 58 kb. Homozygous SNPs were coded as 2 or 0 and heterozygous SNPs as 1. The following measures of inbreeding were calculated using the genomic data: The genomic relationship of an individual with itself relative to a base population was calculated as the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix minus 1 (GRM_F) using [] []: where  is the number of SNPs   is the allele frequency of SNP   and s the genotype code at SNP  (0  1 or 2). Allele frequencies  were calculated separately for the Jersey and Holstein populations  which included genotyped males of the same breed  which amounted to a total of 12 649 and 5240 Holstein and Jersey individuals  respectively. Thus  GRM_F was relative to the current population  as represented by the sample of genotyped females and bulls that are part of the Australian genomic reference population. The proportion of the genome that was homozygous (i.e. the proportion of total SNP genotypes that were either AA or BB). The proportion of the genome that consists of runs of homozygosity (ROH_F) that were at least  SNPs in length  where  ranged from 5 to 100. If the ROH at SNP position  exceeded   then   was coded as 1 or else 0. ROH_F was the sum of   divided by the total number of SNPs ():  For the Holstein breed  887 561 lactation records for milk  fat and protein yields were available for 338 696 cows (i.e. each cow had on average 2.6 lactation records) and 755 618 calving interval records (a measure of fertility that records the interval between two consecutive calving dates in days) were available for 299 590 cows. In Australia  calving interval is available on more cows than measures of fertility calculated from insemination and pregnancy diagnosis data []  which is why calving interval was chosen as the fertility trait for analysis. For the Jersey breed  179 108 milk  fat and protein yield records (on average 2.8 lactation records per cow) were available for 64 049 animals and 153 347 calving interval records were available for 57 049 animals. Phenotypic means of the traits included in the analysis are in Table . The average number of lactation records for cows with genotypes was 3.84 and 3.35 for the Holstein and Jersey data  respectively. All analyses were conducted separately for the Holstein and Jersey datasets. Following previous research using a very similar dataset by Haile-Mariam et al. []  we used the following model to estimate the effect of inbreeding on the phenotype being analysed: where  is the  record of the phenotype (milk  fat or protein yield or calving interval)   the  herd-year-season of calving   the  parity   the  month of calving  and b the regression coefficient on age   which was the age at first calving  b is the regression coefficient on   which was the measure of inbreeding (pedigree  GRM_F  homozygosity  or ROH_F)   is the  random permanent environmental effect to account for multiple records on each individual  and  was the random genetic effect for the  animal  assumed to follow the distribution N(0  s)  where  is the numerator relationship matrix  and  is the random error associated with the observation. The quadratic effects of inbreeding were also tested in preliminary analyses but are not presented since none were significant. ASReml version 3.0 was used for the analysis []. Finally  the genomic measures of inbreeding were tested after correcting for pedigree inbreeding by simultaneously fitting pedigree inbreeding and each genomic measure of inbreeding in turn. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) was designed to investigate the effect of overlapping ROH at consecutive positions across the genome using sliding windows  so the number of analyses was equal to the number of SNPs. Since the effect of inbreeding estimated using ROH  was of interest in this analysis  the model also included the SNP present at the start of the ROH to correct for its additive effect. In this analysis  milk yield was used to represent milk production traits  and calving interval to represent fertility traits. The model used for the GWAS was: This model was similar to that defined above  except that  was replaced by two new covariates: (1) the regression coefficient (b) on   which was to correct for the additive effect of the presence of additional copies of the allele  and (2) the regression coefficient (b) on   where  at each SNP position   was coded as 1 when a run of homozygosity of at least 50 SNPs was present at  for that animal  and as 0 otherwise. A ROH was selected as having a statistically significant association with the trait analyzed if the regression coefficient had a p-value less than 0.001. To identify possible candidate genes  QTL regions were defined based on SNP positions with significant associations (P <0.001) of ROH with milk yield or fertility. A list of annotated genes between the positions of the first and last SNP in the ROH or cluster of ROH was obtained from Ensembl BioMart MartView (). QTL regions were also compared to QTL previously identified for the analysed trait through the Cattle QTLdb [] (). For the Holstein breed  the mean inbreeding coefficients  calculated using pedigree  were greater for genotyped cows than for the population that had only pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients. However for the Jersey breed  the opposite was true: inbreeding coefficients of genotyped cows were smaller than those of the pedigree recorded population (Table ; Figure ). Genomic measures of inbreeding were all higher for the Jersey than for the Holstein population (Table ). For example  the average proportion of the genome that was homozygous was 0.66 and 0.72 for the Holstein and Jersey populations  respectively. Jersey animals also had longer ROH than Holstein animals (Figure ). The rate of inbreeding  calculated as the regression of pedigree inbreeding on birth year (1997 to 2007)  was 0.13%/year in Holstein cows with pedigree information and 0.18%/year in the genotyped Holstein population. The equivalent rates for the Jersey animals were both 0.13% (Figure ).  Inbreeding coefficients for all animals in the dataset are shown with a solid line; the genotyped subset are shown with a dashed line.                                                      Correlations of pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients with each measure of genomic inbreeding (i.e.  GRM_F  proportion homozygous  ROH_F) were lower than correlations among the genomic measures of inbreeding (Table ). The correlation of the proportion of the genome that was homozygous with inbreeding coefficient GRM_F was equal to 0.72 for Holstein and 0.66 for Jersey animals. The correlation of ROH_F with the pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient was largest when the number of SNPs in the ROH_F was equal to 10 (Figure a) for both breeds. However  for the Holstein population  the correlation between GRM_F and ROH_F was greater for ROH equal to 1 (0.66)  i.e.  the proportion of SNPs that are homozygous  than for ROH equal to 10 (0.54) (Figure b). For the Jersey population  the correlations between ROH_F and GRM_F were more consistent and ranged from 0.66 for ROH equal to 1 to 0.62 for ROH equal to 10 (Figure b).  Runs of homozygosity refers to the proportion of an individual’s genome that exceeds the number of consecutive SNPs on the horizontal axis.  Correlations between runs of homozygosity and pedigree inbreeding.  Correlations between runs of homozygosity and genomic inbreeding  where genomic inbreeding is the diagonal of the genomic relationship matrix. For Holstein cows  a 1% increase in pedigree-based inbreeding or in GRM_F was associated with a reduction in milk yield of 21 and 28 L/lactation  respectively (Table )  which represents 0.3% to 0.4% of the phenotypic mean  respectively. For Jersey cows  a 1% increase in pedigree-based inbreeding or in GRM_F was associated with a reduction in milk yield of 12 and 27 L/lactation  respectively (Table )  which represents 0.2% and 0.5% of the phenotypic mean  respectively. The effect of inbreeding on fertility was only significant (P <0.05) for the Holstein breed and when using pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients  where a 1% increase in inbreeding was associated with an extension of calving interval of +0.18 d  which represents 0.04% of the phenotypic mean (Table ). Compared to the estimates of inbreeding depression based on the population that had only pedigree information  inbreeding depression effects were generally lower in the genotyped population. Furthermore  in the genotyped population  the effect of inbreeding depression was 2 to 3 times greater based on GRM_F compared to pedigree-based inbreeding for both breeds. For most other traits  the effects of increasing GRM_F were similar for the Holstein and Jersey populations (Table ). However  as a percentage of the phenotypic mean  the average effects of GRM_F on milk  fat and protein yields were greater for the Jersey breed (0.57%) than for the Holstein breed (0.41%). A 1% increase in homozygous SNPs resulted on average in a 1% and 1.5% reduction in milk  fat and protein yields for Holstein and Jersey cows  respectively (Table ). The association with fertility was significant for the Holstein breed (P <0.05) and was equal to 0.93 d per 1% increase in homozygous SNPs (Table ). Increasing GRM_F by 1% increases homozygosity by on average 0.33%  so the effect of a 1% increase in homozygosity is expected to be about 3 times the effect of a 1% increase in GRM_F  which is approximately what we observed. Longer ROH  which indicates a more recent common ancestor  had a stronger unfavourable effect on milk yield than shorter ROH; a ROH of five SNPs led to a much smaller reduction in milk yield than a ROH of 100 SNPs (Figure a). However  general homozygosity may explain part of this relationship. To test this  the model was extended to include the overall level of homozygosity as an additional covariate. At the same level of overall homozygosity  shorter ROH (<60 SNPs) had no statistically significant association with milk yield in both breeds. However  longer ROH were associated with a reduction in milk yield that was independent of the proportion of the genome that was homozygous in the Holstein breed (Figure b).                                                      The association between ROH_F (the proportion of the genome that consists of ROH) and fertility was not significant for either breed (results not shown). In fact  for the Holstein breed  the effect of ROH_F on fertility was almost entirely captured by the overall homozygosity. After correcting for the additive effect of SNPs  some regions of the genome contained stretches of ROH of 50 or more SNPs that were significantly associated with both milk yield and fertility for the Holstein and Jersey breeds. Significant ROH frequently formed clusters at overlapping positions on the genome  which may indicate that they were in linkage disequilibrium with the same QTL. Negative associations of ROH with milk yield were found on chromosomes 11  14  16  17  20  26  28 for the Holstein breed and on chromosomes 8  17  20 and 24 for the Jersey breed (Table ). Unfavourable associations of ROH with calving interval were found on chromosomes 2  5  8  9  15 and 24 for the Holstein breed and on chromosomes 24 and X for the Jersey breed. For calving interval in Holstein cows  seven clusters of ROH were identified on different chromosomes. These clusters comprised a total of 63 ROH that were significant  of which 52 had an unfavourable effect. The false discovery rate (FDR) of the 63 ROH was estimated at 72.5% using the method of Bolormaa et al. []. The most probable real associations are likely to be the largest clusters; for example  there was a region on chromosome 9 in which 26 ROH had an unfavourable association with fertility in the Holstein population (Table ). The size of this region was nearly 3 Mb (i.e. between 6.4 and 9.2 Mb) and included all the ROH (of 50 SNPs or more) present and led to an average increase in calving interval of 7.6 d (ranging from 6.7 to 8.4 d) in the Holstein population. For milk yield in the Holstein population  117 ROH were significant (P <0.001)  which corresponds to a FDR of 39%. Of these 117 ROH  65 had an unfavourable association with milk yield and formed eight clusters. A group of 22 significant ROH (at P <0.001) was found on chromosome 16  which spanned a region between 64.9 and 66.2 Mb that contained 18 candidate genes (Table ). On average  these ROH were associated with a reduction in milk yield of ~228 L/lactation. A region on chromosome 2 between 12.8 and 14.3 Mb that contained 24 ROH showed a significant (P <0.01) and positive (i.e. favourable) association with milk yield and an unfavourable association with calving interval. Although a more stringent significance level was necessary to detect this relationship  it is possible that there are many other regions of the genome with such opposing effects  since correlations between fertility and milk yield are generally unfavourable. Since the Jersey population was smaller  there was less power to detect ROH that had an association with either milk yield or fertility. For this breed  only 44 and 17 ROH were significantly associated with milk yield and fertility  respectively  with FDR of 100% or more indicating that all these associations were probably identified by chance. However  14 ROH on chromosome X had an effect on fertility in this breed (Table )  with an FDR of only 6%  which suggests that this region is associated with inbreeding depression. Three regions on chromosomes 8  20 and 24 were associated with milk yield in the Jersey breed  although none of these overlapped with those found for the Holstein breed. Detecting identical ROH with associations in two breeds is useful for validation  since it is unlikely that the same association is found in two breeds by chance. In our data  such cases were rare and only occurred when the significance threshold for the Jersey breed was relaxed to P <0.01  which is justified by its smaller population size. Of particular interest was a region found on chromosome 24 at 60 Mb that had an unfavourable association with fertility in the Holstein dataset (Table )  which was validated in the Jersey dataset at P <0.01. Correlations of 0.26 and 0.29 were found between inbreeding coefficients based on pedigree and GRM_F for the Jersey and Holstein datasets  respectively (Table ). These values are lower than those observed for USA Holstein bulls (which ranged from 0.5 to 0.56; []) and for Australian Holstein bulls (which ranged from 0.67 to 0.87 for bulls with two to eight generations of recorded ancestry; []). There are three possible reasons why the correlations found in our study are lower than those reported in other studies: (1) individuals from sub-populations for which allele frequencies diverge from those of the entire population are estimated to have high inbreeding based on GRM_F; (2) pedigree completeness and (3) a possible bias introduced by the selection of the cows that were genotyped  since cows that had multiple lactation records were preferentially selected  which may have purged strongly deleterious effects out of this older population. In fact  the genotyped populations were on average 1.2 lactations older for the Holstein dataset and 0.6 lactations older for the Jersey dataset. So  purging may explain why pedigree inbreeding depression (Table ) was on average 59% and 12.8% lower in the genotyped Holstein and Jersey populations  respectively  compared with the population that had only pedigree information. This comparison suggests that the effect of purging in the genotyped population could be greater than the value of 12.6% predicted by Gulisija and Crow []. Correlations of the proportion of homozygous SNPs with pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients were stronger than the equivalent correlations using GRM_F for both Holstein and Jersey populations. The lower correlations obtained with GRM_F are probably due to the effect of allele frequencies in the sub-population on the diagonal elements of the GRM  which results in artificially elevated “inbreeding coefficients” in minority sub-populations. To overcome this problem  several authors [] [] [] have proposed calculating the GRM with allele frequencies fixed at 0.5. In fact  the resulting GRM is the same as the proportion of homozygous SNPs  since the correlation between these was equal to 0.99 []. Therefore  using either the proportion of homozygous SNPs or the equivalent measure of the diagonal of the GRM calculated with an allele frequency of 0.5 is preferred for the estimation of a base population. In accordance with other studies  the correlations between pedigree and genomic measures of inbreeding in cows were lower than the equivalent estimates in bulls [] []  which implies that pedigree recording was worse for females than for males. This is expected for commercial dairy populations and is exacerbated in countries like Australia where calving occurs in unsupervised outside conditions and mismothering of calves is a problem. Furthermore  partial or incomplete pedigrees also reduce pedigree inbreeding estimates []. Pedigree completeness was lower for the Jersey dataset than for the Holstein dataset  which probably explains why the correlation between proportion of homozygous SNPs and pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients was weaker for the Jersey than for the Holstein population. This is consistent with the fact that pedigree inbreeding tends to be lower for genotyped Jersey cows than for all Jersey and Holstein animals (Figure ). However  inbreeding for all measures derived from genomic data was higher for the Jersey than the Holstein population. Furthermore  Jersey cows had on average a higher proportion of homozygous SNPs than Holstein cows (0.72 and 0.66  respectively) which is probably because (1) Jerseys were more inbred or (2) many of the SNPs on the genotyping panel were discovered using Holstein animals []. The correlation between ROH and pedigree-based inbreeding was strongest for ROH that consisted of 10 SNPs (0.58 Mb) (Figure a) and stronger than the correlation of any other genomic measure with pedigree-based inbreeding (Table ). In the absence of pedigree data  the proportion of the genome that comprises ROH of 10 SNPs or more can be used to infer recent common ancestors [] []  which makes ROH an attractive tool to monitor and evaluate inbreeding depression. A 1% increase in inbreeding in the population with pedigree information only  or in the population with GRM_F resulted in a reduction in milk production traits of around 0.3% of the phenotypic mean and a deterioration in fertility for both the Holstein (Table ) and the Jersey breeds. Comparable results have previously been published using pedigree-based inbreeding; a 1% increase in inbreeding has been estimated to be associated with a reduction in milk yield of around 20 to 30 L/lactation []-[] [] [] and a lengthening of calving interval of up to 0.7 d [] []. The small effect of inbreeding on calving interval may be due to the tendency of Australian farmers to cull cows that are expected to calve late  causing a downward bias in the effect on calving interval. There have been relatively few studies on inbreeding depression using genomic measures of inbreeding. Recently  Bjelland et al. [] estimated inbreeding depression using a measure similar to GRM_F and found a reduction in milk yield of 47 L/lactation and an increase of 1.06 d for days open (which is a trait very similar to calving interval) per % increase in inbreeding. The results presented in our study and those of Bjelland et al. [] show that genomic estimates of inbreeding can be used instead of pedigree estimates to calculate the effects of inbreeding on performance and fitness traits. Under ideal conditions  the effect of pedigree inbreeding and GRM_F would be the same. However  errors in pedigree records are expected to reduce pedigree-based estimates of inbreeding depression. Estimates based on GRM_F should have a lower sampling error than those based on pedigree because it is not affected by incomplete pedigrees and it uses observed rather than expected IBD. However  this benefit had less effect on standard errors obtained in this study than the large difference in sample size used for the pedigree and genomic analyses. The magnitude of the difference in inbreeding depression estimated based on GRM_F and based on pedigree information for the genotyped cows implies that estimates of inbreeding depression on traits of economic importance may in fact be underestimated using pedigree information. The proportion of homozygous SNPs was associated with inbreeding depression in all traits analysed  with the exception of fertility in the Jersey breed  which could be due to a lack of statistical power and bias in calving interval caused by culling. However  the association between homozygosity and milk production was not stronger than that between GRM_F and milk production (Tables  and ). The allele frequencies of SNPs contain information on the probability that chromosome segments are IBD because segments that share a rare allele are more likely to be IBD than segments that share a common allele. Thus  including the base population in the calculation of inbreeding (i.e. GRM_F) can be advantageous. However  the correlation between pedigree-based inbreeding and SNP homozygosity was higher and as previously discussed  sub-populations that have allele frequencies that differ markedly from those of the base population appear to be more inbred than they actually are. Therefore  GRM_F has both advantages and disadvantages compared to SNP homozygosity as a measure of inbreeding. These advantages and disadvantages appear to approximately compensate each other  so while homozygosity may be a better indicator of pedigree-based inbreeding  it appears that GRM_F and homozygosity are equally good indicators of inbreeding depression. Long ROH (>60 SNP or 3.5 Mb) were associated with a decrease in milk yield after correcting for average homozygosity  but short ROH were not. This could be due to selection eliminating deleterious mutations before inbreeding occurs if the inbreeding is due to an ancient common ancestor. Inbreeding arising from recent common ancestors has also been found to be associated with reproductive performance and body weight in mice [] and with a large decrease in height in humans []. To account for recent and older inbreeding simultaneously in breeding programs that aim at reducing inbreeding  longer ROH (>50 SNPs or 3 Mb) should be explicitly considered in addition to other measures of genomic inbreeding. In this study  the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA; []) was used because of its popularity to estimate genomic breeding values []. However  while this chip may be suitable for genomic evaluations  it has been reported to overestimate the number of ROH present compared to the Illumina HD panel []. However  both SNP panels are equally effective at detecting segments that are longer than 4 Mb  which corresponds to approximately 70 SNPs []. Thus  a negative aspect of our study could be that short ROH are not necessarily IBD. However  relying on longer ROH has the disadvantage that they have a lower frequency (Figure ) and thus fail to identify small IBD regions. An area for future research could be to compare inbreeding effects of ROH obtained with high-density chips  or even whole-genome sequences with those obtained with lower density SNP panels. For the GWAS analysis  a ROH length of at least 50 SNPs (~3 Mb) was chosen because  in this case  the ROH frequency was large enough to detect statistically significant differences and the ROH length was sufficient to detect recent inbreeding. Other studies [] have reported that using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip with ROH length set at 50 SNPs allowed the detection of fragments of more variable size (especially those less than 5 Mb) when compared to ROH of 50 SNPs. After correcting for the additive effect of the SNP at a given position  using a GWAS analysis  we still detected an effect of ROH on either calving interval or milk yield of up to 12.5 d and 260 L  respectively. This implies that there is considerable value in selecting for heterozygosity in regions where homozygosity has an unfavourable effect on valuable traits  such as fertility and milk yield. However  although our analysis identified several regions of interest  the associated FDR were high  which means that further validation is required. The regions that were identified here were not close to the recessive lethal haplotypes reported by VanRaden et al. [] and Fritz et al. []  for which no homozygotes were observed. This is not surprising  since the homozygous regions detected in our study were present in the population and therefore  were unlikely to have a lethal effect. However  the ROH that were identified as significant could be associated with genes that  if impaired  can lead to loss-of-function. In addition  when the presence of a ROH has a positive effect on a trait under selection  such as milk yield or fertility  it can be indicative of selection signatures []. For the Holstein population  a region on chromosome 16 contained 22 ROH that had a negative effect on milk volume. This region included 18 genes (see Additional file ). The most promising candidate gene in this region is  ()  which is involved in alanine  aspartate  and glutamate metabolism  arginine and proline metabolism and nitrogen metabolism. This gene has previously been reported to control fat to protein ratio []. Another region on chromosome 28 that affected milk yield contained eight genes. Bouwman et al [] reported the identification of SNPs associated with milk fatty acid composition in this region. On chromosome 20  two ROH were detected that  when homozygous  had a negative effect on milk yield in both the Holstein and Jersey breeds. Selection signatures close to this region have been identified in the genomes of US and German Holsteins [] [] and the  () gene has been proposed as the likely candidate gene []  although some publications suggest other possible candidates  such as  () [] []. Neither  nor  aligned with the genes identified in our scan. One hypothesis is that intense selection for  or  has made this genomic region globally more homozygous and while homozygosity of specific alleles may be beneficial  overall homozygosity is detrimental to production because of unfavourable alleles that are in linkage disequilibrium with the favourable alleles of /. For the Jersey breed  there was a cluster of 14 ROH on the X chromosome  located between 60.4 and 62.1 Mb (Table )  that were significantly (P <0.001) associated with fertility. A candidate gene in this region (; ) has been reported to be associated with mild defects in reproduction and growth in mice []. Insulin receptor substrates mediate the actions of insulin and control energy balance and glucose homeostasis []. One of the strengths of this study was that two breeds  Holstein and Jersey  were used. Thus  any effects that were detected in one breed and validated in the other are more likely to be true rather than false discoveries. Unfortunately  there was only one region (on chromosome 24 at around 60 Mb)  with an unfavourable association with fertility  that was validated in both breeds. No candidate genes were identified in this region (see Additional file )  although the ROH could have been in linkage disequilibrium with QTL that were located further away. Our understanding of genomic inbreeding will improve as datasets increase in size and the ability to find causative mutations will also increase as a result of high-density genotyping and sequencing. One potential use of non-additive effects is to predict the future performance of a cow or of the potential heifer resulting from a planned mating. This prediction would use both the additive and dominance effects and should reduce the production of calves that are homozygous for deleterious mutations. In the past  customised mating programs have focused on genome-wide inbreeding [] [] but  with the availability of genomic data  information on the genomic locations for which deleterious recessive alleles segregate  could be used. Genomic measures of inbreeding can be used instead of pedigree-based inbreeding to estimate the effects of inbreeding depression and give similar estimates. Milk  fat and protein yields and fertility were unfavourably impacted by increasing genomic and pedigree measures of inbreeding for the Holstein and Jersey breeds of dairy cattle. Although inbreeding was higher for the Jersey than the Holstein breed  the effect of increasing inbreeding on the traits studied was similar for both breeds. In situations where sub-populations are suspected  it may be preferable to consider a measure of inbreeding that does not depend on allele frequencies  such as the proportion of homozygous SNPs. However  in our data  homozygosity did not have a larger effect on milk production and fertility than the diagonal element of the GRM. ROH can provide additional benefits  since longer ROH (>3 Mb) capture recent inbreeding  which had an effect independent of overall homozygosity on milk production. Using a GWAS with ROH of 50 or more SNPs  genomic regions were detected that had an effect of up to 12.5 d and 260 L for calving interval and milk yield  respectively  when completely homozygous. Breeding programs could exploit whole-genome data  as well as these site-specific regions. JP did the analyses and wrote the paper with BJH  MHM and MEG. MHM prepared the phenotype data and calculated pedigree inbreeding coefficients. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. Keller LF  Waller DM: Inbreeding effects in wild populations.

Host-pathogen co-evolution has a major effect on the features of host immune receptors. Our results suggest that avian and mammalian TLR may be differentially adapted to pathogen-derived ligand recognition. We have detected signatures of positive selection even within the Galloanserae lineage. To our knowledge  this is the first study to depict evolutionary pressures on Galloanserae TLR and to estimate the validity of current knowledge on TLR function (based on mammalian and chicken models) for non-model species of this clade. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are part of the pattern recognition receptor machinery and play a key role in initial pathogen recognition in vertebrates []. Since TLR are responsible for the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns that are present on pathogens []  the efficiency of innate immunity in vertebrates is conditioned by their optimal functioning. Substantial variability has been described for TLR  both at the interspecific and intraspecific level []. Variability in the structure and binding features of TLR could significantly influence host resistance to diseases and vulnerability to autoimmune damage. TLR evolution has been intensively studied in vertebrates in general []-[] and within the mammalian clade in particular []-[]. In birds  although the number of studies on the evolution of TLR has steadily increased []-[]  there is still a very limited understanding of the functional significance of the putatively adaptive variability observed. There are ten  genes in birds [] [] []  including those encoding predominantly bacterial-sensing TLR  such as TLR4 and TLR5  and viral-sensing TLR  such as TLR7. Although the TLR and their corresponding genes have been well characterised in the domestic chicken ([]-[])  our knowledge on TLR of other avian species remains rather fragmentary [] []-[]. Based mainly on data for the domestic chicken  we assume that the ligands recognized by avian TLR are similar to their mammalian counterparts []  i.e. TLR4 binds lipopolysaccharide (LPS) []  TLR5 binds flagellin [] and TLR7 binds viral single-stranded RNA and synthetic antivirals [] []. The structure of bacterial ligands  such as LPS or flagellin  varies between species []-[]  which may exert selective pressure on TLR and lead to host-pathogen co-evolution of these molecules []. Previously  it has been shown that TLR-ligand binding is  in many aspects  species-specific and that TLR protein variation may have a functional significance [] [] []-[] that could affect resistance to pathogen infections [] []. The function of the receptor is determined by its tertiary structure and surface features that confer specificity for ligands. TLR are type I integral membrane glycoproteins that are characterized by an extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD) and a cytoplasmic signalling Toll/IL-1R homology (TIR) domain. Three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures of the ECD []-[] and TIR domains [] [] have been described for several human and mouse TLR. In several other cases  the ECD structures are predicted []-[]. Most recently  the TLR5 ECD structure has been resolved in zebrafish ([]). These studies have identified TLR ligand-binding sites. All these protein structures  however  represent mammalian or fish TLR only  no avian TLR have been characterised or even predicted in 3D as yet. In this study  we provide a comprehensive view on the evolution of TLR in Galloanserae birds. Galloanserae is an ancient clade of avian species that includes the orders Galliformes and Anseriformes which are largely separated from all other modern birds of the Neoaves lineage []. Currently  this is the most extensively studied avian taxon regarding TLR immunogenetics. Based on published data  we investigated the sequence and structural variability of TLR4  TLR5 and TLR7 within this bird clade. These three TLR were chosen as representatives of the bacterial-sensing and viral-sensing TLR based on published sequence data. Since comparison of 3D structures and protein surface features may reveal biologically interesting similarities not detectable by sequence analysis []  the 3D tertiary structure of these three proteins was modelled. We then carried out a structural comparison of functionally important regions  a comparison of surface electrostatic potentials and four independent analyses of positive selection. Superposition of the 3D structures allowed us  for the first time  to conduct a phenetic (not only phylogenetic) analysis of avian TLR evolution. Coding DNA sequences (CDS) for the selected TLR were downloaded from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank for all Galloanserae species currently available in full length (n = 13) and for humans and mouse. GenBank ID are given in Additional file : Table S1. CDS translation was performed using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Tom Hall  Ibis Biosciences  Carlsbad  California  USA) and protein sequences for each gene were aligned using ClustalW multiple-sequence alignment software. Alignment of nucleotide codons and their corresponding protein sequences was undertaken using the PAL2NAL webtool []. To predict the distribution of structural domains in the proteins  we applied SMART []. Since the analysis revealed differences between species in the number and position of leucine-rich repeats (LRR) we tested LRR distribution by an independent approach using the LRRfinder  with upper and lower boundaries fixed at 95% and 80%  respectively []. Because the results of these two approaches differed slightly  SMART predictions were only used to identify N-terminal LRR (LRRNT) and C-terminal LRR (LRRCT) motifs which in most cases were not identified by LRRfinder  while other LRR were identified based on LRRfinder predictions. Molecular weight and charge at pH = 7 were also calculated for each predicted protein. Presence of a transmembrane (TM) region in each protein was checked for on the DAS-TMfilter server []. When the TIR domain was not detected by SMART  we used PFAM comparison [] to check for its presence. Signal peptides were identified using SignalP 4.0 []. Finally  secondary and 3D tertiary structures of the three TLR were predicted by applying a comparative modelling approach (see e.g. [] [] or []) using I-TASSER []  which is currently the leading protein structure prediction server (see []) and )). The I-TASSER server uses a hierarchical protein-structure modelling approach based on secondary-structure enhanced profile-profile threading alignment and iterative implementation of the threading assembly refinement program []. For the prediction of secondary structures  we used the whole CDS  whereas ECD and TIR domains were modelled separately in order to compare tertiary structures. Since it has been shown that the sequence for TLR7 up to LRR14 is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum []  we modelled the sequence starting at amino-acid 417 only. Models with the highest C-scores and conformation similarities to other modelled structures were used for further analysis. In these models  we excluded regions with limited structural stability (i.e. regions with high modelling errors: signal peptides and regions following LRRCT). Modelling errors in the regions of interest were estimated using ModFOLD []; all models had high levels of confidence with P-values less than 0.002 and Global model quality scores greater than 0.37. Although the accuracy of our models may still have been limited  the aim of this study was not to describe the proteins’ tertiary structures precisely but to assess average structural similarity between the receptors. The error estimates obtained indicate that the models constructed represent reasonably reliable inputs for further phenetic analysis. Images of the predicted protein 3D structures were visualised using PyMOL software v. 1.5 (). Protein electrostatic potentials were calculated using PDB2PQR v. 1.9.0 [] (PDB2PQR Server  ) based on the PARSE force-field and electrostatic calculation in the APBS web solver [] (). Surface charge distribution was visualised using Jmol v. 12.2 (). Alignments of    and  CDS were used for phylogenetic analysis using a maximum likelihood (ML) method. As outgroups  we used orthologous human and mouse sequences. FindModel () was used to evaluate the fit of 28 nested nucleotide substitution models to the data  the best model for each alignment being selected on the basis of the Akaike information criterion. ML analyses were performed using PHYML []  with the NNI algorithm and BIONJ distance-based tree as the starting tree. Bootstrap analysis (with 1000 replicates) was performed to estimate the robustness of internal nodes. The results were visualised in FigTree v. 1.3.1 (). A consensus phylogenetic tree including all investigated species (see Additional file : Figure S1) was constructed using the avian phylogenetic tool available at []. We used the Hackett backbone [] as the source tree with 1000 randomly generated trees. The maximum clade credibility tree was produced using the TreeAnnotator v. 1.8.0 tool in BEAST v. 1.8.0 software []. Phenetic similarity analysis of the predicted protein secondary and tertiary structures was performed to detect conserved structures in avian TLR. Secondary structures were compared based on alignments obtained using the EMBOSS Needle pairwise alignment tool ()  using chicken () GaGaTLR sequences as references. To predict 3D structures  we used the adjusted I-TASSER pdb models for structural superposition in the DALI pairwise comparison tool []. The pair-wise root mean square deviations (RMSD) metric was used to compare protein structures [] [] and to construct distance matrices that subsequently served as matrices of Euclidean distances in cluster analysis using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method in STATISTICA v. 6.0 (StatSoft  Inc.  Tulsa  OK  USA; []; for a similar approach see []). Before testing for selection  all codons containing gaps in any species in the alignment were removed (this applied to only six codons in TLR5; throughout the text  codon positions are numbered according to the chicken GaGaTLR5 sequence (see Additional file : Table S1). We used two methods to test for positive selection on individual residues at the interspecific level within the Galloanserae clade  i.e. (1) the hierarchical Bayes (Bayes Empirical Bayes  BEB) approach with implemented Markov chain Monte Carlo routine - PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood []); and (2) FUBAR (A Fast  Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for inferring selection []). For PAML (v. 4.6)  we used codon-based substitution models (codeml) to identify amino acid sites under positive selection in the CDS comparing the neutral M8a (beta&<U+03C9> = 1) model with the alternative M8 (beta&<U+03C9>) model. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) for the comparison of two nested models was calculated using chi-square approximation: Chi = 2 × (lnLM8 - lnLM8a)  where LM8 and LM8a are likelihood values. The degrees of freedom (df) were defined as the difference in the number of parameters in the models used (see Additional file : Table S6). If the LRT was less than 0.05  positive selection was considered significant. The BEB approach [] was used to determine site-specific posterior probabilities of positive selection (=0.9). FUBAR analysis was performed on the Datamonkey server (  []) using a default significance level of posterior probability set at 0.9. In this study  we applied the FUBAR algorithm because it is more robust and much faster than selection analysis based on random effect likelihood (REL methods []). We tested the degree of dissimilarity of amino acid substitutions according to their physiochemical properties using the new PRIME (PRoperty Informed Model of Evolution) tool available on the Datamonkey server []. We used the set of five composite physiochemical properties proposed by Atchley et al. []  i.e. polarity index  secondary structure factor  volume  refractivity/heat capacity and charge/iso-electric point. A change in these properties was considered significant if the posterior probability was greater than 0.9. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid positions was predicted using the ConSurf tool []  with the assumption that positively selected residues (functionally important for pathogen binding) were the least conserved. For all ConSurf analyses  we used GaGaTLR protein 3D models (obtained as described above) and the LG substitution matrix []. A phylogenetic tree of the three  genes studied including all investigated species in the PAML and ConSurf analyses was constructed as described above (see Additional file : Figure S1). We were able to verify the homology of all sequences examined (see Additional file : Figure S2) and subsequently to assess amino acid identity and similarity (see Additional file : Table S2). The phylogeny of the  genes was consistent with known phylogeny for the Galloanserae clade [] (see Additional file : Figures S1 and S2). While the size of both TLR4 and TLR7 was uniform (843 aa and 1047 aa  respectively)  TLR5 varied in length between 859 aa and 862 aa (see Additional file : Table S3 and Additional file : Section S1). The orthologues showed little variation in molecular weights  although some differed markedly in their charge at pH = 7 (see Additional file : Table S3). Since localised charge variability can influence protein conformation and domain composition and produce variation in ligand-binding features  we examined charge and structural variation in more detail. TLR proteins are likely to be involved in host-parasite co-evolution  and thus shaped by parasite-mediated natural selection []. Interspecific differences in TLR protein structure  therefore  may exhibit imprints of structural evolutionary convergence due to selection. In this study  for the first time in birds  we were able to model secondary and tertiary structures of TLR4  TLR5 and TLR7 for all Galloanserae species with currently known CDS. Secondary structures for the proteins predicted by I-TASSER revealed low levels of interspecific structural variability within individual TLR (see Additional file : Figure S3). Although two regions of potential functional interest in TLR4 were polymorphic (see Additional file : Section S2)  the most important structural motifs in all three receptors were conserved in all species analysed  resulting in more than 90% interspecific identity in secondary structure distribution (see Additional file : Table S4). As a result  3D extracellular domain models invariably had a horseshoe-like shape  in which the concave surface comprised ß-sheets and the convex surface parallel loops and short helices. The TIR domain (which was modelled separately) had a globular shape. A phenetic analysis of RMSD distances obtained by superposition of the modelled structures revealed that structural variability in the TIR domain of all three receptors was lower than ECD variability (see Additional file : Figures S4d  S4e and S4f). This may be a result of higher conservation in the TIR domain when compared to ECD []  although domain size may also have played a role as RMSD tends to increase with protein size. Avian TLR4 ECD showed a stronger structural resemblance to human TLR4 than mouse TLR4 (see Additional file : Figure S4a)  which suggests that avian TLR4 may exhibit similar binding features to human TLR4. At present  however  this must remain a hypothesis since current experimental data provide no support []. As the RMSD of our superposed models were below 2.5 Å (i.e. deviation between models was lower than the accuracy of individual models)  we conclude that TLR4 and TLR5 ECD structural variability within the Galloanserae is generally low and probably unimportant (see Additional file : Figures S4a and S4b). Of more interest is the ECD of TLR7  with the phenogram indicating that Anseriform TLR7 exhibits a close structural relationship to human TLR7  while Galliform TLR7 clusters with murine TLR7 (see Additional file : Figure S4c). Despite this  the RMSD were too low to indicate any meaningful structural variation. The low TLR structural variability observed in this study is consistent with recent findings for rodents []. After showing that the protein tertiary structures were highly conserved  we ascertained interspecific differences in surface features by modelling electrostatic potential distribution on the TLR protein surfaces. While TIR domain surface charge distribution remained relatively conserved  we observed high variability in TLR ECD (see Additional file : Figure S5). Anseriform TLR ECD differed from ECD of their Galliform counterparts. Species-specific differences were observed even between individual species within the Galliformes. Avian TLR4 ECD surface-charge distribution was clearly distinguishable from that of mammalian (murine and human) TLR4  although surface charge for the predicted avian ligand-binding region [] []  in particular  was clearly closer to that of murine TLR4 than human TLR4 (Figure a). This is consistent with a previous observation indicating that GaGaTLR4 LPS-binding specificity shows greater similarity to that of murine TLR4 than human TLR4 []. Variability was much lower in TLR5 ECD; although  once again  avian TLR5 charge distribution at the flagellin-binding site predicted for mammals [] was closer to that for murine TLR5 than human TLR5 (Figure b). As for TLR4  these results are in concordance with the results of previous functional assays []. In contrast  for both TLR7 (Figure c) and the flagellin-binding interface-A region identified in zebrafish []  electrostatic potential distribution at the predicted ligand-binding interface [] resembled that of human TLR more than murine TLR.  TLR4   TLR5   TLR7; positive surface charge is highlighted in red  negative charge in blue; the predicted functional sites in ECD are outlined in yellow in the GaGaTLR models; GaGa = chicken   AnAn = goose   AnPl = duck   HoSa = human   MuMu = mouse . To further explore potential interspecific variability in the ligand-binding properties of avian TLR proteins  we compared basic chemical features of residues known or predicted to be functionally important in other vertebrate TLR [] [] [] [] [] []. These included residues directly involved in ligand binding  TLR homodimerization and MD-2 heterodimerization. At most of the predicted functional sites in avian TLR  similar chemical properties were preserved as in mammalian TLR (see Additional file : Table S5). Such conservation was particularly visible in TLR7  which suggests that most receptor-ligand interactions in TLR7 are highly conserved (see Additional file : Section S3). In TLR5  we identified substantial residue differences at the binding region previously described in zebrafish [] as separating fish from amniotes (see Additional file : Table S5). Primary binding interfaces A and B  as well as both dimerization interfaces  appear to be only modestly conserved  indicating that flagellin binding probably differs in fish and amniotes. This is further supported by the fact that avian TLR5 sites generally retain their physiochemical properties at those binding residues predicted for mammals. Intriguingly  we identified potentially important changes in amino acid properties at several TLR4 functional sites  which suggests variability in LPS binding and MD-2 dimerization (see Additional file : Table S5). In a number of cases  residue changes precluded the existence of charge (positions 268 and 397) or hydrophobic interactions (positions 449 and 472) known for human TLR4 [] []. Interestingly  all avian species possess arginine at position 393; in this respect  avian TLR4 is identical to equine TLR4 [] but distinct from human TLR4. This suggests that lipid IVa in birds serves as an agonist triggering a TLR4-MD-2-mediated immune response  just as it does in horses []. Galliformes also display systematic differences from Anseriformes at several positions (see Additional file : Section S3). Thus  our results suggest that the ligand-binding features of avian TLR differ not only from mammalian TLR but also between the various avian taxa. This is in concordance with previously reported experimental results [] []. Chicken  genes show remarkable differences in the level of sequence polymorphism  most likely as a result of distinct positive and negative selection [] [] []. This is further supported by analysis of partial  CDS in previous studies on avian species [] []. In this study  we investigated signatures for positive  diversifying selection acting on individual positions in TLR4  TLR5 and TLR7 within the Galloanserae lineage. We identified one positively selected site in TLR4  11 sites in TLR5 and eight sites in TLR7  using three different methods (Figures    and ). Two of the approaches used were based on site-by-site synonymous and non-synonymous rate ratios (PAML and FUBAR)  which detected seven positively selected sites in both TLR5 and TLR7 but no positively selected sites in TLR4 (see Additional file : Table S7). The lack of evidence for positive selection in TLR4 is probably due to the low power of analysis because of a limited number of distantly-related species (all species of the genus  are genetically closely-related  and thus display similar genetic sequences); hence  in this case  the lack of evidence should be treated as a probable methodological artefact. The third method which used a physiochemical comparative approach (PRIME)  detected positive selection in all three proteins  with one positively selected site in TLR4  five sites in TLR5 and two sites in TLR7 (see Additional file : Table S8). Of the 20 positively selected sites detected in total  only one was located in the transmembrane domain  the others being located in ECD. No positive selection signatures were detected in the intracellular TIR domain  which suggests that positive selection acts mainly on ligand-binding regions. This confirms the results of similar analyses undertaken on mammals [] [] [] [] [] and amniotes []. Projection of positively selected and functionally important sites onto 3D protein models of GaGaTLR revealed changes at six positions (TLR4: 343; TLR5: 180  209  342  379; TLR7: 26) that could directly influence receptor expression or function (Figures    and   see Additional file : Tables S7 and S8 and Additional file : Section S4). As in other birds [] []  Galloanserae TLR5 displayed a relatively high accumulation of codons that exhibit positive selection. This is in concordance with the results of Wlasiuk et al. [] reported for primates. On the other hand  TLR7 has previously been shown to evolve mainly under purifying selection in birds; with no or only limited positively selected sites in the predicted ligand-binding region [] [] [] []. In this study  we were able to detect some positively selected sites (Figure ; see Additional file : Tables S7 and S8); however  given their locations (except for position 26)  these sites appear to have only limited functional importance and their impact remains unclear.  Positively selected sites are highlighted in red  evolutionarily non-conservative sites in blue and functionally important sites known from mammalian studies [] []-[] [] in black (only positions lying in close proximity to the selected or non-conservative sites are numbered); GaGaTLR residue numbering has been adopted; selected sites or non-conservative residues located in close proximity to any of the predicted functional sites are indicated by a filled red or blue rectangle  respectively; arrows indicate positively selected sites concurrent with those identified in previous studies (filled green = avian  filled blue = mammalian  filled green with a blue border = avian and mammalian  open blue = site in neighbourhood); position 268 has been identified in mice and humans as a site directly responsible for MD-2 dimerization and LPS binding.  Positively selected sites are highlighted in red  evolutionarily non-conservative sites in blue and functionally important sites known from fish []  and predicted for mammals []  are in black (only positions lying in close proximity to the selected or non-conservative sites are numbered); GaGaTLR residue numbering has been adopted; selected sites or non-conservative residues located in close proximity to any of the predicted functional sites are indicated by a filled red or blue rectangle  respectively; overlap of the identified selected positions with non-conservative residues is indicated by a red number in an open blue rectangle; arrows indicate positively selected sites concurrent with those identified in previous studies (filled green = avian  filled blue = mammalian  filled green with blue border = avian and mammalian  open blue = site in neighbourhood); position 209 has been identified as both positively selected and non-conservative; in addition  this residuum (209) is also known as a flagellin-binding site in fish  as are residues 183 and 379; position 342 is both positively-selected and non-conservative and lies in close proximity to residuum 344 which has been recognised as a possible flagellin-binding site in mammals.  Positively selected sites are highlighted in red  evolutionarily non-conservative sites in blue and functionally important sites predicted for mammals [] are in black; GaGaTLR residue numbering has been adopted; overlap of the identified selected positions with non-conservative residues is indicated by a red number in an open blue rectangle; arrows indicate positively selected sites concurrent with those identified in previous studies (filled blue = mammalian  open blue = site in neighbourhood). While the vast majority of residues in TLR were evolutionarily highly conservative  consistent with purifying selection on TLR [] [] []  ConSurf analysis revealed 26 reliable evolutionarily non-conservative sites in TLR4  28 in TLR5 and 25 in TLR7 (Figures    and  and (see Additional file : Table S9 for detailed information). These may also represent positively selected sites since functionally important positively-selected residues are also predicted to be the least conserved. This is supported by the location of six of the non-conservative sites in the functionally important TLR4 signal peptide  four in the predicted TLR4-MD-2-binding regions [] []  three in the LPS-binding regions [] []  two in the TLR4-TLR4-dimerization regions [] and one in the trans-membrane region (see Additional file : Section S4). One of the non-conservative positions identified in our Galloanserae dataset (383) has previously been identified as a possible single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) responsible for  resistance in the domestic chicken []. In TLR5  one non-conservative site was situated in the signal peptide  five in the flagellin-binding residues identified in fish []  two in flagellin-binding residues predicted in mammals [] and two in the trans-membrane region. Most of the non-conservative sites in TLR7 were situated in the excised region [] (and hence likely to be functionally unimportant)  with just one in the potentially relevant signal peptide and one in the TIR domain. Intriguingly  both the positively-selected and non-conservative sites identified in this study partly match the positively selected sites detected in previous studies in other vertebrate taxa [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] (Figures    and   Additional file : Table S10 and Additional file : Section S4). In TLR4 and TLR5  15 and 20 candidate sites  respectively  were either precisely the same or lay in close proximity (up to 2 aa) to a site identified in previous studies. In contrast  only seven sites were close to  or the same as  previously detected sites in TLR7. Most importantly  there was consensus for positive selection on site 270 in the predicted MD-2-binding region in TLR4 in birds  and on sites 183  209  264 and 342 in TLR5 both in birds and mammals  all of which are predicted flagellin binding sites or sites in close proximity to these binding sites (see Additional file : Section S4). No consensus site was located in the predicted ligand-binding region in TLR7. Independent concordance between the results of selection analysis in several studies that cover different taxa  and topological agreement between the identified sites and predicted functionally important regions  strongly support the proposed importance of diversifying selection or positive selection in the evolution of these residues. In human TLR4  for example  it has been demonstrated that even SNP located far from MD-2-dimerization or LPS-binding sites can modify responsiveness to LPS [] or influence the binding of other ligands. Thus  other consensus selected sites identified in TLR4 (205  246  273–275  301 and 406  Figure ) and TLR5 (281  293  314  422  508  525 and 532  Figure ) may play an important role in the evolution of TLR-ligand binding in birds (see Additional file : Table S10). However  the potentially important consensus sites identified in TLR7  are located mainly in the excised region [] (residues at positions 39  99 and 383) and do not appear to influence receptor function. The only exception to this is site 665 which lies  however  outside the predicted ligand-binding region. Given the generally low concordance in predicted positively-selected sites between studies  we suggest that many of the sites reported for TLR7 represent false-positive predictions resulting from the method applied (most sites were identified by REL or FEL; see [] for discussion). In concordance with previous studies  we found stronger signatures of positive selection acting on the ligand-binding regions in TLR4 [] and TLR5 [] than in TLR7 []. There are several possible explanations for this. First  bacterial-sensing TLR such as TLR4 and TLR5 recognise structurally variable ligands []-[]  while viral-sensing TLR7 detects structurally invariant RNA molecules regardless of their precise sequence []. Hence  TLR7 is likely to have evolved mainly under purifying selection  while TLR4 and TLR5 evolved mainly under diversifying selection. Furthermore  since TLR4 is capable of recognising several unrelated ligands []  it is also possible that this receptor evolved more rapidly. Second  there appears to be greater redundancy in bacterial recognition than viral recognition. In TLR5  for example  several studies have proposed relaxed purifying selection [] []  while nonsense stop-codons have been described in both birds [] and mammals []. This may be a result of the presence of other flagellin receptors which may compensate for malfunction of TLR5 (discussed in []). Finally  the limited number of positively selected sites detected in the TLR7 ligand-binding region may result from the limited knowledge about its precise location. While the precise mechanism of ligand-binding has been described for both TLR4 []-[] and TLR5 []  only crude predictions are available for TLR7 []. Although all these explanations may be relevant to some extent  the relatively low concordance between results of multiple studies involving TLR7 (see Additional file : Table S10) tends to support the view that there is  indeed  only weak positive selection acting on TLR7. Interspecific comparisons within the Galloanserae clade revealed relatively high sequence variability in all three TLR investigated. Such variation has been shown to influence the physiochemical properties of proteins. Despite high tertiary-structure conservation  evolutionary changes were manifested by alterations to protein surface characteristics  such as changes in electrostatic potential distribution. Importantly  not only does surface charge in Galloanserae birds differ distinctly from that of mammals  to some extent there are also distinct differences observed within the clade. These variations most likely affect receptor binding features  a theory that is consistent with the idea of a host-pathogen evolutionary arms race [] in which any adaptation enabling a pathogen to escape host immunity leads inevitably to a counter-adaptation in host receptors that again enables pathogen detection. Co-evolution of this kind has previously been described in both human TLR4 and TLR4 of the bacterium []. In fact  there are now numerous examples of individual host TLR adaptations to pathogens known (summarised  for example  in []). What we presently lack  however  is a functional understanding of evolutionarily-tested beneficial innovations present at the interspecific level in vertebrates. In this study  selection analysis identified a number of positively selected sites  mostly in the ligand-binding ECD. As in previous studies  we observed stronger positive selection acting on the ligand-binding regions of TLR4 [] and TLR5 [] compared to TLR7 []. Sites subjected to selection in TLR4 and TLR5 were frequently located either precisely in  or in close topological proximity to  ligand-binding sites known or predicted in mammalian or fish TLR. This suggests that  although avian TLR may be differentially adapted to pathogen-derived ligand recognition compared to that of other vertebrate species  identical regions are responsible for ligand binding. We suggest that future investigations in this field should focus on functional testing of evolutionarily relevant substitutions detected by selection analyses. Based on the evidence summarised above  we propose several sites for more detailed investigation. In particular  sites 270  343  444 and 471 in TLR4 and sites 183  209  216  264  342 and 379 in TLR5 represent key candidates for further research on the functional significance of selection acting on TLR in birds. We suggest that site 268 (and possibly also site 383) in TLR4 and site 180 in TLR5 may be of particular evolutionary importance in Galloanserae birds since no selection on these sites has previously been observed in either mammals or other birds. Furthermore  while we do not know the functional importance of the sites  concordance between selection analyses in both birds and mammals suggests that special attention should be paid to positions 244–246  273–275  301 in TLR4 and 293  294  314  342  422  525  532  533 in TLR5. Taken together  our results have identified variability in Galloanserae birds that very likely results from pathogen-mediated evolution of species-specific TLR binding features. To our knowledge  this is the first study to depict evolutionary pressures on Galloanserae TLR and to estimate the validity of current knowledge on TLR function (based on mammalian and chicken models) for non-model species of this clade. Functional testing of the importance of individual sites (such as that performed by Walsh et al. [] in mammals) should provide novel understanding of evolutionary mechanisms increasing resistance to pathogens in avian species. Any knowledge gained would be of great practical relevance  with applications in animal breeding for increased resistance to diseases.

This study illustrates that sex is an important factor that influences phenotypic values and modifies the effects of the genetic variants that underlie complex traits in pigs; it also emphasizes the importance of stratifying by sex when performing GWAS. Males and females differ in many aspects  from their chromosomes (X vs. Y) to their body morphologies to their reproductive behaviors. In model organisms such as mice and   many traits ranging from gene expression levels [] to embryonic development [] have been reported to show sexual differences. Furthermore  the prevalence and severity of many common diseases in humans  such as type 2 diabetes [] and asthma []  also vary between men and women. The fact that a broad range of complex traits are sexually dimorphic indicates that males and females are characterized by important biological differences  which can modify the effects of genes on complex traits. Understanding sex-dependent differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits can help to generate insights into the evolution of males and females; it can also help in the development of sex-specific medical treatments in humans and breeding objectives in farm animals. Many traits in humans  such as gene expression levels []  blood metabolite levels []  and the prevalence of common diseases []  have been reported to have sexually dimorphic genetic architectures. Similar situations have also been documented in model organisms such as mice (e.g.  fat mass []) and  (e.g.  gene expression [])  which indicates that sexually dimorphic genetic control of complex traits is common across species. In contrast  the molecular basis of sex-specific genetic regulation of complex traits in pigs remains less explored. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic loci that affect complex traits in pigs  such as traits related to body composition []  hematology []  and disease susceptibility []. In a previous study  we conducted a large-scale White Duroc × Chinese Erhualian F cross  measured a variety of traits and obtained 60 K genotypes from more than 1000 F individuals. Using these data  we performed GWAS to identify the loci associated with various traits [] []. However  our previous study and most other GWAS in pigs did not explicitly consider the possibility of sex-specific differences in the genetic architecture underlying the traits examined. The associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits were simply assessed using linear models that treated sex as a fixed effect  which could have reduced the power to detect loci that demonstrated sex-specific differences. In this study  we used a sex-stratified GWAS to examine sex-specific differences in gene regulation using 213 traits in individuals from our large F pig experimental population. Data were obtained from a total of 921 F individuals of both sexes. All the male pigs were castrated when they were 90 days old; therefore  the influence of sex hormones was limited in this study. First  we evaluated sex-specific differences in the 213 traits using a linear regression model. Next  by comparing the genome-wide SNP-trait association signatures found in males versus females  we identified loci that displayed sexually dimorphic expression; these loci were associated with a variety of traits related to meat quality  fatty acid composition  food intake  and hematological parameters. This study emphasizes that sex is an important factor that can modify the effects of the genetic variants underlying complex traits in pigs. All the pigs used in this study were the product of a large-scale White Duroc × Erhualian F cross; the design and management of this experimental population have been described elsewhere []. Briefly  two White Duroc boars were mated to 17 Erhualian sows to generate the F pigs. Then  nine F boars were crossed with 59 F sows to produce 1912 F pigs (in six batches). All the F animals were raised at the Jiangxi Agricultural University experimental farm (Nanchang  China); they were fed  and weaned at the age of 46 days. The male pigs were castrated at the age of 90 days. The castrated males and the females lived in mixed pens and were treated equally throughout the experiment. All the F pigs were slaughtered at the age of 240 × 3 days; overall  we measured more than 400 traits in the F population. We obtained 60 K SNP genotypes from 1000 F pigs using porcine SNP60 Beadchips (Illumina). The procedures used to phenotype the pigs and obtain the 60 K genotypes have been described in previous publications []-[]. All animal work was conducted according to the guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals established by the Ministry of Agriculture of China. We investigated 213 traits in the F pigs produced by a large-scale White Duroc × Chinese Erhualian F cross. These traits are related to a broad range of characteristics  including growth  fatness  meat quality  hematological parameters  and serum glucose and lipid levels (See Additional file : Table S1). For the 213 traits examined  we obtained both phenotypic values and 60 K SNP genotypes for between 217 and 919 pigs; we had both sets of data for at least 100 individuals for both sexes. The quality control procedure used for the 60 K SNP genotype data and the details of the GWAS are the same as previously described []. Briefly  we retained samples with SNP call rates greater than 10% and Mendelian inconsistence rates smaller than 0.05; we kept SNPs with call rates higher than 0.9  minor allele frequencies higher than 0.05   values greater than 10 for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test and Mendelian error rates smaller than 0.1. These procedures were implemented in Plink v1.07 []. In total  39 454 SNPs and 921 individuals were used in the subsequent analyses. We log-transformed (log) the phenotypic values of any traits that strongly deviated from normality (Shapiro test  value <10). We assessed the significance of the effects of sex on the 213 traits examined using the  function in R []; batch was included as a fixed effect. To evaluate sex-specific differences in the genetic architecture of the 213 traits  we conducted a sex-stratified analysis in which we estimated trait heritability and performed separate GWAS for males versus females. We used the R package GenABEL []; batch was included as a fixed effect. Heritability was estimated based on a kinship matrix calculated from the 60 K SNP genotype data and using the  function. The associations between the SNP genotypes and the traits were evaluated using mixed linear models ( function). As in the previously described GWAS  sex and batch were fitted as fixed effects. We assessed the empirical significance of the difference in heritability between the two sexes using a permutation test []: for each trait  we shuffled the gender labels of individuals 1000 times to generate a null distribution of absolute differences in heritability between the two sexes. We evaluated the  values of the associations yielded by the GWAS after applying a Bonferroni correction. The suggestive significance level was set to 1/N where N was the number of SNPs tested in the GWAS; this threshold allowed one false positive association per genome scan. The genome-wide significance level was set to 0.05/N. To identify genetic variants associated with strong sexual dimorphism  we tested for sex-specific differences in SNP effects using an approach similar to the one described in []. Briefly  we calculated the z-statistics as follows: where  and  are the SNP effects estimated in males and females  respectively  and  and  are the standard errors of those SNP effects. Given the null hypothesis that SNP effects in males and female were equal  the z-statistic has a standard normal distribution. Single-tailed tests were used to evaluate the significance of any sex-specific difference. The significance level was set using the Bonferroni approach described above. To avoid spurious signals caused by low minor allele frequencies (MAF) in either sex  we exclude SNPs with MAF values of less than 5% (in males or females). We used a simple linear regression model to look for sex-specific differences in phenotypic values. Of the 213 traits examined  102 showed significant sex-specific differences (q value [] <0.05). Out of these 102 traits  20 had q values greater than 1 × 10; these traits were related to fatness  fatty acid composition  growth and meat pH values (See Additional file : Table S2). Generally  males had greater abdominal fat weight (Figure A)  greater intramuscular fat content (Figure B)  greater leaf fat weight and higher levels of saturated fatty acids in both their fat and muscle tissues. Abdominal fat weight appeared to be the most significant sexually dimorphic trait (q value = 7.9 × 10); on average  males had 72 g more abdominal fat than did females (Figure A). Moreover  the meat of male pigs had a higher pH. In contrast  females had higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids and a higher average daily gain from 21 to 46 days old (q value = 1 × 10) (Figure C and D). Males and females showed a range of differences (from 0.74 to 1.58 fold) in their phenotypic values; most traits differed by more than 50% between the two sexes (See Additional file : Table S2).  Four selected traits for which phenotypic values significantly differed between males and females. The error bars denote the standard errors associated with the average phenotypic values in either sex.  Comparison of the heritability of the 213 traits in males and females. Each dot represents a trait  and colors of the dots denote the trait categories. We also estimated the heritability of the 213 traits examined using separate male and female kinship matrices constructed using the autosomal 60 K SNP genotype data (see Methods section). Trait heritability was significantly correlated between males and females (Spearman correlation r = 0.65   = 3.94 × 10) (See Additional file : Table S3) (Figure E). We found 24 traits that showed significant sex-specific differences in heritability (empirical  value <0.05). For instance  meat quality  forward gait score at 223 days old  platelet distribution width and serum glucose levels were more heritable in males than in females (See Additional file : Table S3) (Figure E). In contrast  fatty acid composition  weight at 46 days old and skin thickness were more heritable in females (See Additional file : Table S3) (Figure E). A trait with greater heritability is a trait for which a greater degree of phenotypic variance can be accounted for by genetic variants. This result indicates the importance of the sexually dimorphic genetic architecture that underlies these traits in pigs. To investigate the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism of traits  we performed a sex-stratified GWAS and assessed sex-specific differences in the allelic effects at each SNP locus using z-statistics [] (see Methods section); this analysis revealed the extent of sex-specific genetic effects of particular SNPs on target traits. A total of 22 traits related to meat quality  fatty acid composition  hematological parameters and food intake were controlled by 43 significant ( <2.5 × 10) sexually dimorphic loci (See Additional file : Table S4). Of these 43 loci  41 (95.3%) were on autosomes. The most significant signatures ( = 4.8 × 10) were detected for hue angle (H*) value at 45 minutes post-slaughter (Figure A). Hue angle is a meat color parameter related to Minolta b* (yellowness) and a* (redness) values  which can be calculated as H* = arctan(b*/a*). This locus exhibited a significant male-specific association (Figure B) but negligible association in females (Figure D). It should be noted that this locus was not detected in the GWAS that included both males and females (combined GWAS). This locus also showed a male-specific association with Minolta a* at 45 minutes post-slaughter  which is another meat redness parameter. Other notable traits associated with significant sexually dimorphic loci include stearic acid (C18:0) levels in muscle  food intake and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations (see Additional file : Table S4).

The dashed and solid horizontal lines represent suggestive and genome-wide significance thresholds.  and  Regional plots of GWAS signals on chromosome 6 for males  and females .  and  Distribution of phenotypic values for the three SNP genotypes most associated with the  muscle hue angle values in males  and females . We compared the significant signals obtained in the sex-stratified GWAS with the significant signals obtained in the combined GWAS. Between the sex-stratified GWAS and the combined GWAS  we identified a total of 16 996 significant SNPs ( value <2.5 × 10) associated with the 213 traits. Of these SNPs  70.5% were detected by both approaches. Notably  2035 significant SNPs were detected only by the sex-stratified GWAS; this corresponds to 13.6% of the loci detected by the combined GWAS (Figure A). As a consequence  this result suggests that 13.6% more loci can be identified by using a sex-stratified GWAS in addition to a combined GWAS. We found that the values of the z-statistics associated with the new SNPs revealed by the sex-stratified GWAS were located in the tail of z-statistic distribution (Figure B) ( test  value = 2.3 × 10). This finding indicates that most of these new SNPs have sex-specific effects. Therefore  their signatures were weakened in the combined GWAS.

Comparison of the distribution of the sex-specific signals (significance of the z- statistics) of all the SNPs and the 2035 additional significant trait-associated SNPs detected by the sex-stratified GWAS. GWAS have become a powerful tool for detecting genetic variants associated with complex traits in pigs. Although studies in humans and model organisms have demonstrated the importance of sexual dimorphism in the genetic architecture of complex traits  to date nearly all the GWAS performed in pigs have ignored sex-specific effects or sex-by-genotype interactions  which means that they have possibly missed an opportunity to identify genetic variants that act differently in males and females. To study sex-specific genetic effects on complex traits in pigs  we conducted a sex-stratified GWAS using 921 (507 males +414 females) F pigs produced by a White Duroc × Erhualian F cross. In contrast to human GWAS  the pigs in this GWAS were raised under the same controlled conditions and were fed a uniform diet; furthermore  most traits were phenotypically characterized at the same time (after slaughter). These experimental features have largely reduced the level of environmental noise and increased the ability to detect sexually dimorphic loci. Indeed  we were able to identify many extremely significant loci associated with traits related to meat quality []  fatty acid composition []  hematological parameters [] and blood lipid levels []  which suggests that the data obtained in this study can contribute to the identification of sex-specific genetic effects on complex traits. Sex hormones are important factors that mediate sexually dimorphic gene expression in mice []. It should be noted that all the male pigs in this study were castrated when they were 90 days old. Therefore  the sex-specific effects identified in this study are less likely to have been caused by gonadal hormones than by sex chromosome dosage compensation or other unknown factors. Of the 213 traits examined  102 demonstrated significant sex-specific differences. Some of these traits were related to growth  fatness  meat quality  serum lipid levels and hematological parameters. These results indicate that sex is an important factor that affects the phenotypic values of various traits in pigs  even in the absence of the influence of sex hormones. Some traits showed a highly significant degree of sexual dimorphism (q value <10); for instance  we found that the castrated males studied in our study tended to accumulate more abdominal fat  leaf fat and intramuscular fat and that they had higher levels of saturated fatty acids in their fat and muscle tissue than females. From the standpoint of food quality  this result indicates that pork from castrated male pigs might taste better since IMF content is related to meat juiciness and flavor. In contrast  females grew faster during the early stages of life (from 21 to 46 days) and had higher levels of unsaturated fatty acids in their tissues; this result indicates that pork from female pigs might be healthier since foods containing a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids are better for human health []. These results support that sex does influence a broad range of traits in pigs. Using genome-wide SNP genotypes to estimate the heritability of complex traits has proven to be feasible []. Furthermore  genetic component analyses using pedigree data have illustrated that significantly different types of genetic architectures underlie multiple traits related to body composition in humans []. However  few studies have examined differences in the heritability of complex traits between males and females using genotype data. Here  we estimated trait heritability separately in males and females using 60 K SNP genotypes. We found that the heritability of 22 traits differed significantly between males and females; some of these traits are related to waist vertebrae number  growth at an early age  platelet distribution width and serum glucose levels. Remarkably  we also found clusters of traits related to fatty acid composition and meat quality. Setting statistical significance aside  we found that SNP-genotype-based heritability was higher in females than in males for 35 (79.5%) of the 44 traits related to the fatty acid composition of fat or muscle tissues and for all of the fatness traits (Figure E) (see Additional file : Table S3). This finding indicates that genetic variants accounted for more of the variance in traits related to fatty acid composition and fatness in females than in males. In contrast  the heritability of most of the meat quality traits including temperature  pH  and the color of  muscle and  muscle at various time points post-slaughter was higher in males than in females (Figure E) (see Additional file : Table S3). Although these results could be biased by the presence of correlations between traits  they nonetheless illustrate that the genetic architecture that underlies certain categories of traits differed between the two sexes. This is possibly due to different evolutionary pressures imposed by natural and artificial selection that act to alter the molecular pathways that shape these traits in males versus females. Compared to the combined GWAS (which included both males and females)  the sex-stratified GWAS identified 13.6% more loci associated with the traits. This percentage of novel loci identified by the sex-stratified GWAS is similar to what has been found in studies of gene expression traits in humans []. This result illustrates the importance of performing sex-stratified GWAS or including a sex-by-genotype interaction in routine GWAS. To identify sexually dimorphic loci associated with the traits being examined  we scanned the whole genome to compare the effects of SNPs in the two sexes. The most significant sexually dimorphic loci were found between 9.3 and 10.7 Mb on chromosome 6; they were associated with hue angle and Minolta a* values at 45 min post slaughter  which are color parameters that reflect meat redness. Meat color is an important feature for consumers since it reflects meat quality and freshness. It has been reported that ~90% of the variance in the color parameters of  muscle in pigs can be explained by pigment content and myoglobin forms []. Moreover  the Minolta a* value has been reported to be significantly correlated with myoglobin expression in muscle in Pietrain pigs []. Presumably  the underlying genetic variants could affect pigment content or myoglobin content  which in turn could affect meat color. Using UCSC online gene annotation tools  we searched for candidate genes in a 1-Mb region around the SNPs that were significantly associated with hue angle values; the  gene ()  located at 10.1 Mb on chromosome 6 is of particular interest. This gene plays an important role in heme biosynthesis  and overexpression of  has been associated with reduced heme biosynthesis in pig skeletal muscle []. In mice  the hypomethylation of  in female offspring can be induced by high levels of maternal folic acid during gestation []  which indicates that sex-specific epigenetic modification of this gene might be responsible for the sex-specific signals detected by the GWAS. We found that 41 (95.3%) of the 43 significant sexually dimorphic loci were autosomal. This result is not unexpected since many health-related traits  such as fat distribution in humans  have also been observed to be associated with sexually dimorphic loci located on autosomes []. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these autosomal sexually dimorphic loci are not clear. Possible explanations are that sex-specific effects could contribute to heritable epigenetic differences between males and females [] or that these differences are mediated by the different sex chromosomes found in males versus females. We checked whether the 22 traits that were associated with significant sexually dimorphic loci demonstrated significantly different phenotypic values for males versus females. We found that 12 (54.4%) of the 22 traits did not have sex-specific phenotypic values (q >0.05). However  not one of the top five traits i.e. abdominal fat weight; C16:1  C18:0 and C20:3 levels in abdominal fat; and the saturated fatty acid content of muscle that demonstrated sex-specific phenotypic values (q <10) were associated with significant sexually dimorphic loci. These results suggest that even if phenotypic values differ significantly between the two sexes  it does not necessarily mean that strong sex-specific genetic controls are in place  and vice versa. Similar results have been reported for gene expression traits in humans []. In this study  we looked for evidence of sexual dimorphism in the phenotypic values of and the genetic variants associated with 213 traits related to a broad range of pig traits. Some of these traits  namely those related to growth  fatness  meat quality and palatability  are of economic importance. The results of this study have improved our understanding of the relationship between sex and complex traits. About half of the 213 traits examined in this study showed significant sex-specific differences in their phenotypic values  which demonstrates that sex is an important factor that influences the phenotypic values of quantitative traits in pigs even when the influence exerted by sex hormones is limited. The sex-stratified GWAS revealed the existence of a landscape of sex-specific genetic effects on a variety of pig traits and demonstrated that sex-specific regulation is an important aspect of the genetic architecture that underlies complex traits. Our results suggest that future GWAS should stratify their analyses by sex or incorporate a sex-by-genotype interaction to identify sexually dimorphic loci associated with complex traits in pigs and other organisms.

Furthermore  when using a multi-line training dataset  non-linear models provided information on the genotype data that was complementary to the linear models  which indicates that the underlying data distributions of the three studied lines were indeed heterogeneous. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) are generally predicted by a regression model [] trained by a set of animals with known phenotypes and genotypes for a dense marker panel that covers the genome []. Prediction accuracy of such models depends on several factors  among which size of the set of training animals is most important  which has been addressed in several studies [] [] that consistently claim that the biggest limitation for the accuracy of genomic prediction of livestock is the number of animals with both genotype and phenotype data. In most cases  the number of markers is however substantially larger than the number of training samples. This means that genomic prediction typically has a small sample-to-size ratio  which is also known as a  <<  problem []. One of the major disadvantages is that  <<  may lead to a severe over-fitting problem  which may affect the accuracy of the predictions in a validation dataset. Dimension reduction [] [] could be an alternative approach to retain the most relevant information of the genotype data [] [] in a low-dimensional vector space. Our study aimed at investigating a more straightforward and feasible approach to alleviate the  < <  problem  which consists of enlarging the training set by using data from multiple populations. However  studies on across-breed genomic prediction using 50 k genotypes have shown that the use of a multi-breed training dataset typically results in a limited or no increase in accuracy compared to using training data from a single breed []-[]. Previous studies have hypothesized that in order to successfully combine training datasets of Holstein-Friesian and Jersey dairy cattle breeds  genotypes on at least 300 000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) should be used []. Besides insufficient SNP density  another reason that may explain the limited increase in prediction accuracy observed when using multi-population compared to single-population training data could be that the commonly used models cannot deal appropriately with heterogeneous multi-population data. To date  all across-population genomic prediction studies have used linear models. These linear models generally assume that the effect of a SNP in one population is the same in another population. This assumption can be violated due to several reasons. First  the linkage disequilibrium (LD) may differ between populations. Second  it is quite likely that at least some of the segregating QTL (quantitative trait loci) are population-specific. Third  the absolute effect of a QTL may differ between populations because of differences in genetic background. The assumption of linearity may be too rigorous for any of these situations  especially when using the common 50 k SNP chip. In fact  if differences between populations or lines are too large  predictive ability of across-breed genomic prediction with linear models may be lower than that of within-breed genomic prediction []. A few studies have proposed to use multi-trait linear models []-[]  where trait by line combinations are modelled as separate but correlated traits  to try to accommodate these issues. As an alternative solution  we propose to use non-linear models by kernel learning [] [] []. The basic idea is to predict the breeding value of a test animal using a limited number of training animals with similar genotypes that do not necessarily come from a single population. By doing so  the entire heterogeneous data space spanned by genotypes is decomposed into a large number of locally homogeneous sub-areas []-[]  regardless of their population of origin. Such a model might be able to extract the useful information across populations. At the very least  the non-linear models by kernel learning are expected to better capture the heterogeneous nature of the data compared to linear models. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of multi-line genomic prediction using non-linear models by kernel learning and a linear model that modelled trait by line combinations as separate but correlated traits  and to compare the prediction accuracy of these models to that of commonly used linear genomic prediction models presented by Calus et al. []. This comparison was performed with a dataset that included three lines of layer hens. Linear regression models [] have been widely used to implement genomic prediction []. In concrete terms  the ultimate goal of a regression task is to predict an unseen value  from a vector of observations/features . In the scenario of genomic prediction  (  ) corresponds to genotypes () and phenotypes () of  training individuals. Linear regression uses a linear function to map the observations  to the responsible value  by a vector  as the linear weights on : where the weight vector  can be estimated using the training data. To best approximate the underlying functional relationship between  and  by Equation ()  ridge regression aims at minimizing the average quadratic loss () between the true response value  and : The vector  refers to a column vector [    …   ] that contains the phenotypes of all training animals  while the matrix  contains the genotypes of all training animals. The norm of  is the regularization term. Adding it into the objective function alleviates the over-fitting problem  which might be detrimental to prediction performance since the number of genotypes is generally much larger than the number of training samples. Parameter  refers to the weight given to the regularization term. Minimization of the loss function  by Equation () with regard to  results in the following estimate: If the following matrix lemma [] is applied: the solution to * can be reformulated to: With this estimate  the prediction * based on the test vector  becomes: These descriptions provide the basis for the development of the non-linear models presented below. For comparison  we included two linear models  i.e. ridge-regression based on principal component analysis (RRPCA) and genome-enabled best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) []. More detailed descriptions of these models  and the results obtained with these models on this data  are in []. One of the disadvantages of linear regression is that the underlying data structures might not be well characterized by the linear weights. In genomic prediction  this implies that the estimated effects are not necessarily strictly additive genetic effects []  and in the context of multi-breed genomic prediction  this may be further interpreted as the true SNP effects not being the same in different breeds or lines. One straightforward approach to allow estimated SNP effects to differ between lines  is to use a multi-trait GBLUP (MTGBLUP) model that allows genetic correlations between the lines to differ from 1 []. The data available was not large enough to estimate these correlations; however  additional data was available on non-genotyped animals for each line. Therefore  pairwise genetic correlations between lines were estimated by applying REML (restricted maximum likelihood) [] with a model that used the inverse of a combined pedigree and genomic relationship matrix [] that included all three lines. Using this combined relationship matrix  the number of training records ranged from 24 906 to 27 896 across the three lines  while when only genotyped animals were considered  it ranged from 1004 to 1023. Using the estimated variance components  the MTGBLUP model was run using a G-matrix as described in []  such that only genotyped animals were included in the reference population. Another interpretation of the expectation that the underlying data structures across breeds or lines might not be well characterized by the linear weights is that the inherent mapping function might not be linear. To capture such data features  the common tandem is to adopt a non-linear function (.) { <U+2192> ()}. The non-linear function results in new representations of genotypes that may be associated with both additive and non-additive effects [] []. Accordingly  Equation () can be modified by replacing  by (): where () contains the transformed genotypes using (). Interestingly  the predictor does not necessarily depend on the mapping function () but on the inner products between the vectors () and ()  namely ()()  as a result of the following terms in (): ()(): the element of the resultant matrix on the  th column and  th row is ()()  ()(): the  th element of the resultant vector is ()(). This property implies that the design of the kernel function (  ) = ()() is sufficient to give rise to the predictor without any knowledge on the mapping function (): where  is a matrix with elements (  )     = 1 2 …   and  is a vector with elements (  )   = 1 2 …  . One possible interpretation of kernel learning is that the kernel function of two vectors  and   (  )  to some extent describes the similarity between  and  by tending to yield a relatively large value when  is similar to . There are two typical approaches to evaluate the similarity of two vectors: cross-correlation  and distance (  ). Both of these are intrinsically related:  is inversely proportional to (  ) if the measure  is Euclidean distance: (  ) =   -   =    +    - 2. Therefore  in this study both cross-correlation-based kernels [] [] and distance-based kernels []-[] that use those two similarity measures were used. The polynomial kernel is the most classical cross-correlation-based kernel [] [] that depends on the inner product of two vectors: This kernel maps the original feature space into one that is spanned by monomials of degree . A more general definition of the polynomial kernel is: which is called an inhomogeneous polynomial kernel since a unit shift is added onto the inner product of two vectors. Compared with the homogeneous kernel given by Equation ()  the explicit mapping function of this kernel contains all monomials whose degrees are equivalent to or smaller than . Similarity can also be measured by the distance : if  and  are similar  the function value of (  ) should be small. Mathematically speaking  the distance function should satisfy the following three properties: (  ) =   (  ) = (  )  (  ) < (  ) + (  ). Then  a valid kernel can be constructed by the following equation: Distance-based kernels are derived from -norm distance  which has been proven to satisfy the aforementioned requirements []: Two well-known distance kernels are special cases of this general equation: the radial basis function (RBF) kernel ( = 2  also known as Gaussian kernel) [] and the Laplacian Kernel ( = 1) []: In our study  accuracy of genomic prediction based on multi-line training was evaluated for two non-linear models that were based on two different kernels that are the most representative of the two categories of kernels described in the previous section []. The first uses the RBF kernel and is termed “RBF” hereafter  and the second uses the polynomial kernel and is termed “Poly” hereafter. Linear regression  also known as ridge regression (RR)  is a special case of kernel linear regression that adopts the linear kernel []. A method equivalent to RR  i.e. GBLUP that uses a genomic relationship matrix []  is applied here for comparison. Considering that the number of SNPs is relatively large compared to the number of animals with phenotypes  all models were also implemented after performing principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data dimensions while still explaining 97% of the variance of the SNP genotypes in the data. These three models are termed RRPCA for RR  RBFPCA for RBF kernel based linear regression and PolyPCA for polynomial kernel based linear regression. To compare the models  data of two brown and one white lines of layer chickens were analysed. The brown layer lines B1 and B2 were closely related to each other  while the white line (W1) was only distantly related to the brown lines. The phenotype data used was the number of eggs in the first production period until the hens reach the age of 24 weeks. Across the three lines  3753 female birds had both phenotypes and genotypes for 45 974 SNPs from the chicken 60 k Illumina Infinium iSelect Beadchip [] after editing. More details on the dataset and on the editing of the SNP data are described in Calus et al. []. Seven different training sets and one validation set per line were defined to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction with single- and multi-line training datasets. For each line  the youngest generation  containing 238 to 240 birds  was used as a validation set. Breeding values for the validation animals were predicted using phenotypes of the training set  which were pre-corrected for hatch week. For the validation animals  the correlation coefficient between the GEBV and their observed phenotypes were computed to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction with various training datasets. These correlations are hereafter referred to as ‘predictive correlations’. Commonly  such correlations are divided by the square root of the heritability of the trait to reflect the accuracies of predictions of true breeding values. In this case  we did not do that  because such an adjustment assumes that all the captured genetic variance is additive  while the kernel functions may capture some non-additive effects. Approximate standard errors of the predictive correlations were computed using the expected sampling variance of an estimated correlation ()  as  where  is the number of training animals []. The coefficient of the regression of phenotypes on GEBV () was computed to evaluate bias of the predictions. Standard errors of the regression coefficients  denoted as   were derived with bootstrapping  which involved computing regression coefficients for 10 000 bootstrapping samples of the 238 to 240 validation animals  using the R-package “boot” []. The regression coefficients were considered as not significantly different from 1 when []. The first three training sets consisted of one of the three lines. The next three training sets included each of the three pairwise combinations of the three lines. The last training set included layers from all three lines. The resulting training sets included ~1000 to 3000 animals  and the number of segregating SNPs ranged from 30 508 to 45 974 []. The estimated genetic correlations between the three lines are in Table . The genetic correlation between lines B1 and B2 was equal to 0.63  thus significantly larger than 0  which confirms that B1 and B2 are closely related lines. Genetic correlations between lines B1 and W1 and between lines B2 and W1 were equal to -0.26 and -0.55  respectively. The large standard errors of these estimates show that the estimated genetic correlation between line B1 and W1 is not significantly different from 0  while the correlation between B2 and W1 is significantly lower than 0. Tables    and  show the predictive correlations for each line of six methods using seven training datasets. In the following  we first describe results across the training datasets and then differences between the methods. Table  shows the predictive correlations of line B1 across the training datasets. The impact of multi-line training for line B1 differed slightly between models. Results of the two models with the highest predictive correlations are discussed as examples. The GBLUP model achieved the highest predictive correlation when the model was trained exclusively on data from line B1. In other words  enlarging the training set by adding the training animals from any other line deteriorated the prediction performance. However  the second best model  namely RBF  which had a performance that was slightly inferior to that of the GBLUP model  benefited slightly from enhancing training with data from other lines. Table  contains the predictive correlations for line B2. Compared to the scenario for which the training dataset only contained line B2  both linear models GBLUP and RRPCA had a ~0.03 higher predictive correlation with multi-line prediction. Predictive correlations for the non-linear models were  however  very similar to each other across the training datasets. Interestingly  focussing on the results for line B1 with training on data from line B2 only  or vice versa  the predictive correlations of the linear and RBF models were clearly superior to those of the Poly models. This suggests that the genotypes of lines B1 and B2 shared some structural similarities that benefitted the predictions of the linear and RBF models. In these situations  the Poly models resulted in predictive correlations that were generally close to 0. Table  shows the predictive correlations for the line W1 validation data. Predictive correlations were very similar across models and training datasets whenever line W1 was included in the training data. When line W1 was not included in the training data  the predictive correlations were always negative  except for MTGBLUP and the Poly models. Overall  the benefit of multi-line training was limited  and only clearly observed in a few cases when the training data included a closely related line  e.g. lines B1 and B2. Therefore  enlarging the training set with unrelated or distantly related animals did not significantly improve predictive correlations. Bias of genomic predictions was assessed by evaluating coefficients of the regression of phenotypes on GEBV. Bias decreases as regression coefficients get closer to 1. For all three lines (See Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3)  bias was more controlled for all models if the evaluated line was included in the training data  otherwise  large biases were observed  especially for the non-linear (Poly and RBF) models. These results indicate that GBLUP  RRPCA  MTGBLUP and RBFPCA gave reasonable results in terms of bias  as long as the evaluated line or a closely related line was included in the training dataset. Among the non-linear models  the Poly models generally performed worse than the RBF models  both in terms of predictive correlations (Tables    and ) and bias (See Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3)  when the evaluated line was included in the training data. In addition  the predictions of the Poly models had close to 0 predictive correlations and very large biases when based on information from a closely related line (lines B1 and B2). In the comparison between linear and non-linear models  it is important to note that the non-linear RBF models yielded predictive correlations that were comparable to those of the best linear models (either GBLUP or RRPCA) for lines B1 and W1 when the training data included all lines (Tables  and ). For line B2  RBF performed better than the GBLUP model  while RRPCA had the highest predictive correlation in all scenarios (Table ). For line B1  however  RRPCA had a lower predictive correlation than the RBF and GBLUP models (Table ). For lines B1 and B2  the MTGBLUP model generally yielded predictive correlations that were similar to those of most of the other models (Tables  and ). The same was observed for W1 when W1 was included in the training data (Table ). However  when W1 was not included in the training data  MTGBLUP yielded positive predictive correlations but almost all other models yielded negative predictive correlations. In summary  the results show that the performance of RBF models was fairly similar to that of the linear models  and that the Poly models generally performed worse. The MTGBLUP model in some situations could generate positive predictive correlations when the trait had a negative correlation between the evaluated line and the line(s) included in the training data. Because linear and non-linear models focus on different aspects of the genomic data  in this subsection  we analysed the complementarity between models. One way to measure the complementarity between two approaches is based on the correlation between their predictions. Correlations of genomic predictions were computed between models for the training dataset that included all three lines (Table ). In general  predictions from the Poly models had the lowest correlations with those of other models  which is in line with the observation that  in most cases  the Poly models had the poorest performance in terms of predictive correlation. Ignoring the Poly models  the correlations between predictions from the different models were generally high (>0.9) for line W1. For lines B1 and B2  the predictions from the RBF models had correlations lower than 0.9 with those of GBLUP and RRPCA and higher than 0.9 with those of MTGBLUP. The prediction from the MTGBLUP model deviated substantially from those of GBLUP  with correlations of 0.91 to 0.98. The level of the correlations showed that combining predictions of different models could lead to more accurate predictions. The potential of such an approach was investigated by evaluating combined predictions of two models. A weighted combination of two predictions (  )  can be easily obtained using the following equation: where parameter  defines the weight given to the two approaches. When  is equal to 0 or 1  the combination is reduced to either of the two predictions. Figure  shows the predictive correlations of this combined prediction for the linear models GBLUP and RRPCA and the non-linear model RBF. In Figure   each row represents the results for one combination of models and each column represents the results for one of the lines. For line B1  combining predictions from a linear and a non-linear model improved the predictive correlation  especially for the combination of GBLUP and RBF. For line B2  there was little gain by combining models  which is probably due to the superior performance of the RRPCA model. For line W1  the combined prediction was in all cases slightly more accurate. Interestingly  across all situations  the benefit of combining predictions of two models was largest when the two models had a similar predictive correlation.  In each sub-figure i.e. “GBLUP/RRPCA  B1” means that the prediction is a combination of the predictions of models GBLUP and RRPCA and evaluated on line B1. For practical applications of genomic prediction in livestock  it is important that the predictions can be computed efficiently. Therefore  in this section  we analytically evaluate the computational complexity of linear and non-linear models. Revisiting both prediction models  they can be generalized by the following expression: where  is the vector of training phenotypes. For the linear model   =  and  =  (referring to Equation ())  while for the non-linear model  =  and  =  (referring to Equation ()). The computation cost depends heavily on the inversion of matrix ( +  )  which is o() []. Parameter  is equal to the dimension of matrix . The computational complexity of the linear and non-linear models depends on the size of matrix   which is  ×  (i.e. ridge regression BLUP) or  ×  (i.e. GBLUP) for the linear models and  ×  for the non-linear models implemented in our study  which means that the complexities are either o() or o(). In genomic prediction  the number of genotypes () is typically much larger than the number of training animals (). When ridge regression is used in the linear model (i.e. matrix  is of size  × ) and combined with the use of PCA (i.e. RRPCA in our case)  the size of the matrix decreases to less than  ×   because the number of retained principal components will have a maximum value of -1 []. Therefore  computational complexity of the non-linear models implemented in our study is comparable to that of the linear GBLUP model  as summarized in Table . Thus  the non-linear models are expected to be able to deal with datasets of similar size as the commonly used GBLUP model. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of multi-line genomic prediction when using non-linear or linear models. In general  when the evaluated line was included in the training data  the non-linear RBF models yielded similar predictive correlations as the linear models. The non-linear models appeared to be slightly less sensitive to the structure of multi-line training datasets. For example  some of the linear models showed small decreases in predictive correlations for lines B1 and W1 when adding other lines []  but this did not (or rarely) occur for the non-linear models. When only information from a closely related line was used for training  the linear models and the non-linear RBF models had similar performance  indicating that the strong assumptions of the linear models may at least partly hold for the closely related lines used in our study. Our expectation was that the non-linear models would be better able to use relevant information  without making strong assumptions as done in the linear models [] []  but the results showed that  overall  the linear models and non-linear RBF models performed similarly. The complementarity analysis is another aspect of our study. It has been shown that combining genomic predictions of different models  a procedure also known as “bagging” []  may lead to more robust predictions with generally a higher accuracy [] or at the very least result in similar accuracies as achieved with the underlying models []. In our study  except for line B2  for which RRPCA performed significantly better than any other model  both measures of complementarity indicated that combining linear and non-linear models has the potential to result in slightly more accurate predictions  which means that the linear models capture different features of the data than the non-linear models. The fact that non-linear models captured some predictive variation that was not explained by linear models may be partly due to the ability of non-linear models to capture non-additive effects. Since many non-additive effects are not passed onto the next generation  predictions from non-linear models may be less useful for achieving genetic gain than the linear models. Nevertheless  capturing non-additive effects does help to better predict the performance of an animal itself. Another focus of this study was to investigate whether the potential benefit of multi-line genomic prediction depends on the genomic similarities of the lines considered. We showed that only some of the lines benefitted from multi-line training  which is consistent with previous studies e.g. [] []. The genotype data of the lines analysed in this work were apparently quite heterogeneous and thus  there was no consistent gain in predictive correlations from using multi-line training data. In some situations  there was a small benefit for lines B1 and B2 but not for W1. This was as expected based on results of the genotype-distance matrix reported by Calus et al. []  that showed that animals from lines B1 and B2 were more closely related than animals from lines B1 or B2 with animals from line W1. Training data for which relationships with the predicted data are poor  are expected to have negligible contributions to the non-linear predictor. In contrast  the distance between two individuals from lines B1 and B2 was relatively small  indicating that the properties of the genotypes of these two lines were similar. These properties include allele frequencies and LD. Similarities between populations in both of these properties were shown to be closely related to genomic relationships between populations []. This might explain the improvement in predictive correlations for lines B1 and B2 in some scenarios when line B1 or B2 was added to the training data. Indeed  the estimated genetic correlations between the lines revealed that the trait investigated was highly correlated between lines B1 and B2. There was  however  no clear improvement in or even deterioration of predictive correlations for lines B1 and B2 when line W1 was included in training  or vice versa. However  across several linear models  positive predictive correlations of 0.10 to 0.14  although not significantly greater than 0  were consistently obtained for line B2 when only line W1 was used for training []. Moreover  genetic correlations were equal to -0.26 between lines B1 and W1 and -0.55 between lines B2 and W1  which suggests that information of line W1 was not useful for lines B1 and B2 and vice versa. In summary  a benefit from using multi-line training is especially expected when lines share several common properties  which can be characterized by genomic relationships between lines. Estimating the genetic correlation of the trait between lines may also be very informative. If the distance between the lines is very large and if the estimated correlation is close to 0 or even negative  the benefit of using multi-line genomic prediction is expected to be very limited. Another interesting conclusion of the comparison between models for the three lines is that no single model was superior over all others for each scenario  which is similar to the results obtained when comparing different linear models []. The MTGBLUP model did not necessarily perform better than the other models for lines B1 and B2  but was able to yield substantial positive predictive correlations for line W1 when line B1  B2  or both were used for training. However  when line W1 was used to predict lines B1 and B2  MTGBLUP performed considerably worse than the other linear models. For predicting line B2  RRPCA performed much better than the other models. Interestingly  for line B2  the RBFPCA model was also more advantageous than the other regression models. For predicting line W1  all models performed quite similar whenever line W1 itself was included in the training data. As an important criterion for model evaluation  the bias of the genomic predictions was evaluated (See Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3). First  when training and validation data were from the same line  the bias was limited for all models. The genotype distance between a brown hen and a white hen is relatively large such that the kernel value of those two genotypes by Equation () becomes small. Therefore  the variance of the GEBV becomes small and the bias accordingly can become very large. In other words  the non-linear models may yield realistic predictive correlations close to 0 combined with very large biases  while the strong assumptions of the linear model appear to control the bias  but at the same time may result in poor predictive correlations. These results highlight the importance of evaluating bias as well as accuracy if the predicted line or breed is not represented in the training data. Conversely  our results show that including the evaluated line in the training data is the best way to control the bias of the predictions  regardless of the model used. By achieving a significant reduction in the dimension of genotypes  PCA is shown to benefit non-linear models  similar to what has been observed for the linear RRPCA model []. Concentrating on the non-linear kernel model that produced the highest predictive correlations  i.e. the RBF kernel  PCA had a minor impact on the predictive correlations  as shown by the correlation between the predictions from RBF and RBFPCA. This might be explained by the nature of the non-linear model: the prediction depends heavily on the distance relationships between training and testing animals  which are not altered by PCA. The Poly models also had very similar predictions whether PCA was performed or not. Regardless  the performance of Poly models was generally worse than that of other models  suggesting that they should not be considered for genomic prediction. Overall  our results with the non-linear RBF and linear RRPCA models suggest that dimensionality reduction of the genotype data might be helpful to decrease computational complexity while hardly affecting model accuracy. In this study  we investigated genomic prediction with multi-line data. Considering the possible complex heterogeneous data distributions of genotypes in such data  we used non-linear models by kernel linear regression  which rely on the similarity among animals but do not make assumptions on the linearity of genotypes  as the conventional linear models do. On this basis  it was anticipated that the non-linear models would capture different features of multi-line data than the linear models. Our results indicate that the non-linear RBF models had very similar prediction performance as the generally used linear model GBLUP. Using one line to predict performance in another closely related line  yielded similar prediction accuracies with the RBF and the considered linear models  which suggests that the genotypes of closely related lines share some structural similarities. This was supported by the estimated genetic correlation of 0.63 between the trait in the two closely related lines. Using only data from a distantly related line for prediction with a linear model resulted sometimes in -small positive predictive correlations  in a few cases in considerable negative predictive correlations  and sometimes in predictions with very large bias. This suggests that genomic prediction using only information from a distantly related line or breed should be avoided. Furthermore  despite the similar predictive correlations  linear and non-linear models were shown to capture some complementary predictive information  since the combined prediction slightly improved the predictive correlations. de los Campos G  Hickey JM  Pong-Wong R  Daetwyler HD  Calus MPL: Whole-genome regression and prediction methods applied to plant and animal breeding. 2013  193:327-345.

A standard approach for selecting the optimal set of PC in PCR remains a challenge. For many years  dairy cattle breeding programs have been very successful in identifying the best animals via progeny-testing schemes. Progeny-testing was first implemented in Denmark and was soon used all over the world []. One drawback of the progeny-testing scheme in dairy cattle breeding is the long generation intervals  which limits the response to selection  despite the high accuracy of selection achieved. In order to reduce the generation interval by trying to obtain more accurate estimated breeding values (EBV) before progeny information is available  the use of molecular markers in connection with phenotypes to predict genetic merit has been investigated for some time []. Recent advances in molecular techniques have made large-scale applications of such techniques possible. In 2001  Meuwissen et al. [] showed by simulation that genome-wide dense markers can adequately be used to estimate breeding values with a considerably high accuracy. Prediction of these EBV based on marker information is known as genomic prediction  and the subsequent selection step is known as genomic selection (GS). In GS  DNA information is used to predict the genetic merit of young animals  in order to reduce generation intervals. In recent years  GS has been implemented in dairy cattle breeding programs []-[] and has been described as the most promising molecular application in livestock []. In practise  genomic prediction involves two steps. First  the effect of each SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) is estimated in a reference population that consists of animals with both known phenotypes and marker genotypes. In the second step  genomic breeding values (GEBV) of young animals are estimated using only their marker information  to rank the animals for selection. Despite the fact that several methods have been presented to estimate SNP effects  there are still many important questions and problems to be addressed  including statistical issues. These statistical issues concern mainly multicollinearity in the SNP dataset  due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) among markers  which leads to unstable estimates in least-squares regression. Moreover  a major problem in the statistical models used to estimate SNP effects is that the number of variables that needs to be estimated () is much larger than the number of observations ()  thereby removing least squares from possible analysis methods. In the field of statistics  these problems are frequently overcome by using principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent regression on the principle components (PC) (PCR; principal component regression) instead of on the original variables. In general  PCA can be used to solve multicollinearity problems among predictor variables and to reduce the dimensional space. In genetic studies  PCA has been used mainly for population studies and has been a powerful tool to identify population structures and migration patterns  and to correct for stratification in association studies by capturing genetic variation []-[]. One of the first applications of PCA in population genetics was by Menozzi et al. [] to produce maps of human genetic variation across mainland regions. Likewise  in animal breeding  PCA has recently been used to infer population clusters from different breeds [] and to represent genotypes in the prediction of GEBV []-[]. Daetwyler et al. [] used PCA to investigate the impact of population structure on the accuracy of GEBV in a multi-breed sheep population. Results of these studies  which used either simulations or real data  describe PCA as a promising method for animal breeding to produce accurate GEBV. In these studies  the main benefits of using PCA were a significant reduction in data quantity (>90%) and fast computation. However  to date  there is only a limited number of studies based on real data that compare PCR for genomic prediction with a more commonly used genomic prediction model such as GBLUP (best linear unbiased prediction  in which the pedigree additive relationship matrix is replaced with a marker-derived relationship matrix) []. Since PCA is able to recover population structure  it may be expected that using this information is beneficial for genomic prediction applied to data with strong population structure. One such application is across-population genomic prediction  e.g. genomic prediction based on reference data that only includes data from other populations and not from the predicted population itself. Whether the ability of PCA to detect population structure is also beneficial in applications of across-population genomic prediction is currently unknown. The main objective of this research was to investigate the potential of PCR for across-population genomic prediction  as applied to yield traits in Holstein cows from different countries. More precisely  the objectives were (i) to compare the predictive accuracy of PCR with a REML model that uses a genomic relationship matrix (GREML) and (ii) to investigate the effect of alternative methods of extracting and selecting PC on the accuracy of genomic predictions. We used 66 116 daily records up to 45 weeks in lactation for milk  fat and protein yields from 1609 first lactation Holstein heifers. Heifers originated from four countries  Ireland (IRL; Teagasc  Moorepark Dairy Production)  United Kingdom (UK; Scottish Agricultural College)  the Netherlands (NLD; Wageningen UR Livestock Research) and Sweden (SWE; Swedish University of Agricultural Science). The UK data included animals from two divergent selection lines  a line selected for high fat and protein yield and a control line that represents the UK national average for fat and protein yield []. These two lines were therefore considered as two groups (UK_1 and UK_2). All phenotypes were pre-adjusted to account for the mean overall lactation curve  herd  diet group  milking frequency  year-month of milk test-day by management group  and experimental treatments. For a full description  see [] []. For each animal  a single pre-adjusted phenotype was obtained as the average daily milk  fat and protein yields for lactation weeks 3 to 15  derived from individually predicted lactation curves. Descriptive statistics of the pre-adjusted phenotypes are in Table . All animals were genotyped within the RobustMilk project () with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) containing 54 001 SNPs. Quality control checks on the SNPs used the following criteria: (1) a GenCall score greater than 0.20 and a GenTrain score greater than 0.55 for individual genotypes; (2) a call rate greater than 95%; (3) a minor allele frequency greater than 0.01 in each country; and (4) no extreme deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium ( < 600). After editing  37 069 SNPs remained across the 29 autosomes and the X-chromosome. The across-country dataset was split into five subsets and  in each analysis  four subsets were used as the reference set and the other one for testing. The first three test datasets included animals from only one country (Ireland  the Netherlands or Sweden)  while the last two each contained one of the UK selection lines  such that each animal had its genomic breeding value predicted once for each trait and model. The number of cows in each subset ranged from 181 to 618 (Table ). Accuracies of predicted genomic breeding values were calculated as Pearson correlations between the predicted genomic breeding values and the adjusted phenotypes within each test dataset (i.e. within country  and within line for the UK animals). Assume a matrix  of order    where  individuals have been genotyped for  SNPs. The elements of this matrix may be 0  1 or 2  representing the genotype of each individual for each SNP (0 and 2 for homozygotes and 1 for heterozygotes). The main idea of PCA is to reveal hidden structure in the data  to reduce the number of variables in the dataset  and to solve the multicollinearity problem (high correlation between columns in ). It extracts the most important information  in terms of variation  and re-expresses the original dataset in a simplified way. Thus  PCA aims at finding a small set  of PC that explain as much of the variability in  as possible. This is achieved through an orthogonal transformation of the original dataset such that as much of the original variability as possible is included in the first few PC. So  PC are linear combinations of a set of random variables in   i.e. the matrix  with PC is obtained by: where  represents the eigenvectors derived from spectral decomposition of the covariance (or correlation) matrix of . In genomic data  the covariance (correlation matrix) of the SNP genotypes (of order ) can be used or alternatively the similarity matrix of the individuals ( matrix  of order ). The first PC is then defined as the vector: which captures the maximum variance in   with the constraint that ' = 1. For all PC combinations  it holds that: (   = 0) for all  The basis of PCA is either the spectral decomposition of the covariance (correlation) matrix of  or the singular value decomposition (SVD) of . The SVD represents a more general view of the eigenvalue decomposition for non-square matrices . In general  PCA based on SVD and eigen decomposition are expected to yield similar results if  is square and symmetric []. Moreover  SVD on an    matrix  is expected to yield the same results as on its    correlation matrix. The concept of PCR  i.e. the use of PC in regression has been around for quite some time in the field of statistics [] []. For application in genomic prediction  first consider the general model to predict breeding values based on marker genotypes: where values in  are iid  is a vector of phenotypic records   is a vector of ones   is the overall mean   is a matrix (centred and possibly scaled) containing SNP genotypes   is a vector of additive effects of all SNPs   is a vector of residual effects   is the identity matrix and  is the residual variance. The initial step for a PCR model is to perform PCA on the genotype matrix   For this purpose  we used SVD via the function “prcomp” in R []  which works as follows. Consider the SVD of    = '  where  and  are the left and right singular vectors of   ' is the transpose of  and  is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values. The matrix  () of PC scores is then calculated as: where   where  is the rank of   and   is the loading matrix derived from the SVD of   which defines weights to the original  variables in each PC. Principal component analysis was initially performed only on the SNP matrix of the reference dataset  where the  matrix of PC was calculated as   where r denotes the reference dataset. The  matrix that was extracted from the reference dataset was also used to construct the  matrix for the test dataset as   where  contains the genotypes of the test dataset. Following from the above  the PCR model that was applied is: where  is the matrix of PC  and  is a vector with regression coefficients for each PC in . In this case  the derived transformed SNP effects (i.e. the values in  are treated as fixed effects in contrast to what is commonly used in genomic prediction models that perform simultaneous regression on SNP genotypes treating SNP effects as random []. In a second approach  PCA was performed on the matrix with all SNP genotypes  where genotypes of all reference and test datasets were included. For application in the PCR model  the  matrix was split in parts relating to the reference and test datasets ( and   respectively)  using methods that are briefly described in Additional file : Figure S1. In this approach  hereinafter referred to as semi-supervised PCR (SSPCR)  the genotypic information of the individuals to be predicted is partly included in the training dataset of the prediction model. This is because the axes of variation  i.e. the singular vectors and the singular values of the SVD were extracted using all genomic information available in the dataset. This concept of semi-supervised PCA was borrowed from computer science and face recognition analysis [] []. Two methods were tested to select sets of PC to be used in the subsequent PCR models. In the first method  PC were ranked based on decreasing eigenvalues (variation in the explanatory variables  i.e. the genotypes)  which will be referred to as PCR_eigen. In the second method  the PC were ranked based on their contribution to the sum of squares (ss) of the regression (variation in the response variable)  referred to as PCR_ss. These contributions were obtained from a PCR model for which only phenotypes and genotypes of the animals of the reference dataset were included. Once the order in which the PC should be added to the model is established  the question is how many PC should be used in the subsequent PCR model used for genomic prediction. There is no general consensus on which strategy should be followed for this. Inspecting plots of eigenvalues (via the so-called “scree plots” that plot the PC ranked based on decreasing eigenvalues) or keeping the number of PC that capture a given percentage of the original variation are two among a variety of methods (see [] for a detailed review). In our analyses  a cross-validation (CV) approach within the reference dataset (as in []) was chosen in order to obtain the “optimum” number of PC to include in the PCR  which will be further used in the section on prediction of the test dataset. For CV  the reference dataset was either split by country (and line in the case of UK)  which will be referred to as stratified CV hereafter  or split randomly in a 5-fold CV. In both these CV approaches  all PC were added in the PCR model one by one and the minimum mean squared error (MSE) of the predictions within the reference dataset was used as the target function to be optimized  which is briefly described in Additional file : Figure S2. Both CV approaches were performed using the R package “plsdof” []  with the appropriate modification for the semi-supervised PCA. For the GREML model  the following individual animal model with a genomic relationship matrix was fitted in ASReml-R []: where  is a vector of additive genetic effects for any of the considered traits and  is the design matrix that links  to the phenotypic records in . For additive genetic and residual effects  the following normal distributions were assumed:  and  Note that this is a genomic BLUP model but with estimation of variances  and  together with estimation of the breeding values using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Therefore  this model is more appropriately referred to as genomic REML (GREML) []. The genomic relationship matrix was calculated following VanRaden [] as: where  is the frequency at SNP  for which the homozygous genotype is coded 2  calculated across all genotyped animals  and  is derived from genotypes of animals in the reference dataset by subtracting 2 from a matrix  that specifies the marker genotypes for each individual as 0  1 or 2. Following Yang et al. []   was regressed back towards  (the pedigree relationship matrix) to account for errors in the estimation of   resulting in the computation of the genomic relationship matrix  as: where  is estimated according to Yang et al. []. The value of  ranged from 0.975 to 0.997 across different bins of pedigree-based relationships. So  although in theory this adjustment of  improves the properties of the  matrix []  in our case the adjusted  matrix was very close to the original matrix and is therefore expected to yield very similar predictions. PCA was performed on all SNP genotypes to investigate differences in genotypes between the Holstein populations included in this study. Based on the plot of the 1st against the 2nd PC (Figure )  one of the selection lines of the UK population could be distinguished from the rest with the first PC. However  it should be noted that the 1st and 2nd PC captured only 1.5% and 1.4% of the total original variability of the SNP data  respectively (Table ). Comparison of relationships based either on pedigree or genomic relationships also confirmed that the UK_1 population had the weakest average relationship with the other populations (Table ). In nearly all cases  standard deviations of the genomic relationships were higher than those of pedigree-based relationships  which indicates that the use of SNP information explains more variation in relationships than pedigree information. Averages and standard deviations of relationships were always higher within populations than between populations. This confirms that relationships among the five populations were low and that genomic predictions in these data indeed were “across populations”  in the sense that the reference data always included data only from other populations and not from the predicted population itself.  Principal component analysis performed on the whole dataset  with data from Ireland (IRL)  the Netherlands (NLD)  Sweden (SWE) and two divergent selection lines from United Kingdom (UK_1 and UK_2). Accuracies of genomic predictions obtained using GREML  PCR and SSPCR models  after determining the optimal number of PC based on the reference data  are in Table . On average  across test datasets and traits  GREML outperformed the PCR and SSPCR models. Across the test datasets  the performance of the PCR and SSPCR models was closest to that of GREML for milk with PCR_eigen and 5-fold CV (0.15 vs. 0.14)  and for fat with SSPCR_ss and 5-fold CV (0.07 for both models). For protein  the maximum accuracy obtained with PCR and SSPCR was 0.02 achieved in four cases (PCR_eigen and 5-fold CV  PCR_ss and stratified CV  SSPCR_ss and 5-fold CV  and SSPCR_ss and stratified CV) versus 0.05 for GREML. Accuracies of genomic prediction differed between the PCR and SSPCR models and also based on the two CV approaches that were used to obtain the optimum PCR (or SSPCR) model (Table ). Interestingly  in some cases the stratified CV resulted in a null model  i.e. a model where only the intercept was included. In such cases  all predicted individuals had the same GEBV which was the mean of the reference dataset. This occurred only when predicting UK_1 and was independent of the method used (PCR or SSPCR)  the approach of sorting the PC (eigen vs. ss)  and trait. A closer look on the number of PC used in the various PCR and SSPCR models and in the CV methods (Table ) showed that  in general  a stratified approach reduced the number of PC but also resulted in lower accuracy  on average  compared to using 5-fold random CV. Moreover  for all except the UK_1 fat predictions  SSPCR_eigen used fewer PC than PCR_eigen. In contrast  quite a large number of PC was included in the SSPCR_ss models for all traits and both CV approaches. In the present study  a CV approach was used to select the PCR (or SSPCR) model that was used for genomic prediction. An additional objective was to investigate the full potential of PCR (or SSPCR) and the ability of CV to achieve this. To investigate this  the pattern of the accuracies when adding PC one by one in the model  was evaluated to identify the model with the highest accuracy (“best case scenario”). It should be noted that this is not possible in practical genomic prediction applications  because it involves the use of phenotypic information of the test dataset. Those best case scenarios PCR (or SSPCR) models always outperformed GREML (Table ) and the optimal PCR and SSPCR models based on cross-validation (Table ). For the common PCR case  where PCA was applied on the genotypic data from the reference dataset  the pattern of accuracies was evaluated for an increasing number of PC that were included in the model based on decreasing eigenvalues (Figure ). Several interesting observations can be made from these results. The PCR_eigen method generally resulted in higher accuracies than the PCR_ss method (Figure ; Table ). Accuracies using PCR_ss were slightly higher in only three cases. The pattern of the accuracies  when an increasing number of PC was included in the models  differed between traits and populations. In many cases  using very few PC (usually less than 50) gave accuracies very close to the maximum obtained across the whole range of number of PC included (Figure ).  PCA was performed in the reference dataset. Selection of PC was based on eigenvalues (left panel) or on the sum of square contributions (right panel). Traits analysed were average daily milk  fat and protein yields for test populations from Ireland (IRL)  the Netherlands (NLD)  Sweden (SWE) and two divergent selection lines from United Kingdom (UK_1 and UK_2). For this model  the whole SNP dataset  i.e. both the reference and testing data  was included in the PCA  while only phenotypes of the reference subset were used to estimate the regression coefficients in PCR. In this approach  genomic information on the test dataset  such as LD  is incorporated in the weights on the SNPs applied in each eigenvector. In some cases  this SSPCR_eigen method resulted in a slight increase in accuracies and in a reduction in the number of PC needed to achieve the highest accuracies compared to PCR_eigen (Table   Figure ). Interestingly  for the UK_1 population  accuracies of 0.45  0.18 and 0.28 for milk  fat and protein yields were obtained with only the first six  one and seven PC  respectively. On average  SSPCR resulted in slightly higher accuracies than PCR when the genotypes of the test dataset were excluded from the PCA step.  PCA was performed on the whole dataset. Selection of PC was based on eigenvalues (left panel) or on the sum of square contributions (right panel). Traits analysed were average daily milk  fat and protein yields for test populations from Ireland (IRL)  the Netherlands (NLD)  Sweden (SWE) and two divergent selection lines from United Kingdom (UK_1 and UK_2). Principal component regression enables data reduction in the regression model and solves problems of dependencies among variables (multicollinearity). The main advantage of PCR derives from the ability of PCA to capture a large proportion of the original variability of the dataset (e.g. >90%) in a small set of uncorrelated PC. As a result  generally a limited number of PC can replace the original variables with little loss of information. Based on this  we tested whether PCA and its regression (PCR) can provide a useful alternative method for genomic prediction. Our results showed that  on average  PCR yielded lower accuracies than the more commonly used GREML model  although it has the potential to yield considerably higher prediction accuracies than the GREML model. It should be noted that this potential was realized in the “best case scenario” that used both genotypic and phenotypic information from the test dataset animals to derive the optimal number of PC included in the model  which is not possible in practice. Nevertheless  the results of this scenario can be regarded as an upper limit of the achievable prediction accuracy  provided that the most appropriate PC can be selected in a practical application. Optimization (i.e. selection of PC) using the reference data by two different CV approaches (stratified vs. 5-fold random)  proved to be unable to capitalize on the full potential of PCR  but still achieved levels of prediction accuracy close to those obtained with GREML. Although prediction accuracies appeared to be quite low for all models  it should be noted that the reported accuracies are Pearson correlations between observed phenotypes and predicted GEBV. Transforming those values to the accuracy of GEBV  which is defined as the correlation between true and predicted GEBV  involves division by the square root of the heritability of the trait. Since  for instance  the heritabilities of the adjusted phenotypes for milk yield used in our study ranged from 0.13 to 0.59 (results not shown) across countries  accuracies of GEBV for milk yield are predicted to be 1.3 to 2.8 times higher than the reported correlations. Genomic relationships between reference and test datasets have been shown to have an important effect on prediction accuracy [] []. The average squared relationship between reference and test datasets has been shown to be a better predictor of accuracy of genomic prediction than the average relationship between reference and test datasets []. Since the variance of relationships is closely related to the average squared relationship  we compared the standard deviation of relationships and the average relationships between populations (Table ). The on average low relationships between the populations in our data and  in particular  the lower variance of relationships between populations compared to within populations  predicted that accuracies of genomic predictions would be low  which was indeed the case. Although we focussed on commonly measured milk yield traits  our results can be extended to other traits such as feed intake  for which  pooling existing research herd data is the only option to enable genomic prediction []. In fact  pooling of such data has become possible by using genotypes  because models based on genomic relationships can overcome issues caused by low connectedness based on pedigree []. An important question is how to select the optimal set of PC for the PCR model  using information from the reference data  such that the accuracy achieved is at least similar to the accuracy achieved with GREML. We used CV on the reference data to optimize the order and number of included PC. As a first observation  the “best” PCR model  i.e. the model obtained in the “best case scenario”  was never proposed with the CV approach. In our analyses  optimization of the CV was based on minimising the MSE. However  since the accuracy of EBV is important for animal breeding and affects response to selection  an alternative scenario could be to select the “best” PCR model after CV in the reference data based on maximum accuracy instead of minimum MSE. The main advantage of PCR was that it reduced the dimension of the data by at least 96%. Despite the generally high reduction in data dimension  the highest accuracies after CV were achieved for a wide range of numbers of PC included in the PCR model  from only one to more than 1000 (Tables  and ). This is a wider range than that reported in previous studies based on simulated data  in which the highest accuracies were achieved when the number of PC ranged from 250 to 350 [] []. However  it should be noted that for PCR_eigen  which is the most commonly used approach in the literature  the number of PC in the model was between 28 and 249 after CV and between 1 and 1112 for the “best case scenario”. By adding PC one by one in the model  it was shown that most PC affected the accuracy of predictions either positively or negatively and thus the trajectory of the accuracies was not stable but fluctuated (Figures  and ). Moreover  in some cases the first few PC resulted in the highest accuracies. As a result  using empirical thresholds to select PC for inclusion in the model (e.g. PC that together explain more than 90% of the original variability in the SNP genotypes based on eigenvalues) simply does not result in the highest accuracies that can be achieved in PCR. Thus  the number and selection of PC for inclusion in the PCR model should be derived empirically for each dataset. The semi-supervised PCR model also used genotypic information from the test dataset. Despite our expectation that this would improve accuracy of predictions  because the model would be forced to define PC that explain variation in the genotypes of the test dataset  this model on average performed less well than the PCR model (Table ). However  for the best case scenario  when accuracies were evaluated across different numbers of PC based on the phenotypes of the test dataset  the semi-supervised approach did yield slightly higher accuracies than the PCR model (Table ). This indicates that the semi-supervised PCR has the potential to perform at least equally well as PCR  although it appears that identifying the optimal set of PC for the semi-supervised PCR model is even more difficult than for the PCR model. In the context of genomic prediction  the semi-supervised PCR may be more relevant when large differences exist between the genotypes of the reference and the test datasets. The most obvious application is across-breed or -line genomic prediction  where one breed or line is used to predict another. In that case  the semi-supervised PCR model may be able to better target the variance of the predicted line or breed. It should be noted that including animals of the predicted breed in the reference data  e.g. [] []  may yield a similar result  regardless of the model used. In other studies that used PCA for genomic prediction []-[]  the PC used only accounted for the variability captured in the original matrix  (SNPs) and not for the proportion of explained phenotypic variance in the reference population (as used here with PCR_ss in the common and semi-supervised approaches). However  it has been shown in statistical literature that the first principal components (accounting for most variation in ) can totally fail as predictors in PCR (in terms of accounting for variation in the response variable) and that even components that explain little variance in  can be important for prediction [] []-[]. For instance  using Hald’s data  Hadi and Ling [] showed that while the first three (out of four) PC accounted for 99.96% of the variability in   they contributed nothing (zero sum of squares) to the fit of the regression model; instead  the last PC alone contributed everything. Thus  these authors proposed that the selection of PC should be based not only on the variance decomposition of the co-variables but also on the contribution of each PC to the regression sum of squares. However  despite the expectation that PCR_ss would yield at least equally accurate estimates as PCR_eigen  we observed the opposite in our analyses. It should be noted that PCR_ss selected PC based on associations with phenotype in the reference data. In that regard  PCR_ss is very similar to partial least squares regression [] []. Thus  our results suggest that the PC that show the strongest associations with phenotypes in the reference data do not necessarily have the strongest associations with the phenotypes in the testing data. By investigating the pattern of the accuracies of the PCR models (Figures  and )  we observed that some specific combinations of PC resulted in relatively high prediction accuracies  considering the limited size of the reference dataset  and also compared to GREML. In our analyses  the highest accuracies from the PCR models across the numbers of PC included outperformed those from the GREML models in all cases. The data reduction achieved by PCR solves the “small  large ” issue and thereby enables the use of fixed regression  as done in our study  rather than the random regressions commonly used in genomic prediction models. An important question is why PCR_eigen and SSPCR_eigen in the “best case scenario” achieved a higher accuracy than GREML  while it uses a linear transformation of the SNP data used in GREML. The most likely explanation is the fact that by using fixed regression  the model is able to put as much or as little emphasis on any PC  without shrinking the effects  following the associations with phenotypic data. Other genomic prediction models such as GREML assume equal contributions of each SNP to the total variability  and generally include shrinkage of effects of individual SNP effects by modelling them as random effects. Although the variance explained by SNPs in a shrinkage model can still depart substantially from the prior assumptions based on evidence from the data  especially if the reference population is large []  estimated effects will still be affected by those prior assumptions. In this respect  PCR can be regarded as a variable selection method  albeit at the level of PC rather than individual SNPs. This implies that the accuracies reported for the “best case scenarios” provide an upper limit for the accuracy that could be achieved with variable selection models applied to PC rather than to SNPs. One of the underlying assumptions of PCA is linearity  such that the feature space is a linear transformation of the original data. In order to overcome the problem of linearity  Schölkopf et al. [] considered nonlinear component analysis as a “kernel eigenvalue problem” and introduced the term “kernel PCA”. The use of kernels has already been introduced in genomic prediction models []. In addition  since Bayesian models are often used in genomic prediction  the use of probabilistic PCA []  where maximum likelihood is used to extract PC  could also be proposed for future research in genomic prediction. Concerning the selection of SNPs the target function in our study was to minimize the prediction MSE. As suggested above  an alternative could be to select PC in the CV procedure based on maximum prediction accuracy. In addition  more sophisticated techniques such as the combination of statistical methods like PCA  neural networks and genetic algorithms could be applied  as has already been tested in other fields []. However  a balance between benefits (e.g. higher prediction accuracies) and costs (e.g. computation time) should be taken into account. In general  PCA and multivariate analysis techniques have proven to be useful tools to extract information from markers. In addition  as an exploratory method  analyses with PCA can be performed without strong assumptions on the data (e.g. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  LD) []. A disadvantage of PCA is that it does not take the response variable into account. However  in our study  this did not affect accuracies negatively (comparing PCR_eigen and PCR_ss in the common and semi-supervised approach). Nevertheless  it remains necessary to be very careful when applying multivariate analysis to genomic data  especially when interpreting the results. Jombart et al. [] provided a nice overview of a multivariate analysis application with genetic data and examined the incorrect use of multivariate analysis in different genetic datasets  as well as fallacies when interpreting the results. For instance  one assumption of PCA is that PC with large eigenvalues represent structure in the data  while those with low eigenvalues capture noise. This might not always be true and PC with small eigenvalues could contain predictive information  or perhaps reflect genotypes at a single SNP. Thus  PC should not be excluded from the analysis on the basis of their small contribution to the total variance in SNP genotypes. Our results confirmed that the optimum number of PC to be included in the PCR model can vary considerably across datasets and traits. Our results show that PCR results in genomic prediction accuracies that are generally slightly lower than those obtained with a GREML model. In general  selecting PC based on their eigenvalues resulted in higher accuracies than selecting PC on decreasing correlations to the response variable in the reference dataset. Inclusion of genotypic information of the test animals when extracting the PC  i.e. the semi-supervised approach  unexpectedly decreased the accuracy when PC were selected based on the reference dataset after cross-validation. The semi-supervised approach did  however  slightly increase the potential of the model  i.e. the highest accuracies that can be achieved  provided that it is possible to select the optimal set of included PC. While the pattern of prediction accuracies across included PC showed that PCR had a higher potential than GREML  the model that was selected by CV within the reference data could not capitalize on this potential. On average  5-fold random CV for PCR outperformed stratified CV. However  to capitalize on the full potential of PCR in practical applications  it is still unclear what the best way to select PC to be included in the model is.

In this study  an intercross population was constructed between the indigenous Chinese Minzhu pig breed and the western commercial Large White pig breed to examine the genetic basis for variation in limb bone length. The aim of this study was to detect potential genetic variants associated with porcine limb bone length.MethodsA total of 571 F2 individuals from a Large White and Minzhu intercross population were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60K Beadchip  and phenotyped for femur length (FL)  humerus length (HL)  hipbone length (HIPL)  scapula length (SL)  tibia length (TL)  and ulna length (UL).

In this study  an intercross population was constructed between the indigenous Chinese Minzhu pig breed and the western commercial Large White pig breed to examine the genetic basis for variation in limb bone length. The aim of this study was to detect potential genetic variants associated with porcine limb bone length. A total of 571 F2 individuals from a Large White and Minzhu intercross population were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60K Beadchip  and phenotyped for femur length (FL)  humerus length (HL)  hipbone length (HIPL)  scapula length (SL)  tibia length (TL)  and ulna length (UL). A genome-wide association study was performed by applying the previously reported approach of genome-wide rapid association using mixed model and regression. Statistical significance of the associations was based on Bonferroni-corrected -values. A total of 39 significant SNPs were mapped to a 11.93 Mb long region on pig chromosome 7 (SSC7). Linkage analysis of these significant SNPs revealed three haplotype blocks of 495 kb  376 kb and 492 kb  respectively  in the 11.93 Mb region. Annotation based on the pig reference genome identified 15 genes that were located near or contained the significant SNPs in these linkage disequilibrium intervals. Conditioned analysis revealed that four SNPs  one on SSC2 and three on SSC4  showed significant associations with SL and HL  respectively. Analysis of the 15 annotated genes that were identified in these three haplotype blocks indicated that  and  which are expressed in limbs and influence chondrocyte cell growth and differentiation  could be considered as relevant biological candidates for limb bone length in pig  with potential applications in breeding programs. Our results may also be useful for the study of the mechanisms that underlie human limb length and body height. In humans and other mammalian species  individuals with greater limb length have greater body height. In humans  limb bone length is highly correlated with body height  with correlation coefficients reaching 0.60 to 0.88 []-[]. Thus  analysis of genetic variants associated with limb bone length can contribute to our understanding of human height. The ease with which experimental designs can be conducted in domestic pig makes this species an important large animal model for human research as well as a major farm animal for meat production []. In pigs  limb length influences body height and thus  ham yield  to a great extent []. Porcine cured ham  such as Jinhua ham and Iberian ham  is one of the most popular and valuable meat products worldwide. However  in China  ham products are produced from indigenous pig breeds  most of which have smaller limb lengths than western commercial pig breeds such as Large White  Landrace  and Duroc []. Thus  understanding the genetic basis of the variation in limb length between the two types of pig breeds is of economic importance. Based on the high-density panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been developed to identify DNA variants associated with many complex diseases and traits in humans and animals [] []. Although quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect limb bone length have been detected on pig chromosomes (SSC for ) SSC1  2  3  4  5  7  14  15  16  17 and X [] []  to date  no GWAS has been carried out for this trait. The aim of this study was to detect potential genetic variants associated with limb bone length in a Large White × Minzhu intercross population using a GWAS and to identify candidate genes that are near these polymorphisms or that include them with major effects on this trait. All animals used in this study were treated according to the guidelines for experimental animals established by the Council of China. Animal experiments were approved by the Science Research Department of the Institute of Animal Science  Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Beijing  China). An intercross population was developed between a western commercial pig breed (long-limbed Large White) and a Chinese indigenous pig breed (short-limbed Minzhu)  as described previously []. A total of 571 F2 animals (53 litters) were obtained from 36 F1 dams  which were mated to nine sires. All F2 piglets were weaned at 35 days of age and male pigs were castrated three days after birth. All F2 animals were slaughtered at 240 ± 7 days in 30 batches (slaughter groups). After slaughter  both the forelimb and hind limb were removed from the left side of the carcass of the F2 animals. Six limb bones were dissected from these limbs and their lengths were measured using a caliper according to Mao et al. []. These included the femur (total length from the greater trochanter to the intercondyloid fossa)  humerus (total length from the head to the trochlea)  hipbone (length from the crista iliaca to the ramus inferior ossis pubis)  scapula (the maximum straight line distance from the cavitas glenoidalis to the border of the scapular cartilage)  tibia (length from the intercondylar eminence to the medial malleolus)  and ulna (length from the olecranon process to the styloid process). A normal distribution test was applied for each trait using the univariate normal procedure in SAS software. A total of 455 blood samples and 116 ear tissue samples were used for genomic DNA extraction using the salting-out method []. Genotyping was performed using Illumina PorcineSNP60 Genotyping BeadChip technology  which contained 62 163 SNPs across the whole genome. Quality control procedures were performed for the F2 individuals using the GenABEL package [] within the R statistical environment. Quality control filtering of SNPs was done as follows: SNPs that had a call rate below 90%  or a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 3%  or that were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with a -value below 10 were eliminated. The final dataset that passed the quality control procedure and was used in the analysis contained 48 238 SNPs and 564 F2 individuals. The GWAS was performed by applying the genome-wide rapid association approach using mixed model and regression [] []  according to []. Sex  parity  and batch were selected as fixed effects for individuals and the litter effect was considered as a random effect. The DMU [] and GenABEL software packages [] in the R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing were used to analyze the data. A genome-wide significance threshold of 2.07E-08 (0.001/48238) was determined by the Bonferroni method  in which the conventional -value was divided by the number of tests performed []. The most significant SNP was considered as a fixed effect and conditioned analysis was performed according to the GWAS procedure described above. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed on the region that contained all SNPs that were significantly associated with limb bone length. The Haploview v4.1 program [] was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium measures and to visualize haplotype blocks. Descriptive statistics including means  standard deviations  minimum and maximum lengths of limb bones of the F2 individuals are in Table . Mean values for femur length (FL)  humerus length (HL)  hipbone length (HIPL)  scapula length (SL)  tibia length (TL)  and ulna length (UL) were equal to 21.64 cm  18.72 cm  25.46 cm  17.37 cm  19.38 cm  and 21.04 cm  respectively. The normal distribution test showed that not all traits followed a normal distribution. However  residuals  which were estimated in step 1 of the GWAS protocol as described previously []  followed a normal distribution and were used as the dependent trait to test the associations using a single locus regression analysis (data not shown). The correlation coefficients between the traits are in Table . All correlations were highly significant ( < 0.0001) and positive  and the coefficients ranged from 0.6211 to 0.7846. After quality control  48 238 SNPs and 564 F2 individuals were used for the GWAS. The selected SNPs were distributed over 18 autosomes and the X/Y chromosomes  as shown in [See Additional file : Table S1]. A threshold of 2.07E-08 (0.001/48238) was used in this study. Six traits were assessed; the resulting Manhattan plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots are in Figures  and   respectively. The Q-Q plot results showed an obvious deviation between the real and expected data and indicated that the association detected on pig chromosome SSC7 (SSC ) is statistically significant.  Chromosomes 1-18  X and Y are shown in different colors. The red horizontal line indicates the genome-wide significance level (-log (2.07E-08)).  Results are shown in black. SNPs for which the test statistic exceeds 25 are represented by triangles. A total of 39 genome-wide significant SNPs were located in a 11.93 Mb (Megabase) long region of the long arm of SSC7 (i.e. SSC7q) between 31.24 and 43.17 Mb. Of the 39 SNPs  29  35  12  6  39  and 27 were significantly associated with FL  HL  HIPL  SL  TL  and UL  respectively [See Additional file : Table S2]. All significant SNPs were used for BLAST searches on the pig genome database (Build 10.2) and 14 of the SNPs were located within 13 annotated genes. All other SNPs were between 4327 and 137 056 bp away from the nearest known genes. The most significant SNP for each trait was MARC0033464  which accounted for 47.93%  57.89%  52.28%  37.50%  51.97%  and 57.80% of the phenotypic variance for FL  HL  HIPL  SL  TL  and UL  respectively. In addition  11 chromosome-wide significant ( < 6.16E-05) SNPs were identified in the distal region of SSC7q [See Additional file : Table S3]. A conditioned analysis was performed using the most significant SNP  MARC0033464  as a fixed effect. The Manhattan and Q-Q plots obtained from the conditioned analysis are in [See Additional file : Figure S1 and Additional file : Figure S2]  respectively. No significant SNP was detected on SSC7 after the conditioned analysis. However  four SNPs  one on SSC2 and three on SSC4  showed chromosome-wide associations with SL and HL  respectively [See Additional file : Table S4]. Linkage analysis of the 11.93 Mb region identified three haplotype blocks that ranged in size from 376 kb to 495 kb (Figure ). Block1 495 kb long (between H3GA0020765 and ASGA0032526) and block2 376 kb long (between H3GA0020824 and ASGA0032571) were both in complete LD (r = 1). Block1 contained the most significant SNP  MARC0033464  and six annotated genes  namely   ();  ();  ();  ();  (); and  (). Block2 contained five annotated genes  namely   ()   ()   ()   ()  and  (). Block 3 492 kb long (between H3GA0020849 and ASGA0032595) contained four annotated genes  namely   ();  ();  (); and  ().  Solid lines mark the three identified blocks. Block1 495 kb long that contains the most significant SNP i.e. MARC0033464 was in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD  r = 1). We performed a GWAS for six porcine limb bone lengths and identified significant SNPs on the long arm of SSC7 between 31.24 and 43.17 Mb. A single QTL can influence multiple traits []. All significant SNPs were clustered in the same region  and the high correlation (0.62 to 0.78) among the six traits suggested that a QTL with a pleiotropic effect on limb bone lengths was located in the 11.93 Mb region identified on SSC7q. To our knowledge  this is the first time that a genome-wide association of SNPs with HIPL is reported in pigs. These SNPs  which were also associated with the five other traits (FL  HL  SL  TL  and UL)  were located within known QTL regions. Previously  a 108.89 Mb region (between 12.19 and 121.08 Mb) on SSC7 was reported to harbor a QTL that influenced limb bone length []. Our results narrow down this region to 11.93 Mb. The additional significant SNPs found at the distal end of the SSC7q may result from the large linkage disequilibrium that exists in the F2 design population []. Although the GWAS based on an F2 population design effectively narrowed down the QTL region  the large linkage disequilibrium present in this population is a limitation that can result in a larger linkage region than that observed using natural populations in livestock [] or humans []. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed using all 233 chromosome-wide significant SNPs. The fact that the SNPs at the distal end of SSC7q and other significant SNPs were not in LD [See Additional file : Figure S3] indicates that there was no obvious error in the genome assembly and the second peak in this region might be caused by a second QTL. To overcome the above limitation  post-GWAS analysis often includes haplotype analysis  which is a reliable method to identify the minimum segment that contains the causal gene []. Three haplotype blocks  respectively 376 kb  492 kb  and 495 kb long  were detected. Fifteen annotated genes were near or contained the significant SNPs of these three haplotype blocks. According to the mouse gene expression data in MGI ()  the genes            and  are expressed in mouse limbs. However          and  are  respectively  involved in the regulation of neural stem cell differentiation []  mediation of mammary luminal epithelial lineage-specific gene expression []  association with diamond-Blackfan anemia []  regulation of early lung cancer angiogenesis and metastatic progression []  and regulation of the immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells []. None of these genes have been reported to be associated with bone growth and  thus  cannot be considered as good candidates for limb bone length. The remaining genes   and  are involved in chondrocyte cell growth and differentiation. HMGA1 is ubiquitous in all cells of higher eukaryotes [] and is known to have a biological role in cell growth and differentiation []. Silencing  expression in invasive  aggressive cancer cells dramatically arrests cell growth and blocks their oncogenic properties  including proliferation  migration  invasion  and orthotopic tumorigenesis []. It was also shown that in vitro culture of porcine chondrocytes in the presence of HMGA1 increased their proliferation  which suggests that it could be a promising approach to enhance cartilage tissue repair and growth []. Furthermore   influences the expression of  () and thus acts as a modulator of  () activity []  a gene which has been reported to be involved in bone growth  tibia length  body height  and body size in both humans and animals []-[]. In addition  human GWAS have suggested that  may be a good candidate for anthropometric traits. In Western European populations  GWAS revealed that SNP rs6918981 that is located near the  gene contributed to height variation ( < 10) []. Moreover  another SNP (rs1776897) located within the  gene has been reported to have genome-wide associations with human height ( = 1.6E-08) and hip axis length ( = 0.005) []. Regarding the  gene  Duan et al. [] reported that its activation can inhibit chondrocyte differentiation and growth in pigs. Several reports have identified a  variant associated with limb bone length  which indicates that it could be a good candidate for human height. A GWAS that included 183 727 individuals showed that the  gene was associated with human height []. Another GWAS study on individuals of African ancestry showed that an SNP (rs9470004) that is located in  was associated with adult height ( = 1.0E-11) []. Therefore  both  and  can be considered as good candidates for limb bone length and should be studied further. As for the human studies described above  our GWAS on a pig population revealed that the  and  genes displayed significant association with porcine limb bone length. These results confirm that pig is an appropriate large animal model for human height and limb length research. We conclude that  and  are relevant biological candidates for limb bone length in pigs. Further analyses of these genes based on additional genetic  functional  and computational studies are expected to provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms responsible for limb bone length in different pig breeds and also perhaps for human height.

Using a single-step approach with GBLUP  prediction accuracy of candidates was greater than that based on parent average of official evaluations and accuracies obtained with a two-step approach. Except for regression coefficients of DYD on GEBV  there were no significant differences between the three models. With the recent availability of the Illumina goat SNP50 BeadChip []  it has become possible to study the implementation of genomic selection in French dairy goat. In this species  as in dairy cattle  genomic selection has the ability to shorten the generation interval for the sire-son pathway (5.5 years with progeny-testing []) by selecting males shortly after birth. The utility of genomic selection is dictated by the accuracy of the genomic breeding values (GEBV) of the selection candidates  which has to be greater than the parent average accuracy for genomic () selection to be effective. However  although the French population of genotyped goats is the largest worldwide  it only counts around 900 males of the Alpine and Saanen breeds. Analysis of the genetic structure of this population []  based on estimates of linkage disequilibrium and inbreeding and kinship coefficients  showed a high level of genetic diversity. The number of effective founders was estimated to be equal to 191 and 124 for the Alpine and Saanen breeds  respectively  based on females born between 2010 and 2011 []. Considering the relatively small sample size and the genetic structure of this population  the prediction accuracy of GEBV is not expected to be as high in these populations as in dairy cattle []. Within the French dairy goat breeding scheme  bucks used for breeding have more than 2000 daughters at the end of their productive life. Females used as buck dams have at least three lactations. This yields accurate parent estimated breeding values (EBV)  and consequently fairly high parent average accuracies of young selection candidates (0.63 on average for milk yield) []. A first study on genomic prediction in dairy goats [] used a two-step genomic approach. Step one consisted of deriving average daughter performance corrected for fixed and non-genetic random effects and for genetic effects of the dams (daughter yield deviations  DYD). Step two involved a genomic evaluation based on these DYD. These steps are especially essential for dairy traits on which males are selected and genotyped but for which they are not phenotyped []. This approach resulted in GEBV with accuracies as high as those of parent average EBV for young selection candidates that were not yet progeny-tested []. GEBV accuracies of candidates depend on the genetic characteristics of the reference population i.e. number of individuals  effective population size  linkage disequilibrium  inbreeding level  and relationship of candidates to the reference population and heritability of the phenotype []-[]. The structure of the reference population could not be optimized by either genotyping other males because all progeny-tested males were genotyped or by choosing in the reference population the highly related males because of its size. In this context  GEBV accuracy could only be improved by using the most suitable model for genomic evaluation. Several studies []-[] have shown that the single-step approach proposed by Legarra et al. [] provides greater accuracy than the two-step approach used in []. The single-step approach allows all recorded phenotypes to be used  without pre-adjustment for fixed effects  and to evaluate all animals  regardless of whether they have been genotyped or phenotyped []. Another approach  the pseudo-single-step approach [] can also deal with non-genotyped individuals by adding records of non-genotyped males in a two-step procedure. The pseudo-single-step approach is a two-step approach (i.e. based on DYD). However  it is an intermediate approach between the two-step and single-step approaches  because it includes information on all males with DYD  but ignores maternal information unlike the single-step approach []. Thus  it was expected that validation correlations using the pseudo-single-step approach would be intermediate to those obtained with the single-step and two-step approaches. Our goat population was composed of two breeds that were evaluated together in the previous study because of their small population sizes []. These breeds are managed together in 10% of the French dairy goat herds. The white coat Saanen breed is a selected variety of the Alpine breed that originated several centuries ago []. Currently  selection in French dairy goats is done within-breed for the Alpine and Saanen breeds based on within-breed genetic evaluations  except for milk production traits  for which a multi-breed model is used. Alpine and Saanen breeds have similar heritability and repeatability parameters for milk production and type traits but differ in genetic and residual variances []  persistence of linkage disequilibrium [] and allele frequencies. These differences raise doubts on the benefits of multi-breed genomic evaluation for this population. Few studies dealing with multi-breed evaluation in other species have compared their results to within-breed models []-[]. When several breeds are pooled in a single reference population  accuracies depend on the genetic characteristics and similarities between breeds. Recent research has not led to a consensus on the advantage of using multi-breed genomic evaluation. Very few studies have explored the use of relationships between breeds in multi-breed genomic evaluation [] [] using  for instance  multiple-trait models. Here  we tested a single-step approach using three models. The first model was a multi-breed model in which Alpine and Saanen populations were pooled together and considered as a single population (with only one set of genetic parameters). The second model was a multiple-trait model as described in Karoui et al. []  where a trait recorded in the Alpine breed was considered to be different from  but correlated with  the same trait recorded in the Saanen breed. In this case  genetic parameters were specific to each breed. The third model was a within-breed model  where one model was used for the Saanen population and another for the Alpine population  with different genetic parameters for each breed. The SNP genotypes obtained using DNA samples extracted from blood were performed according to the French National Guidelines for the care and use of animals for research purposes. Animal genotypes used in this study were the same as in Carillier et al. []. After a quality check (MAF > 1%  call rate > 98%) that was done separately for the two breeds  46 959 SNPs (out of 53 347 of the Illumina SNP50 BeadChip []) were validated. Missing SNP genotypes (0.1%) were not imputed but the GBLUP method used took missing data into account when estimating GEBV. From the 825 genotyped bucks (355 Saanen and 470 Alpine individuals) born between 1993 and 2011  148 (86 Alpine and 62 Saanen individuals born in 2010 and 2011) were not yet progeny-tested and could not be used for training. Five milk production traits that were derived from a total lactation were analyzed  i.e. milk yield (kg)  fat and protein yields (kg)  fat and protein contents (g/kg)  along with somatic cell score (SCS: log-transformed somatic cell counts)  and five udder type traits that were scored on a linear scale of 1 to 9  i.e. udder floor position  udder shape  rear udder attachment  fore udder and teat angle. Udder type traits were recorded once for each female. Repeatability was not modeled for the udder type traits. Data originated from the official genetic evaluation of January 2013  using only records on purebred Alpine and Saanen goats. For milk production traits  4 178 315 Alpine records (30.2% first lactations  24.2% second lactations and 45.6% third or more lactations) and 3 173 516 Saanen records (31.1% first lactations  24.5% second lactations and 44.4% third or more lactations) of females born between 1950 and 2012 were used. Recently  the number of records for SCS and type traits has been smaller than that for milk production traits. Weights for SCS and milk production records were as defined in the official genetic evaluation [] [] according to lactation number (from 1 to 10) and length of lactation (up to 180 days or not). The pedigree used in this study consisted of 2 981 809 animals (40% Saanen  53% Alpine  4% crossbred of Alpine and Saanen and 3% other breeds) born between 1950 and 2012 and considered up to 29 generations for males. It was completed by 43 unknown parent groups defined according to breed and birth year: one group every two years  with sires and dams pooled together. Animal GEBV were estimated using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) with the blup90iod program []   using models as described in the following. The first model used for multi-breed genomic prediction was: where  is the vector of all female records (<U+03BD>) from the two breeds weighted by their lactation weights as defined above  and  is the incidence matrix relating fixed effects () to individuals. The following fixed effects were considered for milk production traits and SCS: herd (within year and parity)  age and month at delivery (within year and region)  length of dry period (within year and region) and breed. For type traits  fixed effects were: herd (within year)  age at scoring  lactation stage and breed.  is the incidence matrix relating permanent environmental effects ()  which were normally distributed   to individuals   is a design matrix allocating observations to breeding values ()  and  is a vector of random normal errors  normally distributed . Genomic breeding values  were assumed normally distributed with   where  is the multi-breed genetic relationship matrix combining SNP marker information and pedigree data  implemented as in Legarra et al. []: where  is a sub-matrix of the pedigree-based relationship matrix () for ungenotyped animals   is a sub-matrix for genotyped animals  and  (or ) is a sub-matrix that describes the pedigree-based relationship between ungenotyped and genotyped animals. The genomic relationship matrix () was scaled to be comparable with the  matrix using the correction defined by Gao et al. []. Matrix  was derived as in []. where  is the number of SNPs  q the allele frequency of the whole population (Alpine and Saanen) for SNP j and  is a centered matrix of SNP genotypes. The within-breed model was similar to the above multi-breed model except that Alpine and Saanen were evaluated separately. The relationship matrices ( for Saanen breed and  for Alpine breed) were defined as in the previous model except that they were derived from the allele frequencies (q) observed in each breed. The same pedigree as defined above in the paragraph on data was used to derive the pedigree relationship matrix. The third model used in this study was the same as that used in []: where  and  is the vector of true breeding values normally distributed with . The fixed effects considered in this model  were the same as in the within-breed model. The vector of permanent environmental effects    was normally distributed with   where  and  are the values used in official evaluations (Table ). The genomic relationship matrix was built as in the multi-breed model and estimated with allele frequencies derived across breed. In this model   is the vector of random normal errors  defined as:  Three levels of genetic covariance between the traits for the Alpine and Saanen breeds () were used in this study: (1) the covariance estimated from the data (see the section on \"Genetic parameter estimation\" below)  (2) the covariance such that the genetic correlation (<U+03C1>) was equal to 0  which leads to a model that is similar to the within-breed model  and (3) the covariance such that the genetic correlation was equal to 0.99  which results in a model that is close to the multi-breed model. The genetic parameters used in the multi-breed model were those used in official genetic evaluations (Table ). For the multiple-trait and within-breed models  genetic parameters were estimated from the data (Table )  except for repeatabilities  which were those in Table  and considered similar for both breeds. Genetic and residual variances      and  and the genetic covariance were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with remlf90 software []  using a multiple-trait model (see above) and the multi-breed  matrix described earlier. Standard deviations of heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated using the approximation of Klei []  using airemlf90 software []. Because of computational issues  we chose to estimate these parameters on a subset of first lactation records from the data  without considering repeatability. For milk production traits  these parameters were estimated using 113 980 first lactation records (49 201 for the Saanen and 64 779 records for the Alpine breed) from the population of all females born between 2008 and 2012. Since the data included fewer records for SCS and udder type traits  all first lactation records on all females born between 2002 and 2012 were used for these traits (i.e. 130 230 records for SCS and 202 102 for udder type traits). These analyses included 1985 females genotyped with the Illumina SNP50 BeadChip []  using the same quality control as for males. Genotyped females were groups of 100 half-sibs from 20 different sires [] involved in a design for quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection []. Cross-validation consisted in splitting the population of 677 progeny-tested and genotyped bucks into two sets: the training set (425 males born between 1993 and 2005: 232 Alpine and 193 Saanen individuals) and the validation set (252 males born between 2006 and 2009: 100 Saanen and 152 Alpine individuals). Phenotypes used for the training set were records of females born before 2008  i.e. the first year of lactation for daughters of bucks born in 2005. Prediction quality was evaluated based on Pearson correlations between GEBV and DYD [] for the validation males  and regression coefficients of DYD on GEBV. The DYD were obtained from official genetic evaluations (January 2013). These validation correlations serve as indicators of predictive ability and the regression coefficients (slopes) serve as indicators of the dispersion of GEBV; a slope above 1 indicates under-dispersion of GEBV and a slope below 1 indicates over-dispersion. Prediction error variances (PEV) of GEBV were estimated as in Misztal et al. [] by estimating the inverse of the coefficients matrix of the mixed-model equations [] using FORTRAN program accf90. Average model accuracies were derived from PEV as in Carillier et al. [] for the 148 young males that were not yet progeny-tested and born between 2010 and 2011. Prediction quality of validation males  and GEBV accuracy of young animals were analyzed both in the whole population (Alpine + Saanen animals) and also for each breed separately. Table  reports the estimates of heritability (h)  genetic variances and genetic correlations between Alpine and Saanen breeds for all traits studied. Standard errors of heritability ranged from 0.008 for udder type traits for the Alpine breed to 0.020 for milk production traits for the Saanen breed (results not shown). The highest heritabilities were found for protein content (around 0.6)  udder depth (around 0.55)  rear udder attachment (around 0.5) and fat content (0.5). SCS was the less heritable trait  with estimates of 0.2 and 0.16 in the Alpine and Saanen breeds  respectively. Heritability estimates obtained for milk production traits were close to those reported by Belichon et al. [] but they tended to be smaller  especially for fat yield in Alpine goats (0.28  0.37)  protein yield in Saanen goats (0.25  0.34)  and fat content in both breeds (0.48  0.58 and 0.51  0.60 in Alpine and Saanen goats  respectively). Our heritability estimates for udder type traits were much higher than those reported by Clément et al. []: 0.51 and 0.57  0.34 and 0.37 for udder floor position in the Alpine and Saanen breeds  respectively. These differences could be explained by the more recent data that were used here  with females born between 2008 and 2012  compared to the females born between 1998 and 1997 [] and 2000 and 2002 [] in other studies. Genetic parameter estimates for SCS were fairly similar to those reported by Rupp et al. []. Heritability estimates were similar for Saanen and Alpine goats except for udder shape (0.47  0.40)  udder floor position (0.57  0.51) and protein yield (0.25  0.31) (Table ). The largest between-breed differences in heritability were previously reported for udder shape (0.40  0.28 in Alpine and Saanen goats  respectively) and protein content (0.58  0.50) [] []. However  genetic variances in our study tended to differ between Alpine and Saanen populations (14.1  11.2 for instance for fat yield). Thus  the similar heritability estimates in the two breeds were explained by a similar ratio between genetic and residual variances  rather than similar variances. Estimates of the genetic correlation between traits in the Alpine and Saanen breeds ranged from 0.45 for milk yield to 0.76 for udder floor position (Table ). Standard errors of estimates of the genetic correlation ranged from 0.1 for udder type traits and protein content to 0.3 for SCS (results not shown). Estimates were close to those estimated between Holstein and Normande and between Montbéliarde and Normande dairy cattle breeds []  i.e. from 0.38 to 0.46 for milk yield and from 0.35 to 0.56 for fat content  but lower than the correlations between Holstein and Montbeliarde breeds (0.79 for milk yield and 0.66 for fat content). These results suggest that French Holstein and Montbeliarde dairy cattle breeds are genetically closer than the Alpine and Saanen goat breeds  perhaps due to the introgression of Red Holstein genes in the Montbéliarde breed in the 1980's. The highest correlations and the lowest standard errors of these correlations were obtained for udder floor position (0.76) and rear udder attachment (0.73). These high genetic correlations for udder type traits suggest that marker effects in the Alpine breed were closer to marker effects in the Saanen breed for these particular traits. To make results from the models comparable  GEBV from the within-breed model were centered on the overall average across the two breeds. For the within-breed model  validation correlations and slopes (Tables  and ) were estimated using the centered GEBV of all validation males (Alpine + Saanen). Table  reports the Pearson correlations between GEBV and DYD for the 252 validation males for all models. The correlations ranged from 0.33 for protein yield using the multi-breed model to 0.70 for protein content using the multi-breed or the multiple-trait model with <U+03C1> estimated or equal to 0. The highest correlations were obtained for traits with the highest heritabilities  i.e. for fat content (0.61)  protein content (0.70)  and rear udder attachment (0.64)  as previously also reported by Carillier et al. []. Using the within-breed model  validation correlations were slightly greater than with the multi-breed model  except for protein content (-1%) and teat angle (-3%). The largest increase was for protein yield (+9%). Other studies using within-breed models [] [] [] did not evaluate regression slopes and correlations of GEBV across breeds  which makes it difficult to compare results with our findings. The studies that compared multi-breed to within-breed genomic evaluations reported increases in validation correlations from 2% for milking ability in Finnish cattle to 50% for maternal calving in Swedish cattle [] and from 52% for milk yield to 80% for protein yield in Chinese bulls []. However  grouping several breeds (Holstein  Jersey and Brown Swiss) in the same training set could reduce validation correlations by 2% to 3% []. Validation correlations obtained with the multiple-trait models were close to those obtained with the within-breed and multi-breed models  with differences ranging from 1% for udder shape to 6% for fat content. In dairy cattle  Olson et al. [] found that the multiple-trait model outperformed (+9%) the multi-breed model in a two-step approach on de-regressed EBV. Using different values for the genetic correlation between Alpine and Saanen breeds (<U+03C1> = 0.99  <U+03C1> estimated and <U+03C1> = 0) did not have a major impact on correlations between DYD and GEBV (Table ). Differences ranged from 0% for SCS  udder floor position and udder shape  to 3.4% for teat angle. These results are consistent with those of Karoui et al. [] who observed no impact of the genetic correlation on validation correlations and regression coefficients. Comparison of the results obtained with the multi-breed model and with two-step approach [] shows that validation correlations using the single-step approach increased for all traits  by 10% for milk yield up to 74% for teat angle  expect for protein yield (-8%). Increases were greater for udder type traits (mean 59%) than for milk production traits (mean 14%). This is consistent with results found in a Lacaune dairy sheep population [] []  for which validation correlations increased from 11% for milk yield to 53% for udder depth. Previous studies using the pseudo-single-step approach led to intermediate results with increases in validation correlations from 0.1% to 10% in Nordic Holstein cattle [] and from 2% to 34% in Lacaune dairy sheep [] compared to the two-step approach. Estimates of the regression coefficients of DYD on GEBV for validation males (Table ) ranged from 0.43 for protein yield using the multi-breed model to 1.51 for rear udder attachment using the within-breed model. Standard errors of these estimates ranged from 0.06 for protein content with the multiple-trait model using the estimated <U+03C1> to 0.12 for milk yield with the multi-breed model. Based on these standard errors  no significant differences in slopes were observed between the models. The lowest regression coefficients of DYD on GEBV were found for protein yield (0.43 with the multi-breed model)  fore udder (0.55 with the multiple-trait model using the estimated <U+03C1>) and fat yield (0.61 with the multiple-trait model using <U+03C1> = 0). Slopes that were the furthest from 1 were obtained for traits with the lowest validation correlations between DYD and GEBV. It is difficult to interpret these slopes when the estimated validation correlations are not sufficient. However  slopes of DYD on GEBV less than 1  which indicates over-dispersion of GEBV  were observed for almost all traits except for protein content with the within-breed model  and for rear udder attachment and teat angle with the multiple-trait model using <U+03C1> = 0.99  as well as with the within-breed model for these three traits. Regression coefficients were slightly closer to 1 with the within-breed model than with the multi-breed model  i.e. by +6% for SCS to +57% for fore udder  except for fat (-8%) and protein contents and for rear udder attachment (Table ). These results indicate less dispersion of GEBV with the within-breed model than with the multiple-trait model for almost all traits. Using the multiple-trait model  slopes were slightly greater when <U+03C1> was estimated or equal to 0 (by 1% for fat yield with <U+03C1> = 0 to 48% for fore udder with <U+03C1> estimated) compared to the model with <U+03C1> = 1  as in the multi-breed model  except for some traits. Regression coefficients that were obtained with a genetic correlation estimated or equal to 0 were similar (equal or up to 2% different; Table ). The slopes obtained with <U+03C1> = 0.99 were consistent with those obtained with the two-step approach []  at 0.76  0.79 for example for milk yield. Using a genetic correlation of 0.99 greatly reduced the dispersion of the GEBV compared to other correlation levels  i.e. by 6% for udder shape to up to 61% for teat angle  but not for protein content or rear udder attachment. In the study by Karoui et al. []  slopes that were estimated using a between-breed genetic correlation of 0.95 were similar to those obtained with an estimated genetic correlation ranging from 0.38 to 0.79 for milk yield depending on the breeds considered. Regression coefficients obtained with the multi-breed single-step model were lower than those estimated with the two-step approach []  by 9% for udder floor position and by up to 43% for protein yield  except for protein content. The differences obtained in this study were consistent with those reported in the literature: 17% for final score in US Holstein bulls []  and from 12% for milk yield to 14% for SCS in Lacaune dairy sheep [] []. These regression coefficients were not as good as expected  although allele frequency differences between the genotyped and base-population animals [] were taken into account in the genomic relationship matrix using the approach of Christensen []. The correction of the genomic relationship matrix for differences between base-population and genotyped animals proposed by Vitezica et al. [] gave similar results for slopes of DYD on GEBV (results not shown). Gao et al. [] [] showed that in a Nordic Holstein dairy cattle population  the corrections done to the genomic relationship matrix as proposed in [] did not significantly reduce the over-dispersion of GEBV (from 0% to 3%) and even increased it in some cases (from 1% to 2%). Figure  shows the average model accuracies estimated on the 148 candidates using predictions based on the 677 males of the reference population. These accuracies ranged from 0.54 for fore udder using the within-breed model to 0.74 for fat and protein contents using the multi-breed model. The highest accuracies (on average 0.5 and 0.56 for fat and protein content  respectively) were obtained for traits with the highest heritabilities.  1 means similar results were obtained for the within-breed model and the multiple-trait model using <U+03C1> = 0.99; 2 means similar results were obtained for the within-breed model and the multi-breed model; 3 means similar results were obtained for the multi-breed model and the multiple-trait model using <U+03C1> = 0.99. M. trait means multiple-trait model. With the within-breed model  model accuracies were similar to those obtained with the multiple-trait model at <U+03C1> equal to 0.99 for milk  fat and protein yields and for udder floor position (Figure ). However  they were lower than with the multi-breed model  except for udder depth (+1.5%) and SCS (the same result was obtained with the three models). Reductions in accuracy when using the within-breed model compared to the multi-breed model ranged from -1% for protein content to -14% for fore udder. These results could be explained by the small size of the reference population of each breed. With the multiple-trait model  average model accuracy was higher when <U+03C1> was set equal to 0.99 than with the estimated <U+03C1>  which in turn was higher than with <U+03C1> set equal to 0. Accuracies with the multiple-trait model were lower than with the multi-breed model by -1% for protein yield to -5% for protein content  but slightly higher (by +1% to +3%) for teat angle  udder shape and rear udder attachment. The best model-based accuracies were obtained using the multi-breed model for milk production traits and using the multiple-trait model with <U+03C1> equal to 0.99 for SCS and udder type traits (Figure ). Compared to the two-step approaches []  the single-step approach increased model accuracy from 28% for udder type traits and SCS to 37% for milk  fat and protein yields. These model accuracies were greater than parent average accuracies for almost all traits  by 1% for rear udder attachment and teat angle with the multiple-trait model and the estimated <U+03C1>  to 14% for fat and protein contents using the multi-breed model. However  model-based accuracies did not exceed parent average accuracy for: (1) SCS and udder type traits with the multiple-trait model and <U+03C1> set to 0  (2) udder shape and fore udder with the within-breed model  and (3) SCS with the multiple-trait model and the estimated <U+03C1>. In Tables  and   GEBV from the multi-breed model were deviated from the mean GEBV of each breed to compare results from the multi-breed and the within-breed models. Table  shows Pearson correlations between GEBV and DYD for the 152 Alpine and 100 Saanen validation males using the within-breed and the multi-breed models. Correlations obtained with the multiple-trait models were similar to those with the multi-breed model (results not shown)  which is consistent with Makgahlela et al. []. The validation correlations were similar for the multi-breed and the within-breed models  except for fat yield in Saanen  protein yield in Alpine  and fat content in both breeds. In dairy cattle  combining several breeds in the training set did not improve validation correlations [] [] except for the Brown Swiss breed  which had the smallest population size []. The higher prediction ability obtained with the within-breed model compared to the multi-breed model (Table ) for fat content (0.55 vs 0.47 in Alpine and 0.65  0.53 in Saanen populations) could be explained by the presence of one of the mutations in the  gene in the Saanen breed but not in Alpine goats (C Maroteau  UNCEIA  Toulouse  personal communication). The validation correlations estimated in this study were higher for the Saanen breed than for the Alpine breed for almost all traits  from 18% for fat and protein content to 65% for fore udder (Table ). Similar results for the two breeds were obtained only for SCS  udder shape and teat angle. The absence of differences in phenotypic variances and DYD accuracies between the two breeds did not help to explain the difference in accuracies. However  this could be due to a higher inbreeding level in the Saanen breed (2.3% in Saanen vs 1.8% in Alpine) and a higher kinship coefficient between the training and testing sets (2.4% in Saanen vs 1.1% in Alpine  using genomic data). Thus  the larger training set size available for the Alpine breed did not counterbalance the smaller relationships between training and testing sets it had compared to the Saanen breed. Table  reports regression coefficients of DYD on GEBV for each breed with the multi-breed and the within-breed models. Slopes obtained with the multiple-trait model were similar to those obtained with the multi-breed model (results not shown). As mentioned previously  almost all slopes of DYD on GEBV were less than 1  which indicates over-dispersion of GEBV. Regression coefficients were closer to 1 in Saanen than in Alpine goats  except for protein content  SCS  rear udder attachment and teat angle. Since the validation correlations obtained for the Saanen breed were higher than for the Alpine breed  the best slopes were obtained for the Saanen breed. Differences between the two models were greater for regression coefficients than for accuracies and ranged from 1% for udder shape for the Alpine breed to 69% for fore udder for the Saanen breed. Nevertheless  these differences were small compared to the high standard errors of the slopes. Average model accuracies of the 148 candidates analyzed separately for each breed (results not shown) were little affected by the model used and were close to the accuracies analyzed by pooling Alpine and Saanen breeds together. Average model accuracies ranged from 0.62 for SCS  rear udder attachment and fore udder to 0.74 for protein content. Results on model accuracies were higher than expected given the small population size used in this study (86 Alpine and 62 Saanen individuals)  and were slightly higher (by +1% for protein content to +8% for udder depth) for the Saanen than for the Alpine goats. The better results obtained for the Saanen breed compared to the Alpine breed could be explained by a higher inbreeding level [] and kinship coefficient in the Saanen breed. Genetic selection in the French breeding programs for Alpine and Saanen breeds is achieved through within-breed selection. Therefore  to compare the three models proposed in this study  we need to focus on the within-breed comparisons but because of the small size of the reference population (less than 400 males in each breed)  multi-breed genomic evaluation has to be considered. This study compared three models (multi-breed  within-breed and multiple-trait) using a single-step approach for genomic evaluation. Quality of the predictions was similar for the three models  except for the dispersion of the GEBV  which was better with the within-breed model. The single-step approach resulted in higher prediction accuracy and over-dispersion of GEBV compared to the two-step approach. Average model accuracy for the candidates using a single-step approach outperformed the accuracy derived from pedigree-based parent average information from official evaluations  except for udder shape and teat angle. The best accuracies were obtained with the multi-breed model. Considering the small size of the population used in the within-breed model  accuracies were not expected to be high. A major gene or causal mutation specific to each breed ( and casein variant) could explain the good results obtained for the within-breed model. Based on prediction quality  there was no difference between the three models compared in this study. The most convenient model for genomic evaluation in French dairy goats would be the multi-breed model using a single-step approach. This model is the easiest to implement since it requires just one evaluation instead of two (multi-breed  within-breed) and less computing time than the multiple-trait model. However  the dispersion of the GEBV indicates that improvements are needed before this model can be viably implemented in official evaluations.

Therefore  the purpose of this study was a genome-wide mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nine body composition and bone mineral traits: absolute (Fat  Lean) and percentage (FatPC  LeanPC) fat and lean mass  live weight (Weight)  soft tissue X-ray attenuation coefficient (R)  absolute (BMC) and percentage (BMCPC) bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD).MethodsData on the nine traits investigated were obtained by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for 551 pigs that were between 160 and 200 days old. In addition  all pigs were genotyped using Illumina’s PorcineSNP60 Genotyping BeadChip. Based on these data  a genome-wide combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis was conducted. Thus  we used 44 611 sliding windows that each consisted of 20 adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For the middle of each sliding window a variance component analysis was carried out using ASReml. The underlying mixed linear model included random QTL and polygenic effects  with fixed effects of sex  housing  season and age.ResultsUsing a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold of  < 0.001  significant peaks were identified for all traits except BMCPC. Overall  we identified 72 QTL on 16 chromosomes  of which 24 were significantly associated with one trait only and the remaining with more than one trait. For example  a QTL on chromosome 2 included the highest peak across the genome for four traits (Fat  FatPC  LeanPC and R). The nearby gene    is known to be associated with body mass index in humans and involved in starvation in Drosophila  which makes it an extremely good candidate gene for this QTL.ConclusionsOur QTL mapping approach identified 72 QTL  some of which confirmed results of previous studies in pigs. However  we also detected significant associations that have not been published before and were able to identify a number of new and promising candidate genes  such as ."

Therefore  the purpose of this study was a genome-wide mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nine body composition and bone mineral traits: absolute (Fat  Lean) and percentage (FatPC  LeanPC) fat and lean mass  live weight (Weight)  soft tissue X-ray attenuation coefficient (R)  absolute (BMC) and percentage (BMCPC) bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD). Data on the nine traits investigated were obtained by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for 551 pigs that were between 160 and 200 days old. In addition  all pigs were genotyped using Illumina’s PorcineSNP60 Genotyping BeadChip. Based on these data  a genome-wide combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis was conducted. Thus  we used 44 611 sliding windows that each consisted of 20 adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For the middle of each sliding window a variance component analysis was carried out using ASReml. The underlying mixed linear model included random QTL and polygenic effects  with fixed effects of sex  housing  season and age. Using a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold of  < 0.001  significant peaks were identified for all traits except BMCPC. Overall  we identified 72 QTL on 16 chromosomes  of which 24 were significantly associated with one trait only and the remaining with more than one trait. For example  a QTL on chromosome 2 included the highest peak across the genome for four traits (Fat  FatPC  LeanPC and R). The nearby gene    is known to be associated with body mass index in humans and involved in starvation in Drosophila  which makes it an extremely good candidate gene for this QTL. Our QTL mapping approach identified 72 QTL  some of which confirmed results of previous studies in pigs. However  we also detected significant associations that have not been published before and were able to identify a number of new and promising candidate genes  such as . Domestication of the pig took place more than 9000 years ago. Since then  natural and artificial selection have led to the formation of many different breeds and strains. Currently  the pig is one of the most important livestock animals with more than 250 breeds worldwide. While most breeds (e.g. Large Black  Schwäbisch-Hällisch and Cerdo Iberico) serve mainly for commercial niche (high price) markets  for large-scale commercial pork production  only a few breeds (e.g. Large White  Landrace  Pietrain  Duroc and Hampshire) are used [] []. These major breeds are of enormous economic interest and thus  it is not surprising that much effort has been put into Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping in pigs during the last two decades (reviewed by [] []). Today  there are almost 10 000 QTL listed in the Pig QTL database (pigQTLdb  []; SS_10.2 downloaded on 04.02.2014). Among other reasons  insufficient resolution due to marker availability has limited traditional QTL analyses (many QTL cover more than 20 cM)  which has delayed identification of causal genes or variants []. However  recently  the availability of cost-effective genome-wide SNP genotyping has made it possible to map QTL more accurately and this has increased opportunities to identify candidate genes and/or to implement genomic selection. During the last years  the first genome-wide association studies using Illumina's Porcine SNP60 Genotyping Beadchip were published (e.g. []-[]). On the one hand  pig mapping data are important for long-term efficient pig breeding that integrates animal welfare. On the other hand  the pig is an extremely relevant animal model since it shares many genetic and physiological similarities with humans []. Thus  candidate regions/genes that are mapped for distinct traits in the pig can also be important for similar traits in humans and vice versa. In particular  loci associated with fatness and fat composition in pig can be relevant for the study of human obesity and obesity-associated diseases that are some of the most severe health issues [] [] [] []. In this study  we carried out a genome-wide (44 809 SNPs) combined linkage and linkage-disequilibrium analysis (LDLA) in a dataset of 551 pigs that were a mixture of the following breeds in various proportions: Large Black  Pietrain  Duroc  Schwäbisch-Hällisch  Cerdo Iberico  European Wild boar  and Hampshire. The whole body traits that were analyzed included four traits for body composition (Fat g  FatPC %  Lean g  LeanPC %)  three traits for bone mineral content and density (BMC g  BMCPC %  BMD g/cm)  the soft tissue X-ray attenuation coefficient (R) and live weight (Weight g). Except for Weight  all traits were obtained by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)  as described in Scholz and Förster [] and in Kremer et al. []. Although candidate gene analyses for leg weakness and bone mineral traits have been performed at local levels (e.g. []-[])  to our knowledge  this is the first genome-wide QTL mapping analysis for whole body bone mineral traits in pigs. Bone mineral traits are of special interest in pig production since they have been shown to be associated with osteochondrosis [] and bone fracture risk []. Thus  these traits are part of the multifactorial leg weakness syndrome which is a serious animal welfare issue and moreover causes considerable economic losses []-[]. Significant results (genome-wide -value < 0.001) of the genome-wide QTL mapping of these nine traits will be important for pig breeding. In addition  we identified QTL for Fat and FatPC that might represent regions of special interest for future analysis of obesity-related traits in humans. The trials reported in this work comply with the ethical guidelines of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich and were conducted with the approval of the appropriate ethics committee of the District Government of Upper Bavaria  Germany (No. 55.2-1-54-2532.2-60-07 and No. 55.2-1-54-2531.2-22-08). Moreover  blood sampling was conducted only by certified veterinarians who follow the German Animal Welfare Act to avoid any unnecessary pain  suffering and damage to the animals. For this study  554 blood samples of individuals between 160 and 200 days old were collected at the Livestock Center of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (Oberschleissheim  Germany). The animals sampled represented six different breeds (Duroc  Cerdo Iberico  Large Black  Hampshire  Pietrain  Schwäbisch-Hällisch) and included both purebred and crossbred individuals. In addition to these six breeds  crossbred animals included varying proportions (0 to 25%) of European Wild boar. For all individuals  weight was measured with a mechanic livestock scale for weights between 1 and 250 kg and eight body composition traits were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a pencil beam scanner \"GE Lunar DPX-IQ\" with the whole body mode \"adult normal\" (Lunar software version 4.7e  GE Healthcare  Pittsburgh  PA  USA)  as described in [] []. Values were predicted for bone mineral content in g (BMC) and percentage (BMCPC)  bone mineral density in g/cm (BMD)  fat tissue mass in g (Fat) and percentage (FatPC)  lean tissue mass in g (Lean) and percentage (LeanPC)  and the X-ray attenuation coefficient (R). Prior to DXA-scanning  animals were fasted for 16 hours. They were sedated by intramuscular injection of azaperone (Stresnil®: 1.2 mg/kg body weight) followed by ketamine (Ursotamin®: 40 mg/kg body weight) and then  an intravenous catheter was placed in an ear vein to continue ketamine administration if necessary. DNA extraction from blood samples was performed using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit from Qiagen. DNA of all sampled pigs was genotyped for 62 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using version 1 of the PorcineSNP60 Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  USA). The physical positions of all SNPs were downloaded according to the reference assembly SGSC Sscrofa10.2/susScr3 []. Markers that met one of the following criteria were excluded from further analysis: (i) successful genotyping results in less than 95% of the animals  (ii) frequent paternity conflicts in animals with known paternity  (iii) unknown or non-unique position according to the reference assembly susScr3  (iv) markers with a heterozygosity level less than 0.05 and (v) markers on porcine chromosomes X and Y since we concentrated on autosomes only. After this filtering process  the marker dataset comprised 44 809 markers. From the initial animal set  three individuals were excluded from further analysis because of a genome-wide genotyping call rate below 95% resulting in a final animal set of 551 animals. For haplotype reconstruction and imputation of missing genotypes  the Hidden Markov Model implemented in BEAGLE 3.0.4 was used []. Since additional animals and pedigree information improve the accuracy of haplotype reconstruction  we added another 49 animals that were otherwise not relevant for this analysis  and assigned all animals to three different groups: (i) 169 parent-offspring trios  (ii) 251 parent-offspring pairs and (iii) 151 unrelated individuals without any genotyped parent or offspring. It should be noted that some animals can be offspring in a pair and parent in a trio. Thus  the sum of all individuals in pairs  trios and the unrelated group exceeded the actual number of animals in the dataset. To correct for population stratification and family relationships within the mixed linear model used for QTL mapping (see below)  we estimated the unified additive relationships (UAR) between all animals []. Subsequently  all principal components of the UAR matrix were estimated using R []. The number of principal components to be integrated in the linear model was determined using the R package paran []  which is an implementation of the empirical method of Horn’s parallel analysis. Based on the so-defined 18 principal components  we were able to efficiently reduce the initial matrix dimensions from 551×551 to 18×551  without significant loss of information since these 18 principal components explained more than 90% of the genetic variance. Besides genome-wide relationships  local haplotype relationships were also included in the mixed linear model for QTL mapping. Genome-wide relationships were accounted for by using the 18 most significant principal components of the UAR matrix  while for local haplotype relationships we used sliding windows of 20 consecutive SNPs along the genome (larger windows of e.g. 40 SNPs also performed well and showed very similar results to the 20-SNP windows; data not shown). At each window-midpoint (i.e. between markers 10 and 11)  the locus identity by descent (LocIBD) was estimated based on the method described in Meuwissen and Goddard []. The resulting haplotype-based IBD matrices were then converted into diplotype relationship matrices () using the procedure described for additive genetic relationship matrices at a QTL ( matrix) in Lee and Van der Werf []. QTL mapping was carried out by a procedure that is equivalent to the combined linkage/linkage disequilibrium mapping method reported in Meuwissen et al. []. While linkage information was accounted for during reconstruction of haplotypes based on available relationships  linkage disequilibrium is considered in the estimation of LocIBD. Finally  a variance component analysis in the middle of each of the 20-SNP sliding windows was performed in ASReml []. The mixed linear model included random QTL effects based on   as well as the fixed effects of sex  housing  season  and the covariates of age at sampling and the 18 principal components to account for polygenic effects. Effects of additional corrections  such as pedigree-based breed compositions  were also tested  but since they were not significant  they were omitted from the final mixed linear model. The resulting model was: where  is a vector of phenotypes of the investigated trait   a vector of fixed effects (including overall mean   fixed effects  age at sampling and the 18 principal components)   a vector of random additive genetic effects due to QTL with  ~ N(0  )  where  is the diplotype relationship matrix at position  of the putative QTL and  a vector of random residual effects with  ~ N(0  )  where  is an identity matrix. The random effects  and  were assumed to be uncorrelated and normally distributed and their variances (  ) were simultaneously estimated using ASReml []. Using the logarithm of the likelihood estimated by ASReml for the model with (logL) and without QTL effects (logL; corresponding to the null hypothesis)  we calculated the likelihood ratio test statistic (LRT = -2(logL-logL))  which is known to be -distributed with one degree of freedom []. In order to keep the false discovery rate low  we chose a conservative significance threshold of LRT = 31.275  which corresponds to a -value less than 2.24*10 before correction for multiple-testing and a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide -value less than 0.001 based on 44 611 tested windows (0.001/44 611 = 2.24*10). For each peak that exceeded this LRT threshold  we determined the confidence interval (CI) of the position of the QTL using the 2-LOD (log of odds; 1 LOD = 4.605 LRT) drop-off criterion [] []. Overlapping CI of neighboring peaks for the same trait were combined into a single CI. In such cases  only the peak with the highest LRT was reported for the combined CI. Overlapping CI for different traits were assigned to a common QTL. For all genes within a QTL  a literature study was conducted to identify the QTL's candidate gene(s). As candidates we considered genes that fulfilled one of the following criteria: (i) genes within QTL for the same or related traits identified in previous studies in pig  (ii) known to be associated with related traits in other mammals or species and (iii) involved in pathways related to the investigated trait. As shown in Figure   significant associations of distinct chromosomal regions with phenotype were found for each of the nine traits investigated  except for BMCPC. However  the number of identified QTL varied considerably from 2 for BMD to 41 for FatPC. Chromosomes 8 and 14 showed no significant associations while the remaining chromosomes had up to 31 (SSC6) significant associations. Table  shows a summary of the significant associations and their confidence intervals (CI) identified per trait and chromosome. A total of 195 associations were identified for all traits  which represented 72 QTL. The CI of only 24 of the 195 associations did not overlap with the CI for another trait (See Additional file ).  LRT-values (y-axes) are shown for all nine traits and autosomes (x-axes); a red dashed line marks the genome-wide significance threshold of LRT = 31.275 ( < 0.001). Based on overlaps of CI between traits  two QTL stood out  i.e. one QTL on chromosome 6 between 7 006 410 and 14 176 920 bp and one QTL on chromosome 2 between 129 544 104 and 135 064 176 bp. Within the region on chromosome 6  the CI of seven traits (BMC  Fat  FatPC  Lean  LeanPC  R  Weight) overlapped and Weight had its highest LRT-value across the genome (53.279) in this region at position 8 723 052. The region on chromosome 2 included five significant traits (Fat  FatPC  LeanPC  R  Weight). Each of these traits  except Weight  had its highest LRT-values across the genome (54.78-58.1) in this region and at exactly the same position (133 237 232 bp). Peak-positions and CI of the highest genome-wide association for each trait are in Table . While BMC and BMD shared the highest peak at the same position (37 403 520 bp) in another region of chromosome 6  the greatest LRT for Lean (44.279) was on chromosome 12 (42 949 544 bp). Table  also lists candidate genes for each QTL. These candidates and additional interesting candidate genes will be discussed in the next section. It has been shown that a meta-analysis that combines data from multiple populations improves both power and resolution of QTL mapping (reviewed by []). This raises the obvious question of whether combining multiple populations in a single-QTL mapping study will also provide more significant results. As for F2 populations in line-cross models []  animal datasets that contain diverse populations and crosses should allow the mapping of QTL that are fixed in a population. In this paper  we show that diverse animal datasets such as the one used in this study can confirm many previously published QTL and  moreover  identify new unknown QTL. Overall  we found that most of the identified QTL (48 out of 72) affected more than one trait  which is not surprising since the traits studied are not completely independent. While relationships of Fat or Lean with the percentage traits FatPC and LeanPC  as well as with Weight are obvious  there is also a linear relationship between FatPC and ratio of the mass attenuation coefficients of soft tissue (R value = X-ray attenuation coefficient) []-[]. Moreover  it has been extensively shown in humans that obesity correlates with bone metabolism (reviewed by [] []). We will come back to these relations when discussing possible candidate genes (full names of all gene symbols mentioned hereafter are in Additional file ). It is worth mentioning that some of the mapped QTL lie in the vicinity of an even stronger QTL for the same trait(s). In such cases  further investigations  such as multiple-QTL analyses  are needed to clarify if these are separate QTL or rather represent carryover effects of nearby large QTL [] []. Nevertheless  for several of these \"possible carryover QTL\"  there is some indication that they are separate QTL since promising candidate genes could be defined within the CI of some QTL. For example on chromosome 7  there are seven non-overlapping CI for Fat and/or FatPC (referred to as CI1 to CI7 in the following) within a segment of 31 Mb (between 99 352 936 and 130 971 280 bp). Although  some of these could be caused by carryover effects  we were able to identify candidate genes within each CI  some of which were reported in previous QTL studies in pigs or were associated with functions related to body composition in pigs and other mammals: (i)  and  are good candidates for CI1 (between 99 352 936 and 102 221 456 bp) since the chromosomal segment containing these genes was reported to be associated with 10 rib backfat in pig []; (ii) for CI2 (between 104 522 416 and 105 871 296 bp)   was identified as a candidate gene since it may be involved in adipogenesis []; (iii)  is a candidate gene for CI3 (between 106 921 984 and 109 413 032 bp) because  knock-out mice were shown to be prone to obesity []; (iv)  was defined as a candidate gene for CI4 (between 110 964 904 and 116 355 960 bp) because it is part of a fine-mapped QTL (~3 Mb) for intramuscular fat content []; (v) for CI5 (between 117 489 560 and 120 450 760 bp)  we identified  as a promising candidate gene because it was reported to be a candidate gene for obesity in mice []; (vi) for CI6 (between 121 429 704 and 124 338 264)  the genes  and  overlapped with a chromosomal region that was reported to be associated with 10 rib backfat by Fan et al. []; and (vii) for CI7 (between 125 575 968 and 130 971 280 bp)  we identified  as a promising candidate gene since it was found to be associated with a number of fat deposition and carcass traits in pig []. However  without further analysis it is not possible to discriminate carryover effects from individual nearby QTL. All traits except BMCPC reached a genome-wide significance of  < 0.001. The eight highest peaks across the genome (one for each significant trait) belonged to four QTL on three chromosomes (Table ). The highest peaks of Fat (LRT = 58.1)  FatPC (56.16)  LeanPC (54.78) and R (55.82) were assigned to one of these QTL. Moreover  an additional significant peak for Weight (LRT = 37.899) fell within this confidence interval (Chr2:129 544 104–135 064 176). Since the peak positions for Weight  at 133 150 512 bp  and for the other traits  at 133 237 232 bp  were only separated by two markers  it can be assumed that all significant associations identified in this region share a common mechanism. The gene that is closest to both peaks according to the Ensembl genome browser [] is  located between 133 256 788 and 133 396 887 bp.  has been reported to be associated with body mass index (BMI) in humans [] []. Moreover  scribbler (sbb)  which is the  gene homologue in Drosophila []  is suggested to be involved in larval food search behavior under starvation conditions []. Although the molecular mechanisms that underlie the function of  are not clear []  it seems to play a fundamental role in related traits across species. Therefore   can be regarded as a candidate gene associated with body composition in pigs. Since the five traits that have significant associations in this region are not independent and Fat has the highest LRT while the non-significant trait Lean had the lowest LRT among all traits for this region except BMCPC  it can be hypothesized that  influences directly absolute fat mass and thereby indirectly the remaining traits (FatPC  LeanPC  R and Weight). The highest peak for Weight (LRT = 53.279) was observed at the beginning of chromosome 6 at 8 723 052 bp. The CI for this association (between 7 334 450 and 9 257 070 bp) included significant peaks for six other traits: Lean (LRT = 36.0)  BMC (36.6)  R (38.8)  LeanPC (38.92)  FatPC (39.1) and Fat (49.84). The genes closest to the peak based on NCBI Map Viewer are  between 7 681 404 and 7 695 761 bp at the proximal end and  in addition to a  gene (between 9 222 444 and 9 222 549 bp)  two genes near the distal end:  between 9 640 139 and 9 647 945 bp and  between 9 684 708 and 9 744 573 bp. Differential expression between human osteoarthritic and normal cartilage has been reported for [] and []  which indicates an association with bone formation. Thus   and  are promising candidate genes for BMC. Moreover  -deficient (-/-) mice die three weeks post-partum and display multiple postnatal defects  such as growth retardation and abnormalities in bone metabolism []. Therefore  it can be hypothesized that  variants could also affect growth in pigs and  thus  traits such as Weight  Lean  LeanPC  FatPC  Fat and the fat-related R. Another QTL on chromosome 6 had its highest peak across the genome at 37 403 520 bp for BMC (45.56) and BMD (35.14). At exactly the same position  Weight had a significant peak with an even higher LRT-value (45.76) than BMC and BMD. The CI for this QTL  from 36 937 640 to 37 714 128 bp  has no annotated gene  neither in Ensembl nor in the NCBI Map Viewer []. However  according to Ensembl  the two nearest genes are less than 150 and 30 kb apart from the CI position  i.e.  between 36 787 929 and 36 791 170 bp and  between 37 742 417 and 37 767 697 bp. No known information about  function suggests that it could be a candidate gene for BMC or BMD  but  has been shown to be associated with both muscle differentiation [] and lipid traits []. Thus  one hypothesis for this QTL could be that  assuming that both Fat and Lean are affected only moderately by a  variant in the same direction  there is no significant effect on either trait but the accumulated effects are significant for Weight. Since weight is known to influence bone mineral traits []  a significant change in Weight might also have significant effects on BMD and BMC. For example  Scholz et al. [] found a positive correlation of 0.85 between soft tissue mass and BMD (: adjusted R = 0.72). The highest peak for Lean (44.279) was identified on chromosome 12 at 42 949 544 bp. Within the CI for this association (between 41 217 576 and 45 554 716 bp)  we also detected significant peaks for BMC (31.28 at 42 637 020 bp) and Weight (35.439 at 42 365 148 bp). The three peaks are spread over a region that contains 33 markers and includes the genes  and    and   the novel protein coding gene  and one pseudogene (). For a number of chemokines  among which are    and   increased expression has been demonstrated in adipose tissue of obese human patients. Thus  it was hypothesized that chemokines might be involved in promoting adipose tissue inflammation in obesity []. Moreover  a relationship between higher serum levels of the inflammatory chemokines  and  with lower lean body mass has been shown in geriatric patients [].  is another interesting candidate gene within the CI of the peak for Lean. This gene is involved in neurofibromatosis type 1 in humans. Among other complications  affected individuals are likely to have low BMD  which is probably caused by  haploinsufficiency [] []. Moreover   seems to be essential for muscle development and metabolism  because  muscle-specific knock-out mice weigh significantly less than control mice []. Although  lies within the CI of a peak for Lean only  it is a remarkable candidate gene that could be directly involved in not only Lean but also Weight and BMC. Besides the candidate genes mentioned in the previous section  we were able to define at least one candidate gene for most (49 out of 72) of the QTL. For reasons of clarity  we will concentrate only on some of these candidate genes in the following  but in Additional files              and   all candidate genes are marked in bold letters. The QTL region on chromosome 6 for Fat  FatPC  LeanPC and R spans more than 5 Mb (between 133 183 304 and 138 202 064 bp). To date  this region contains more than 40 annotated genes based on Ensembl and NCBI Map Viewer. Among these  eight genes were considered as candidate genes for the associated traits:  () and . For  a correlation of the expression level with intramuscular fat has been confirmed in cattle []. The sub-region that contains        and  has been associated with backfat thickness in the Duroc pig breed [] and a segment that includes    and  was declared to be associated with intramuscular fat content in pigs [].  has been associated with backfat thickness in pigs and with obesity in humans [] [] []. In addition  Lee et al. [] detected significant associations with backfat thickness for both  and . Although to date  has not been positioned on the Sscrofa 10.2 assembly  it is assumed to be located next to  based on the human genome map and thus within the QTL region. For   significant associations with average daily weight gain and backfat thickness in Duroc pigs have been demonstrated []. Further evidence for a relation between  and fat-related traits is available from the literature  i.e. a highly significant differential expression of  in muscle tissue of pig breeds that display divergent obesity traits was reported by [] and an association between a non-coding variation in  and higher BMI was demonstrated in Native Americans []. Although the localization of  within our QTL region needs to be confirmed  it represents a promising candidate gene  especially for fat-related traits. Another candidate gene in this QTL region    has been shown to be significantly associated with BMI in humans []. Moreover  higher expression of  was detected in fast-growing compared to slow-growing chickens []. Overall  this QTL spans a chromosomal region that has been shown in many studies to be involved with  in particular  fat-related traits in pigs  cattle  humans  and mice. However  without further investigations we cannot narrow down the number of candidate genes or assess a possible interaction between several of these candidate genes. Thus  deciphering the cause of a QTL might be much easier for QTL that contain only few candidate genes. Some examples of such QTL will be discussed in the following. Within a 2 Mb QTL for Weight on chromosome 1  between 107 871 792 and 109 893 944 bp  which contains 20 genes  we identified two possible candidate genes:  and . In humans  LIPG expression was shown to be increased in obese individuals compared to normal weight individuals []. Therefore  we hypothesize that  may also be involved in lipid metabolism pathways in the pig and affect Weight.   the second candidate gene  encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of the mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation spiral []. Thus  since  is also involved in the pathway of fat metabolism  it may affect Weight. Another 1.5 Mb QTL that spans almost 20 annotated genes was detected for Fat on chromosome 1 (between 38 634 124 and 40 136 908 bp). A possible candidate gene for this QTL is  since loci near this gene were reported to be associated with waist-hip ratio in humans with European [] or African ancestry []. We mapped a 1.5 Mb QTL for FatPC and R (between 104 522 416 and 105 871 296 bp) on chromosome 7.  is the most promising candidate among the 13 genes in this chromosomal region based on results of Li et al. [] who demonstrated an association between a polymorphism in the  gene and growth and body composition traits in chickens  including weight of breast muscle and abdominal fat pad. Thus  it can be hypothesized that  variants influence both fat and lean mass  which may cause a significant change in FatPC and consequently in R. A QTL for FatPC and LeanPC that extended over less than 500 kb was detected on chromosome 12 (between 14 714 488 and 15 183 214 bp). We identified  as an obvious candidate gene for this QTL since Fontanesi et al. [] reported a significant association of a marker within the 3'-UTR region of  with backfat thickness in the Italian Large White pig breed. In addition  a premature stop codon in  causes an increased adipose tissue accumulation in zebrafish among other abnormalities (such as decreased somatic growth)  which supports the importance of  for fat-related traits  even across species []. Finally  we develop some reflections on our results in the light of the findings of Fan et al. [] since we detected numerous chromosomal regions that they had identified in their GWA study on body composition in pigs. Five of the chromosomal regions that Fan et al. [] found to be associated with last rib backfat or 10 rib backfat match QTL that we mapped for Fat or FatPC. Two other regions reported by Fan et al. [] overlap with QTL for Lean and another one with a QTL for Weight. It should also be noted that three candidate chromosomal regions detected for body length  hip structure  and weak top line overlap with QTL for Weight in our study. All genes that overlap with regions reported by Fan et al. [] are marked by asterisks in Additional files              and . A region that was associated with last rib backfat on chromosome 2 in Fan et al. [] overlapped with one of our QTL for Fat  FatPC  LeanPC  Weight and  R (between 7 012 572 and 9 118 948 bp). For this region  Fan et al. [] did not suggest a candidate gene. Interestingly  annotation of our QTL with the currently known genes revealed two genes   (between 7 350 357 and 7 352 786 bp) and  (between 7 355 161 and 7 364 707 bp)  within this region that were not reported by Fan et al. []  which suggests that these genes were annotated in the pig genome only recently. Hurov et al. [] showed that a loss of the MARK2 polarity kinase leads to decreased adiposity. No association with appropriate traits has been established for . Thus   is a candidate gene for both the QTL detected in our study and the region associated with last rib backfat thickness in Fan et al. []. Our LDLA-based QTL mapping approach revealed significant peaks for all traits except for BMCPC. Most of the 72 identified QTL were associated with more than one trait and some of these associations confirmed previously reported results in pigs. However  we also detected significant associations in regions that have not been published before. Based on the literature  we identified candidate genes for most of the detected QTL and suggest a number of new and promising candidate genes  such as  or .

The Australian Beef Cooperative Research Center (Beef CRC) investigated these issues by deriving genomic prediction equations (PE) from a training set of animals that covers a range of breeds and crosses including Angus  Murray Grey  Shorthorn  Hereford  Brahman  Belmont Red  Santa Gertrudis and Tropical Composite. This paper presents accuracies of genomically estimated breeding values (GEBV) that were calculated from these PE in the commercial pure-breed beef cattle seed stock sector. PE derived by the Beef CRC from multi-breed and pure-breed training populations were applied to genotyped Angus  Limousin and Brahman sires and young animals  but with no pure-breed Limousin in the training population. The accuracy of the resulting GEBV was assessed by their genetic correlation to their phenotypic target trait in a bi-variate REML approach that models GEBV as trait observations. Accuracies of most GEBV for Angus and Brahman were between 0.1 and 0.4  with accuracies for abattoir carcass traits generally greater than for live animal body composition traits and reproduction traits. Estimated accuracies greater than 0.5 were only observed for Brahman abattoir carcass traits and for Angus carcass rib fat. Averaged across traits within breeds  accuracies of GEBV were highest when PE from the pooled across-breed training population were used. However  for the Angus and Brahman breeds the difference in accuracy from using pure-breed PE was small. For the Limousin breed no reasonable results could be achieved for any trait. Although accuracies were generally low compared to published accuracies estimated within breeds  they are in line with those derived in other multi-breed populations. Thus PE developed by the Beef CRC can contribute to the implementation of genomic selection in Australian beef cattle breeding. Genomic selection (GS) has been introduced into breeding schemes of many livestock species []-[]. The advantages of GS compared to conventional breeding schemes can be summarised as: (i) shortening the generation interval because genomically estimated breeding values (GEBV) can be calculated early in life  (ii) estimation of GEBV for all genotyped individuals of a species/breed for difficult to measure traits given a prediction equation (PE) that has been derived from a related population and (iii) increased accuracy of estimated breeding values for lowly heritable traits [] []. Since in beef cattle breeding  selection candidates usually have some of their own performance records before the selection decision is made  the generation interval is usually not a constraint for the genetic progress. Thus  advantages (ii) and (iii) are the key improvements for Australian beef cattle breeding schemes expected from the implementation of GS []. In the dairy industry  several conditions have facilitated the implementation of GS: (1) a large number of phenotypes is collected routinely; (2) wide-spread use of artificial insemination facilitates the use of highly accurate conventionally estimated sire breeding values as pseudo-phenotypes; and (3) large breeding organisations can bear the initial cost of genotyping. Currently  these conditions are not met in the Australian beef cattle industry. On the contrary  the Australian beef industry is made up of a large number of breeds and crosses (both  and )  breeding organisations are rather small  and records of economically important traits on live animals or carcasses are usually expensive to measure and limited in number  as are the genotypes of phenotyped individuals []. This situation is reflected in low numbers of genotyped individuals which are generally not sufficient to calculate accurate within-breed GEBV. A possible approach to make GS feasible for breeds with a small number of genotypes and phenotypes is the derivation of PE that allow prediction of GEBV across breeds [] []. This derivation is usually done on a mixed breed training population that contains individuals of all targeted breeds. Thus  the number of genotyped individuals in the reference population might exceed the total number of genotyped individuals in any single breed  which may allow for a higher power to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with trait coding quantitative trait loci (QTL). However  whether all or only the small breeds gain from this approach depends on the proportions of each breed in the training population []. The across-breed-prediction approach was followed by the Australian Beef Cooperative Research Center (  Beef CRC)  which derived PE on a pooled training population of genotyped individuals from eight different cattle breeds and on different cross-breed and pure-breed subsets of this pooled set  in which the genotyped individuals originated from Australian populations of Angus  Murray Grey  Shorthorn  Hereford  Brahman  Belmont Red  Santa Gertrudis  Tropical Composite breeds  and F1 crosses of Brahman with Limousin  Charolais  Angus  Shorthorn and Hereford breeds []. Beef CRC PE were derived for the commercial animal breeding sector. The value of the PE for breeders depends on the accuracy of the resulting GEBV. This accuracy is the proportion of the additive genetic variance of the focused phenotypic trait  estimated in the commercial seed stock population  that is explained by the GEBV. Common approaches to assess the accuracy and the PE consist in subdividing of the training data and a subsequent n-fold cross-validation  or the derivation of the PE in generation  and the derivation of the accuracy in generation +  ?1 []-[]. However  in both cases  the accuracy is usually calculated as a product moment correlation  sometimes scaled by some value. Whether accuracies obtained in this way are also achievable in the commercial seed stock population depends on a variety of factors such as the genetic distance between the commercial and the training population [] and the sample size of the training population. Another approach to obtain an estimator of the proportion of the additive genetic variance in the seed stock population explained by the GEBV is to apply PE to genotyped seed stock individuals  model the resulting GEBV as trait observations in a bi-variate approach together with their phenotypic target trait and assess the co-variances by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or Gibbs sampling []-[]. This approach accounts for various sources of bias in parameter estimation  including genetic trends  relatedness between individuals  inbreeding and differences in accuracy of EBV. In addition  the genetic correlation between the phenotypic target trait and the GEBV that is obtained this way is an indispensable part of the blending of EBV with GEBV. The aim of this work was to determine whether Beef CRC PE derived within and across breeds facilitate the introduction of GS in the Australian commercial beef cattle seed stock herds. For this purpose  GEBV were calculated for genotyped seed stock animals of Australian Angus  Limousin and Brahman breeds  thus  subsets of those populations Beef CRC PE have been derived for  and their accuracy was assessed as the genetic correlation to their phenotypic target trait in a bi-variate REML approach. The assembly of the training population  genotyping of training individuals and PE derivation were not part of this project. For a detailed description of the PE derivation and the size  breed composition and animal characteristics of the training population see []. However  in short  PE supplied to the authors were derived within the Beef CRC on 800K Illumina HD Bovine genotypes in a 5-fold cross-validation genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) approach with phenotypic records as response variables []. PE were developed for the following traits: post-weaning live weight (g.WW)  live weight on feedlot entry (g.YW)  live weight on feedlot exit (g.FW)  carcass rib fat (g.CRIB)  carcass P8 fat (g.CP8)  carcass intra-muscular fat (g.CIMF) and carcass weight (g.CWT). For a list of GEBV and their abbreviations see Table . Genotyped training animals originated from Australian populations of the Angus  Murray Grey  Shorthorn  Hereford  Brahman  Belmont Red  Santa Gertrudis  Tropical Composite breeds  and F1 crosses of the Brahman breed with the Limousin  Charolais  Angus  Shorthorn and Hereford breeds  and included cows  steers and bulls. For each of the above traits  PE were derived on four sets of individuals: all genotyped animals across breeds (ALL)  Angus only (ANGUS)   only (Angus  Murray Grey  Hereford  Shorthorn) (BOSTAURUS) and Brahman only (BRAHMAN). The ALL  ANGUS  BOSTAURUS and BRAHMAN PE were applied to genotypes of commercial seed stock animals that originated from Australian populations of the Angus  Limousin and Brahman breeds. None of these genotyped individuals were in the training population. This set of animals will be referred to as “validation set”. For all three breeds  the validation set consisted of widely used sires and animals from the current generation. The numbers of individuals (sires/animals in the current generation) in each breed sample were 1582 (383/1199) for Angus  782 (368/414) for Limousin  and 400 (108/302) for Brahman. After removing individuals that did not match the breed specific pedigrees  the validation sets consisted of 1487 Angus  721 Limousin and 400 Brahman individuals. Genotypes of all validation animals were obtained using the Illumina 50K Bead Chip. To apply Beef CRC PE  all genotypes were imputed from 50K to 800K. Imputation was done with a population-based approach [] using 800K Beef CRC genotypes []  and 2500 800K genotypes of Limousin  Charolais and Simmental individuals  supplied by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF)  as reference genotypes. The population approach was necessary because many of animals in the current generation were not registered at the time of imputation  which made it impossible to exploit possible duo or trio structures in the data because of unknown parents. Finally  GEBV were calculated by applying the above described PE to the animals’ genotypes. The phenotypic datasets and pedigree data of all three breeds were obtained from databases of their respective breed societies: Angus Australia  Australian Limousin Breeders’ Society and Australian Brahman Breeders’ Association. All phenotypic data were adjusted for systematic effects as described in []. For all traits and breeds  the number of records in the phenotypic datasets exceeded those of the GEBV datasets. For Angus  some individuals that were used in the training population were also part of the phenotypic datasets (see Table ). Phenotypic traits included in the analysis were 200-day weight (p.WW)  400-day weight (p.YW)  600-day weight (p.FW)  bull’s scan eye muscle area (p.BEMA)  heifer’s scan eye muscle area (p.HEMA)  bull’s scan rib fat (p.BRIB)  heifer’s scan rib fat (p.HRIB)  bull’s scan P8 fat (p.BP8)  heifer’s scan P8 fat (p.HP8)  carcass rib fat (p.CRIB)  carcass P8 fat (p.CP8)  carcass intra-muscular fat (p.CIMF) and carcass weight (p.CWT). Note that not all traits were available for each breed. For a list of phenotypic traits and their abbreviations see Table . Contemporary groups were formed as defined in [] but all single record groups were deleted. For p.WW  p.YW and p.FW  records were excluded if the sire  dam  maternal grandsire or embryo transfer recipient dam was unknown. Multiple records of these traits were also deleted except for the first. In order to decrease the computational demand  the number of Angus records for p.WW and p.YW was further reduced as follows: records were kept only if the recorded individual was part of the validation set  or was a direct progeny of an individual in the validation set  or was in a contemporary group with an individual that belonged to one of the latter two groups. Variances and variance ratios were obtained from bi-variate REML analysis for which each phenotypic trait was analysed in conjunction with its assigned GEBV. The fitted model for p.WW  p.YW and p.FW and their respective GEBV was: where                  and  are vectors of phenotypic observations  GEBV  fixed effects of the phenotypic trait  the mean of the GEBV  random direct additive genetic effects of the GEBV  random direct additive genetic  random maternal additive genetic  random maternal environmental and random residual effects of the phenotypic trait and random residual effects of the GEBV  respectively.        and  are incidence matrices relating the effects to their phenotypic observations or GEBV  respectively  and  is a vector of 1s. Random effects in the model were assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with where  is the numerator relationship matrix constructed such that every individual with a phenotypic or GEBV observation had at least three generations of ancestors in the pedigree if available  and  is an identity matrix.  is the variance of the direct additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait   is the variance of the direct additive genetic effect of the GEBV   is the variance of the maternal additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait   is the covariance between the direct additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait and the maternal additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait   is the covariance between the direct additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait and the direct additive genetic effect of the GEBV   is the covariance between the direct additive genetic effect of the GEBV and the maternal additive genetic effect of the phenotypic trait   is the variance of the maternal permanent environmental effect   is the variance of the residual effect of the phenotypic trait   is the variance of the residual effect of the GEBV  and  is the co-variance of the residual effect of the GEBV and the residual effect of the phenotypic trait. The fitted bi-variate model for all other phenotypic traits and their respective GEBV was: with random effects assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with For phenotypic traits  contemporary group was the only fixed effect  and for GEBV only the mean was fitted as a fixed effect. Note that the residual covariance was fitted only for the combinations of GEBV and phenotypic traits where a subset of the individuals had observations on both  the GEBV and the phenotypic trait. Imputation was done with Beagle [] without exploiting any parent-offspring pair/parent-offspring trio structure. The number of iterations in Beagle was set to 30. Pre- and post-analysis data manipulation was done with R [] and Sweave []. REML analyses were carried out with WOMBAT []. Table  summarises the results for all phenotypic traits across breeds for the following parameters: number of observations  mean  standard deviation and number of animals that are in common between the phenotypic dataset and the training population. The number of observations for growth traits exceeded those for the difficult and expensive-to-measure carcass traits for all three breeds. Large numbers of records for live animal ultrasound scan traits were available for the Angus breed only  whereas for the Brahman and Limousin breeds records of these traits were almost as limited as those for carcass traits. An overlap between the phenotypic dataset and the training dataset was found for the Angus breed only  which means that in this case the datasets were not totally independent. However  only for p.CRIB  could the proportion of training individuals used in the phenotypic dataset (573 of 1203 phenotypic observations) have caused an upward biased accuracy. For all other traits  this proportion was zero or negligible due to more phenotypic records and less training individuals in the phenotypic dataset. As mentioned above  none of the genotyped validation animals were used in the training population. However  the mean  minimum and maximum relationships between the validation individuals and those training individuals of the same breed  based on a pedigree constructed for these animals three generations back  were equal to 0.014  0.0 and 0.57 for Angus  and 0.008  0.0 and 0.57 for Brahman. Note that the mean relationship includes only training individuals of the same breed as the target population. Thus  for mixed-breed training populations  this number is even smaller when all training individuals are included  and if the training population and the target population represent different breeds  all three parameters are equal to 0. Table  summarises heritabilities (h) and their standard errors for all GEBV. Across traits and PE high h of almost 1 with the lowest standard errors were found consistently for the Angus breed only. For the Brahman breed  in most cases the h values were below 0.9. Across traits  the lowest h values were always estimated for the GEBV calculated from the ANGUS PE  followed by those from the BOSTAURUS PE and BRAHMAN PE. The highest h were almost exclusively estimated for ALL PE GEBV  except for g.WW which was below 0.9. In most cases  the standard errors of h for the Brahman breed GEBV were above 0.1  and therefore about five times as large as those for Angus  which reflects the size of the Brahman sample. The lowest h across traits and PE were found for the Limousin breed with most values below 0.6 and the lowest estimates equal to 0.42 for g.SRIB from ALL PE. In contrast to Brahman  no generally superior or inferior PE could be identified for Limousin. Heritabilities from the uni-variate analysis were not different to those from the bi-variate analysis (results not shown). Table  summarises the genetic correlations (r) between GEBV and phenotypic traits for the Australian Angus breed. The highest r (0.53) was found for p.CRIB :g.CRIB derived from BOSTAURUS PE  the lowest (-0.01) for p.BP8 :g.SP8 derived from BRAHMAN PE  but most values were below 0.2. Across all traits  ALL PE and BOSTAURUS PE yielded the highest r followed by ANGUS and BRAHMAN PE  where the ALL PE results almost mirrored those from ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE. BRAHMAN PE was inferior for carcass traits  whereas for growth traits (except p.FW :g.FW) differences between r of GEBV from different PE were small. As a result of the number of phenotypic observations  standard errors of r for growth traits were below 0.1  but much larger for carcass traits for which fewer data were available. For the Limousin breed  r varied more than for the Angus breed  and their standard errors were much greater (see Table ). Across traits and PE r varied from 0.63 to -0.69 for p.CP8 :g.CP8 estimated from BOSTAURUS PE and BRAHMAN PE  respectively. No clear pattern regarding superior or inferior PE could be identified because r varied considerably within traits across PE. For example  r of p.WW :g.WW was -0.02 from ALL PE  0.22 from ANGUS PE  0.08 from BOSTAURUS PE and -0.03 from BRAHMAN PE. Table  summarises the GEBV r for Australian Brahman  which varied across traits and PE from 0.7 (p.CRIB :g.CRIB from ALL PE) to -0.5 (p.CIMF :g.CIMF from ANGUS PE). However  negative r were exclusively found in ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE. Moreover  results from ALL PE almost mirrored those from BRAHMAN PE  whereas ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE yielded much smaller or even negative r. Standard errors decreased with the availability of more phenotypic data (low for carcass traits and high for growth traits)  and were similar across PE  except for most carcass traits  for which standard errors from ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE were double those from ALL and BRAHMAN PE. Across-breed PE were derived by the Beef CRC to facilitate the implementation of GS in the Australian beef cattle industry  which is made difficult by the large number of breeds  small numbers of individuals with genotypes and/or phenotypes per breed and their unequal distribution across breeds  and the widespread use of cross-breeds. It has been proposed that PE derived from large mixed-breed samples may circumvent these problems. Moreover  the power of detection of SNPs in high LD with a QTL that affects the phenotype of interest is expected to increase when mixed-breed data is used [] []. Accuracy of GEBV derived from Beef CRC PE in a 5-fold cross-validation approach were published by []. Since Beef CRC prediction equations were developed for application in the Australian commercial beef cattle seed stock herds  the aim of this work was to validate accuracies in these herds via a bi-variate REML approach. In addition  estimated parameters are a precondition for blending estimated breeding values with GEBV. Accuracies of GEBV from ALL PE for Australian Angus were calculated as REML genetic correlations between GEBV and their phenotypic target traits  and were found to be considerably different to those given by []. For instance cross-validation accuracies of g.WW  g.YW  g.SRIB and g.SP8 for the Angus breed were reported to be equal to 0.27  0.42  0.42 and 0.5 respectively  while the values estimated in our study were 0.09  0.08  0.26 and 0.25 respectively. On the contrary  cross-validation accuracies for g.SEMA  g.CIMF and g.CWT reported by [] were equal to those found here (0.15 vs. 0.15  0.31 vs. 0.33) or lower (0.16 vs. 0.25). However  the standard errors of our results do not allow us to draw an unambiguous conclusion on whether the latter three estimates are significantly different from 0. For the Brahman breed  accuracies published by [] for g.WW  g.YW and g.SEMA were also considerably higher than those obtained from ALL PE. In contrast  for g.SP8 and g.CIMF  ALL PE yielded higher accuracies (0.34 vs. 0.19  0.56 vs. 0.27). However  for these GEBV the standard errors do not support the conclusion that accuracies are significantly different from 0. One possible reason for the differences is the genetic distance between our validation dataset and the training dataset. The Beef CRC collection of genotypes started in the early 2000. Thus  the distance between some validation and training genotypes might represent several generations. Moreover  some genotypes were collected from special selection lines []. Compared with the range of results published in other studies  the accuracies of GEBV for Australian Angus presented here are generally at the lower end of the range [] [] []-[]. For example accuracies of GEBV that are commercially available from Igenity () for growth traits  carcass marbling and carcass weight in Australian/American Angus were generally higher than 0.4 [] []. In contrast  especially for growth traits  our values were lower than 0.1 except the accuracy of g.FW. The same applies to GEBV that are commercially available from Zoetis () [] []. In all the studies cited above  GEBV were evaluated within-breed only  but Beef CRC PE were derived across indicine and taurine breeds. Studies on beef cattle across-breed predictions are limited [] []  but accuracies of g.CIMF and g.WW reported here were in the same range than those in []. However  accuracies of g.YW was ? 0.1  whereas results of both the latter citations were between 0.3 and 0.45. Moreover  [] found an accuracy of g.WW of 0.36  compared to our result of 0.09 from ALL PE. Differences between accuracies obtained from different PE were minor except between the BRAHMAN PE and the other three PE. The small differences in accuracies obtained from the ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE may result from the  training set consisting of almost 50% Angus individuals []. However  the addition of indicine breeds to the training set  which represented about 60% of the ALL PE training set  had small positive effects on the accuracies of almost all GEBV. In contrast  the BRAHMAN PE performed worst in the Angus breed for most traits  which combined to the results from ALL PE  reinforces the empirical finding that the target breed must be a member of the training population []. However  given the high standard errors  in general differences between accuracies obtained from different PE for a given trait were not statistically significant. Accuracies of GEBV from ALL PE for the Limousin breed reflect that no pure-breed Limousin individuals were part of the training population. Generally  accuracies reported here do not show any consistent pattern within traits across PE. In contrast  accuracies for the American Limousin population from within-breed predictions were equal to ?0.4  and for yearling weight  they even reached 0.76 []. Moreover  accuracies of GEBV predicted from PE derived from a cross-breed population that consisted of only about 7% Limousin genome were between 0.2 and 0.65 depending on the trait []. For the Brahman breed  the only pure-breed  cattle in the training population  the ALL PE yielded the highest accuracies for most GEBV  followed by the BRAHMAN PE  whereas the ANGUS and BOSTAURUS PE yielded negative results in most cases. The poor performance of the BOSTAURUS and ANGUS PE is in line with the poor performance of the BRAHMAN PE in the Angus breed  which reflects the need of having all predicted breeds in the training population. The better performance of the ALL PE compared to the BRAHMAN PE might result from additional information embedded in the LD between certain SNPs and QTL across  and  sub-species  in conjunction with a higher power of detection due to an increased training population size [] []. However  the standard errors of the accuracies do not allow for a statistically based preference of a certain PE. Low heritabilities of GEBV indicate that our results for the Limousin breed and partly for the Brahman breed may be affected by genotyping errors  pedigree errors or very low relationships between individuals with GEBV. For the Limousin and Brahman breeds  heritabilities varied considerably within traits across PE (e.g. for g.WW 0.5 to 0.65 for Limousin  0.64 to 0.84 for Brahman). Since GEBV are linear functions of SNP genotypes  and SNP genotypes were the same for all PE  the heritabilities of GEBV for the same trait from different PE were expected to be equal. This assumption holds only if genotypes are obtained without errors  or if genotyping and imputation errors affect all SNPs equally. If some SNPs are more affected by errors than others and the PE weight SNPs differently  the heritabilities of GEBV for a certain trait from different PE may vary although the same animals and genotypes were used. However  this is only expected to be the case when evaluating PE in target populations because poor genotyping/imputation quality of individuals in the training population is accounted for by the prediction equation via altered GEBV accuracy. Thus  if the genotypes of validation animals were affected by imputation errors  accuracies of GEBV may increase as a result of an increased imputation accuracy. Genomic PE are usually derived to implement GS in certain target populations by supplying the PE or GEBV to the breeding organisations. The parameter of paramount interest when evaluating PE or GEBV is the proportion of the additive genetic variance of the phenotypic target trait in the target population explained by the GEBV  where the square root of this parameter is the accuracy of the GEBV. From the perspective of the breeding organisation  this parameter can be obtained either by using the accuracy generated during the process of generating the PE  which assumes that this accuracy is equal to a variance ratio  or by re-estimating this parameter in the target population. Using the accuracy from the PE generation process bears the risk of assuming the GEBV to be more accurate than they actually are if the genetic link to the training population is insufficient []  or if the training population sample size does not reflect the genetic variability in the target population because parameters estimated in the training population may not be valid in the target population. This problem can be circumvented by re-estimating the accuracy in the target population. However  accuracies from the process of generating the PE as well as those re-estimated in the target population can be biased due to the method of calculation. The accuracy of GEBV is often estimated as the correlation between the GEBV and a response variable  which can be breeding values  de-regressed proofs  daughter yield deviations  phenotypes or scaled versions of these variables. The co-variances necessary to calculate the correlation are obtained from inner-space vector products of the GEBV vector and the response variable vector [] [] []. The expectation of the inner-space vector product of two random vectors with expectation 0 is the trace of their co-variance matrix. Assuming that the co-variance matrix is a matrix times a scalar co-variance  the inner-space vector product will estimate the scalar co-variance correctly only if the average diagonal element of the matrix is 1. If the average is larger than 1  it will inflate the co-variance. Thus  if the covariance matrix between the response variable and the GEBV is the genomic relationship matrix times their covariance  and the average diagonal element of the genomic relationship matrix is larger than 1  the covariance will be biased upwards  and the accuracy will be overestimated. Moreover  genetic trends due to selection may further increase the inner-space vector product due to a mean of the random vectors larger than 0. In addition to the possible bias from transferring GEBV accuracies to the target population and from the method of calculation  the above methodology does not exploit all available phenotypic data when deriving the PE or when estimating the GEBV accuracy. PE using all available data can be derived by a single-step methodology and back-solving the single-step breeding values []-[]. However  an accuracy in the sense of the proportion of the additive genetic variance explained by GEBV cannot be achieved from such analysis. The REML approach used in this article and by []-[] overcomes several of the above outlined shortcomings by re-estimating the accuracy in the target population  using as much phenotypic data as available  allowing for sources of bias in parameter estimation due to relationships between individuals  selection and inbreeding  and generating the parameter of paramount interest  the proportion of the genetic variance of the target trait in the target population explained by the genetic covariance between the target trait and the GEBV. Across-breed prediction has its theoretical basis in the finding that the LD between SNPs persists over much longer genome distances within breed than across breeds  and in the assumption that trait coding QTL are the same across breeds. Thus  mixing breeds may lead to a sample with most advanced LD decay between QTL and SNPs such that across all breeds in this sample only SNPs in close proximity to the QTL are still in high LD [] [] []. Up to this point  this theory is supported by the fact that ALL PE worked best in Angus  followed by ANGUS  BOSTAUR and BRAHMAN PE. However  a consequence of the above logic is that the addition of a breed “N” to a training population of “N-1” breeds must be of decreasing marginal benefit  because the total probability that the LD between QTL and their adjacent SNPs is already exploited increases with every additional individual and/or breed. In practical terms  in a set of “N” breeds  GEBV for breed “N” should be predictable with high accuracy from a training set of “N-1” breeds. Violation of the equal QTL assumption does not invalidate the marginal benefit principle. It also applies when breeds have specific QTL alleles due to mutation or due to an ancestral population with more than two QTL alleles  as long as the LD phase between SNPs and negative/positive QTL alleles is the same for all breeds in the training population. Results in this paper  as well as those published from other across-breed prediction trials [] [] []  show that all breeds in the target/validation population must be part of the training population to obtain sufficient GEBV accuracies. In the framework of the above theory and its marginal benefit consequence  the conclusion would be that the Limousin and Angus breeds are genetically more different than are the Angus and Brahman breeds  with this difference including different trait coding QTL  inversion of LD phases  fixed SNPs  and SNPs in linkage equilibrium with trait coding QTL. Since such a conclusion contradicts the phylogeny of cattle breeds  the empirical result that across-breed PE yield accurate GEBV only if all targeted breeds are in the training population does not fit into the above genetic theory. To date  the fact that across-breed prediction works only if all targeted breeds are in the training population may result from partial or total collinearity between very distant SNP genotypes. Collinearity between SNP genotypes can be a result of a physical proximity between two SNPs in terms of base pairs  and can persist over many generations after being induced by an ancient sampling event (e.g. the breed formation). However  collinearity may be also observed between distant SNP genotypes which can be induced by a recent sampling event  for instance sampling a number of individuals for genotyping of which SNP haplotypes do not reflect the genetic diversity in the original population  which is facilitated by the number of SNPs usually exceeding the number of genotyped animals. Such “genotype sampling collinearity” between SNP genotypes in close proximity to a QTL and SNP genotypes very distant from this location will result in LD between QTL and these very distant SNPs. When estimating SNP effects  both types of SNPs will then compete for the effect of the same QTL. Since this kind of collinearity is likely to change with every single individual or breed added to the training population  the prediction equation will change subsequently. How well prediction equations can be transferred to other populations is a function of this change. The empirical finding that targeted breeds must be members of the training population to successfully apply the prediction equation supports the conclusion that much of the LD in current across-breed data sets is induced by the sampling event which arises when individuals are chosen for genotyping. Although accuracies of GEBV are generally low compared to already published accuracies that are estimated within breeds  they are in line with those derived from other across-breed prediction trials. Thus  prediction equations derived by the Beef CRC from a mixed-breed training population can contribute to the implementation of genomic selection in Australian beef cattle breeding. Since across-breed prediction equations performed equally or better than the within-breed prediction equations  and the mixed-breed dataset is likely to grow faster than the pure-breed dataset  we recommend that breeders use prediction equations from the mixed-breed training population. However  breeding organisations should only implement GS on the basis of Beef CRC across-breed equations if their breed was part of the training population.

"Improving the accuracy of genomic prediction in Chinese Holstein cattle by using one-step blending"	"Authors: Xiujin Li  Sheng Wang  Ju Huang  Leyi Li  Qin Zhang and Xiangdong Ding"	"Laboratory of Animal Genetics  Breeding and Reproduction  Ministry of Agriculture of China  National Engineering Laboratory for Animal Breeding  College of Animal Science and Technology  China Agricultural University  Beijing  100193  ChinaXiujin Li  Sheng Wang  Ju Huang  Leyi Li  Qin Zhang & Xiangdong Ding"	"No Co-Author"	"14 October 2014"	"BackgroundThe one-step blending approach has been suggested for genomic prediction in dairy cattle. The core of this approach is to incorporate pedigree and phenotypic information of non-genotyped animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the improvement of the accuracy of genomic prediction using the one-step blending method in Chinese Holstein cattle.FindingsThree methods  GBLUP (genomic best linear unbiased prediction)  original one-step blending with a genomic relationship matrix  and adjusted one-step blending with an adjusted genomic relationship matrix  were compared with respect to the accuracy of genomic prediction for five milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. For the two one-step blending methods  de-regressed proofs of 17 509 non-genotyped cows  including 424 dams and 17 085 half-sisters of the validation cows  were incorporated in the prediction model. The results showed that  averaged over the five milk production traits  the one-step blending increased the accuracy of genomic prediction by about 0.12 compared to GBLUP. No further improvement in accuracies was obtained from the adjusted one-step blending over the original one-step blending in our situation.

The core of this approach is to incorporate pedigree and phenotypic information of non-genotyped animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the improvement of the accuracy of genomic prediction using the one-step blending method in Chinese Holstein cattle. Three methods  GBLUP (genomic best linear unbiased prediction)  original one-step blending with a genomic relationship matrix  and adjusted one-step blending with an adjusted genomic relationship matrix  were compared with respect to the accuracy of genomic prediction for five milk production traits in Chinese Holstein. For the two one-step blending methods  de-regressed proofs of 17 509 non-genotyped cows  including 424 dams and 17 085 half-sisters of the validation cows  were incorporated in the prediction model. The results showed that  averaged over the five milk production traits  the one-step blending increased the accuracy of genomic prediction by about 0.12 compared to GBLUP. No further improvement in accuracies was obtained from the adjusted one-step blending over the original one-step blending in our situation. Improvements in accuracies obtained with both one-step blending methods were almost completely contributed by the non-genotyped dams. Compared with GBLUP  the one-step blending approach can significantly improve the accuracy of genomic prediction for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. Thus  the one-step blending is a promising approach for practical genomic selection in Chinese Holstein cattle  where the reference population mainly consists of cows. A reference population with sufficient size is essential in genomic selection (GS) []-[]. For dairy cattle  in almost all countries with developed dairy industry  thousands of progeny-tested bulls with highly reliable estimated breeding value (EBV) are used to form the national reference population. However  constituting such a reference population is not feasible in some countries  e.g. China  where the number of bulls with highly reliable EBV is limited. As an alternative  cows can be used to form the reference population. Ding et al. [] investigated the accuracy of genomic prediction using a reference population consisting of cows  and showed that genomic selection using cows is feasible. However  a larger population of reference cows was required to obtain comparable accuracies of genomic prediction than when progeny-tested bulls are used as reference population  because cow EBV are generally less reliable than bull EBV []. Further efforts are needed to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction in such a situation. The term \"one-step blending\" was used to distinguish it from the original single-step approach using DPR (de-regressed proofs) instead of raw phenotypes []. In the present study  we investigated the possible improvements in the accuracy of genomic prediction by applying the one-step blending approach to Chinese Holsteins  for which the reference population consists primarily of cows. In addition  the influence of the relationship between the non-genotyped animals and genotyped selection candidates on the prediction accuracy of one-step blending was also investigated. The data consisted of 4917 Chinese Holstein cows born from 1998 to 2009 and 240 progeny-tested bulls born from 1984 to 2005  all of which had official EBV on five milk production traits (milk yield  fat yield  fat percentage  protein yield  and protein percentage). These official EBV were obtained based on a multiple-trait random regression test-day model []. DRP of all animals were derived from their EBV according to VanRaden and Wiggans [] and used as response variables for genomic prediction. Reliabilities of the DRP were calculated according to Liu et al. []. All animals had reliabilities of DRP greater than 0.40 (for cows) or 0.80 (for bulls). Out of the 4917 cows  4106 born before 2008  together with the 240 bulls  were taken as the reference population  and the remaining 811 cows born in or after 2008 were used as the validation population. All individuals in the reference and validation populations were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA). Missing genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with known chromosomal positions were imputed by BEAGLE []  and those with unknown chromosomal positions were discarded. After imputation  SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.01 were removed  leaving 46 422 SNPs for genomic prediction. To implement the one-step blending approach  all non-genotyped dams and half-sisters of the validation cows that had DRP with reliabilities greater than 0.40  were considered. Of the 811 validation cows  425 had non-genotyped dams (424 in total) and all had non-genotyped half-sisters (17 085 in total  ranging from 154 to 2672). Blood samples were collected from Chinese Holstein cattle when the regular quarantine inspection of the farms was conducted. The procedure for collecting the blood samples was carried out in strict accordance with the protocol approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of China Agricultural University (Permit Number: DK996). Three methods  GBLUP  the original one-step blending and the adjusted one-step blending  were implemented for genomic prediction of animals in the validation population. The following genomic BLUP model [] was used to predict genomic breeding values: where  is the vector of DRP of the reference animals   is the vector of additive genetic effects  which assumed to follows a normal distribution  with  being the genomic relationship matrix constructed using the first method of VanRaden []  and  is the vector of random errors  assumed to follow a normal distribution   with  being a diagonal matrix with  = 1/  where  ( is the reliability of DRP of individual ) [] []. The estimates in  based on this model are termed direct genomic breeding values (DGV). Following Legarra et al. []  Aguilar et al. []  and Christensen and Lund []  the one-step blending method has the same model as GBLUP  except that the vector  also contains the DRP of non-genotyped animals and vector  is assumed to follow a normal distribution   where  is defined as: with     and  sub-matrices of  (the pedigree-based relationship matrix)  and subscripts 1 and 2 refer to non-genotyped and genotyped animals  respectively. The estimates in  based on this model are termed the genomic enhanced breeding values (GEBV). To avoid the potential incompatibility in scale between the coefficients of  and  involved in the  matrix  which could lead to incorrect weighting of the pedigree and genomic information  as pointed out by Forni et al. []  the  matrix was adjusted following Gao et al. []  i.e.  where  and  are obtained from the following equations: Where Avg(diag(*)) means the average value of diagonal elements of matrix *; Avg(offdiag(*)) means the average value of non-diagonal elements of matrix *. The variance components  involved in the three models were estimated using AI-REML  as implemented in the software DMU []. The accuracy of genomic predictions was evaluated as []  where  is the correlation between the estimated  (DGV or GEBV) and the DRP in the validation population and r is the average of the square root of the reliability of the DRP of the validation cows. In addition  the theoretical accuracy of the DGV or GEBV was calculated for each individual in the same way as in conventional BLUP  following Henderson [] from the diagonal of the inverse of the mixed model equation (MME)  and the average theoretical accuracy over validation animals was also used to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions. As shown in Table   for the 811 validation cows  r and average theoretical accuracies from the original one-step blending increased by 0.12 and 0.02  respectively  compared with the accuracies from GBLUP averaged over the five traits. Accuracies from the adjusted one-step blending approach were almost the same as those from the original one-step blending. Theoretical accuracies were much higher than r  which was also observed in other studies [] []-[]. The theoretical accuracy may also be overestimated owing to sampling errors in elements of the genomic relationship matrix as pointed out by Goddard et al. []. In comparison with GBLUP  the one-step blending approach can significantly improve the accuracy of genomic prediction by incorporating the phenotypes (DRP) of non-genotyped relatives of the selection candidates. However  the adjusted one-step blending did not result in further improvements in accuracy compared with the original one-step blending  probably because the original  matrix was little adjusted in our situation  since the estimates of  and  were 0.992 (close to 1) and 0.017 (close to 0)  respectively  while they were 0.859 and 0.298 in the study of Christensen et al. []. Similar results were also observed by Gao et al. [] in the Nordic Holstein population  where the adjusted one-step blending resulted in little improvement in the prediction accuracy and estimates of  and  were 0.976 and 0.085  respectively. Among the 811 validation cows  425 had both non-genotyped dams and half-sisters  while 386 with genotyped dams had only non-genotyped half-sisters. For validation cows with genotyped dams   and the theoretical accuracies obtained from both one-step blending approaches were nearly the same as those from GBLUP (Table )  while for validation cows with both non-genotyped dams and half-sisters   were improved by 15 to 26 percentage points and 1 to 3 percentage points for the theoretical accuracy  when using the one-step blending approach (Table ). Again  in all these cases  the adjusted one-step blending did not perform better than the original one-step blending. These results suggest that  compared with GBLUP  improvements in accuracies from the one-step blending approach were almost completely contributed by the non-genotyped dams. To further prove this  we discarded all non-genotyped half-sisters and only included the non-genotyped dams of 425 validation cows in the one-step blending approach. As expected   and the theoretical accuracies of the 425 validation cows from the original one-step blending approach (Table ) were almost the same as those in the scenario when both non-genotyped dams and half-sisters were included in the one-step blending approach (Table ). The reason for this is that all non-genotyped half-sisters were daughters of 19 genotyped sires in the reference population and the information from these daughters was part of the DRP of the sires. Therefore  these half-sisters contributed little extra information for genomic prediction. Averaged over the five milk production traits  both one-step blending methods increased r and the average theoretical accuracy by about 0.12 and 0.02  respectively  compared to GBLUP. However  the adjusted one-step blending did not perform better than the original one-step blending in our situation. In our situation  improvements in accuracies from both one-step blending approaches were almost completely contributed by the non-genotyped dams of the validation animals.

Genomic information from dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips provides the opportunity to increase the rate of genetic progress in breeding programs  if a sufficient number of markers and animals with phenotypes (or pseudo-phenotypes such as estimated breeding values  EBV) are genotyped []. Because the cost of genotyping is high  alternative methods are necessary for cost-efficient genomic applications. A strategy that is used in dairy breeding programs is to genotype influential animals using a denser chip (e.g. Illumina® BovineSNP50 v2 - 50 K; Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) and selection candidates and cows using a lower-density chip (e.g. Illumina® BovineLD - 7 K) and then to impute (i.e. predict) missing genotypes from lower to higher density before calculating genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) []. This cost-effective strategy provides reliabilities of GEBV that are similar to those obtained if selection candidates were genotyped with the higher-density chip [] []. The Nelore (indicine) breed is the most important beef cattle breed in Brazil []. For this breed  the Illumina® BovineHD chip (HD) is used as the ¿gold standard¿ for research purposes  since a low level of linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers is observed in lower-density chips (e.g. 50 K) [] []. Profit margins from beef cattle operations are too low for the use of a HD chip at the commercial level. Thus  lower-density chips are required to overcome this limitation  which highlights the importance of assessing the accuracy of imputing genotypes in the Nelore breed. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of genotype imputation in Nelore cattle  using different imputation methods  different commercial and customized SNP chips and sets of animals whose genotypes were to be imputed. The importance of relatedness between validation and reference animals was also evaluated for the different chips and methods. Both sires and dams of the Nelore breed were genotyped. Sires that were widely used for artificial insemination were chosen as representative of the main Nelore breeding programs in Brazil. A total of 995 sires born between 1955 and 2008 were genotyped  spanning over 10 generations. A total of 1247 dams born between 1993 and 2008 were also genotyped. They included part of the genomic selection reference population of a commercial breeding program (DeltaGen) and were chosen among the dams that had the highest EBV accuracies for weaning  yearling and reproductive traits. Details about pedigree information of the genotyped animals are in Table . To evaluate the accuracy of genotype imputation  the animals were divided into reference and validation sets. The reference set comprised 793 sires that were born before 2005. Two separate validation sets were considered  including the animals most likely to have their genotypes imputed in practice: the first with the 202 younger sires and the second with the dams. Reference sets with different numbers of animals were not considered because the effect of size of the reference set on imputation accuracy is well documented in the literature e.g. [] []. Statistics on genomic relationships between reference and validation sets are in Table . The genomic relationship matrix () was defined as  = '/S2p(1-p)  in which  is the incidence matrix of markers whose elements in the i column are 0-2p  1-2p and 2-2p for genotypes AA  AB and BB  respectively  and p is the frequency of allele B at the i marker []. To compute   only the HD markers that passed quality control (described later) were used. As shown in Table   young sires were  compared to dams  more related (on average) to the reference sires  based on the maximum (Maxr) or the average of the top 10 (Mean10) genomic relationships of a given animal in the validation set with all animals in the reference set. All sires and dams were genotyped with the HD chip  which contains approximately 777 K SNPs. Animals from the validation set had their HD genotypes masked  except for the genotypes of markers present on the LD chip under evaluation  thus mimicking a situation in which these animals were genotyped with LD chips. Imputation from commercial LD panels to the HD chip was simulated by assuming that genotypes of animals from the validation set were available only for markers that were present on the HD and the following commercial chips: Illumina® BovineLD (7 K)  Illumina® BovineSNP50 v2 (50 K) and GeneSeek® Genomic Profiler 20 K and 75 K for indicine breeds (GGP20Ki and GGP75Ki  respectively). Eight customized (mimicked) 15 K LD chips were also tested  with varying densities and SNP selection criteria. Testing customized LD chips with less than 15 K SNPs was not relevant because their cost-effectiveness would not be attractive (Illumina®  personal communication). Using markers of the HD chip that passed quality control (see below)  four 15 K chips were simulated based on selection of one marker from each window of 29 subsequent markers  according to the UMD v3.1 assembly. For the first 15 K chip (15 K_e)  SNPs were evenly spaced by selecting the last marker from each window. For the second 15 K chip (15 K_em)  the SNP with the highest minor allele frequency (MAF) was selected from each window  and for the third chip (15 K_el)  the SNP with the highest average linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs from the same window was selected from each window. The r[] was adopted as the measure of linkage disequilibrium. In the fourth 15 K chip (15K_eml)  the SNP with the highest value for the product between its MAF and its average r with other SNPs from the same window was selected from each window. The remaining four customized LD chips were developed based on the add-on concept offered by Illumina®  where additional SNPs can be added to an existing commercial chip in a cost-effective way. The Illumina® Bovine LD chip (7 K) was used as the base chip. Additional SNPs were selected using the same criteria as used for the 15K_eml chip. Windows containing 39  25  16 and 9 subsequent markers were used to compose chips with densities around 18 K (11a7 K)  24 K (17a7 K)  34 K (27a7 K) and 55 K (48a7 K) markers. Quality control was performed for HD genotypes of the reference set  using the following criteria for excluding SNPs: (1) SNPs that were located in non-autosomal regions; (2) SNPs that had the same genomic coordinates  i.e. mapped to the same positions (just the replicates were removed); (3) SNPs with a p-value in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium z-test [] less than or equal to 10; (4) SNPs with a MAF less than 0.02; and (5) SNPs with a call rate per SNP less than 0.98 (genotypes with a GenCall score less than 0.70 were considered missing when computing this statistic). After these edits  439 595 SNPs remained. All samples from the reference set had a call rate per individual greater than 0.9 for SNPs passing quality control and were kept for the analyses. SNPs excluded from the reference set were also discarded from the validation sets  in addition to masking subsets of HD SNPs as previously described. For each LD chip  the numbers of SNPs that were shared with the HD chip before and after quality control are in Table . Imputation of genotypes from the LD chips to the HD chip was performed using the software packages BEAGLE v.3.3 [] and FImpute v.2.2 []. BEAGLE is a commonly used population-based imputation program (i.e. it does not rely on pedigree information) that adopts a stochastic procedure based on a Hidden Markov Monte-Carlo process to infer the probabilities of each haplotype/genotype. We used the most likely genotype as the predicted genotype. FImpute uses a family and population-based algorithm  or only the population-based algorithm  if pedigree information is not available  to deterministically phase the haplotypes and impute the missing genotypes. To evaluate the performance when considering family information in FImpute  we used both approaches  i.e. with or without pedigree information. Both programs were run with default parameters [] []. Considering the two sets of animals to be imputed (young sires and dams)  the 12 SNP chips to be tested (7 K  50 K  GGP20Ki  GGP75Ki  15K_e  15K_em  15K_el  15K_eml  11a7 K  17a7 K  27a7 K  48a7 K)  and the three methods (BEAGLE and FImpute considering or ignoring pedigree)  a complete factorial comparison would require 72 imputation analyses. As illustrated in Figure   only a subset of these analyses was carried out.  A reference set of 793 sires and a validation set with 202 young sires (sire:sire) or 1247 dams (sire:dam)  with (Ped) or without (Ped0) pedigree information and different lower-density chips; numbers in brackets correspond to the number given to the analysis. Analyses 1 to 12 were used to compare SNP chips. Results from analyses 13 to 16 were compared to those of their counterpart analyses (1  2  8 and 9  respectively) to evaluate the gain in accuracy when considering family information with FImpute. Results from analyses 17 to 23 were compared to those from analyses 1 to 4  8  9 and 12  to evaluate imputation accuracy when using different sets of animals to be imputed. Finally  analyses 24 to 29 and 30 to 35 were performed to infer accuracy of the imputed genotypes of Nelore young sires and dams using BEAGLE and different LD chips. Two criteria were used to assess imputation accuracy. The first was the percentage of correctly imputed genotypes (PERC). For incorrectly imputed genotypes  either one or both alleles can be imputed incorrectly. To distinguish between these two cases  the Pearson¿s correlation (CORR) between imputed and observed genotypes (coded as 0  1 or 2 copies of the B allele) was also computed  as in Hickey et al. []. Both PERC and CORR were calculated by individual and by SNP  for imputed SNPs only. Since both BEAGLE and FImpute imputed all missing genotypes  statistics on the proportion of imputed SNPs were not needed. The impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference animals on imputation accuracy was assessed by regressing CORR on the average of the top 10 genomic relationships between each animal in the validation set with all the animals in the reference set []. Results for CORR and PERC obtained with the different LD chips (analyses 1 to 12) are in Table . Values for PERC were proportionally smaller than the corresponding values for CORR since the penalty for one incorrectly imputed allele is relatively higher for PERC than for CORR. Since both measures provided comparable results  imputation accuracy will be presented and discussed in terms of CORR. Imputation accuracy was greater than 0.97 for all chips except for the 7 K chip. Considering the proportion of SNPs to be imputed (99.1%)  the imputation accuracy was high even for the 7 K chip. As documented in the literature [] []  imputation accuracy increases with a decreasing proportion of SNPs to be imputed. However  the gain in accuracy from the 11a7 K to the 48a7 K chip  for example  was small (0.0108) because the accuracy obtained with the 11a7 K chip was already high. Among the commercial chips  imputation accuracies with the 50 K and GGP20Ki chips were similar and outperformed that of the 7 K chip  while the GGP75Ki chip had the best accuracy. Among the virtual 15 K chips  selecting SNPs based on MAF (15K_em) rather than on linkage disequilibrium (15K_el)  in addition of being evenly spaced  tended to result in slightly higher imputation accuracies. The highest accuracy was observed when both criteria and even spacing were combined to define the SNP content of a virtual chip (15K_eml). However  the increase in accuracy was nominal compared to the 15K_e evenly spaced chip. Imputation accuracy of the 11a7 K chip was comparable to that of 15K_eml  with the potential benefit of the former being cheaper to be manufactured/acquired by adding SNPs on the existing 7 K chip. Although commercial and customized chips resulted in similar imputation accuracies  the customized chips that had the highest accuracies outperformed commercial chips with a similar density (after quality control). For instance  the average accuracy of the 15K_eml chip was 0.6% and 0.7% higher than those of the 50 K and GGP20Ki chips  respectively. Results of FImpute analyses with and without pedigree information are in Table . For the 50 K  15K_eml and 11a7 K chips  there was no benefit from using pedigree information and for the 7 K chip  the gain in accuracy was marginal (+1%). These low gains in accuracy are in part due to the low quality of the available pedigree information  since the sire was unknown for a proportion (38%) of the genotyped animals from the validation set  but also because FImpute assumes that all animals are to some degree related when performing population imputation  by searching for common haplotypes shared by individuals []. Imputation accuracy was lower for dams than for young sires  especially for lower density chips (Table ). For instance  the difference in accuracy between young sires and dams was 5.0% for the 7 K chip and 0.7% for the 48a7 K chip. As a consequence  the increase in accuracy for dams was more pronounced as the proportion of SNPs to be imputed decreased. This result is due to the fact that the young sires were  on average  more related to the reference sires than the dams (Table ). This effect of relatedness on imputation accuracy will be discussed in more detail below. FImpute outperformed BEAGLE for the different chips and validation sets in terms of average accuracy (Table ). The greatest difference was observed for the validation set of dams and the 7 K chip  for which the average accuracy of FImpute was 3.4% higher than that of BEAGLE. The average differences in accuracy between FImpute and BEAGLE were more pronounced for dams (1.5 to 3.4%) than for young sires (0.7 to 3.1%). For both validation sets  differences between imputation methods tended to be higher at lower densities. BEAGLE also presented  for all chips  minimum accuracy values that were lower than those of FImpute. The minimum accuracies obtained with BEAGLE were on average 4.6% and 4.7% lower for young sires and dams  respectively  than the minimum accuracies for the corresponding FImpute analyses. The impact of relatedness between validation and reference animals on imputation accuracy is illustrated in Figure . For the purpose of clarity  only results of four representative analyses (17 and 30; 23 and 35) are presented. The impact of relatedness to the reference set on accuracy was more evident for lower (7 K) than for higher density (48a7 K) chips. Imputation accuracies tended to be higher as the relatedness between imputed and reference animals increased. This tendency was stronger for FImpute than for BEAGLE with the 7 K chip and was similar  on average  between both software in the 48a7 K chip. For below average levels of relatedness  the dispersion of imputation accuracies was higher for BEAGLE than for FImpute  notably for the 48a7 K chip.  Figure 2 shows the results from the imputation analyses using dams as the validation set and the 7 K (top) or 48a7 K (bottom) chip. Solid lines refer to second order polynomial (top) and linear (bottom) regressions. Although imputation accuracy was in general high  SNP-wise imputation accuracy is relevant also. For brevity  only the result of analysis 9 for bovine autosome 1 is presented in Figure . As previously reported in the literature for other cattle breeds [] []  some regions of the genome had very low imputation accuracy (CORR < 0.60). A more careful analysis revealed that these regions had markers with very low levels of linkage disequilibrium with neighboring markers (Figure )  which suggests potential mapping or assembly issues in the reference genome. Comparatively  BEAGLE and FImpute had low imputation accuracy for the same genomic regions (data not shown). Markers of these regions were removed in an attempt to increase imputation accuracy of the markers from the surrounding regions  but no improvements on imputation accuracy were obtained  possibly because the proportion of discarded markers was small and the imputation accuracies were already high in the neighboring regions (data not shown).  Top: SNP-wise correlation between imputed and observed genotypes (CORR) is plotted against the genomic coordinates (in Mb) for SNPs located on chromosome 1  which was divided in windows of about 50 subsequent markers; windows with the lowest  and highest  average imputation accuracies are highlighted. Middle: Heatmap representing the extent of linkage disequilibrium (r) in window A (51 markers located between 44.71 and 44.91 Mb; averages for accuracy  MAF and r were 0.390  0.195 and 0.103  respectively). Bottom: Heatmap representing the extent of r in window B (48 markers located between 69.40 and 69.49 Mb; averages for accuracy  MAF and r were 1.000  0.270 and 0.321  respectively). *In order to exemplify the amount of variation verified for SNP-wise imputation accuracy on a single chromosome  the results obtained from Analysis 9 (Figure ) are presented (i.e. using the 11a7k chip and FImpute considering pedigree information to impute genotypes of young sires). Imputation methods rely partially on linkage disequilibrium between markers to infer unobserved genotypes. The Nelore breed has lower levels of linkage disequilibrium at short distances than taurine breeds [] []. Nevertheless  the imputation accuracies obtained in this study are comparable to accuracies reported in the literature for taurine breeds []-[]. For instance  Ma et al. [] imputed genotypes from the 50 K to the HD chip in a population of Swedish and Finnish Red cattle and found similar accuracies (around 0.97) to those reported here. As documented in the literature e.g. [] [] []  imputation accuracy increased with increasing density of the LD chip. Increasing the density of the LD chip from 7 K to 15 K resulted in a greater increase in imputation accuracy than an increase in density from 15 K to 75 K  because imputation accuracy was already high (>0.97) for the 15 K chip. This result is consistent  for example  with those of Khatkar et al. [] who reported on the imputation of 50 K genotypes of Australian Holstein-Friesian cattle and observed a relatively greater increase in imputation accuracy when the density of the LD chip increased from 3 K to 7 K than from 7 K to 10 K. Imputation accuracy has a large influence on the reliability of genomic predictions [] [] []. Mulder et al. [] derived a deterministic equation to predict the accuracy of GEBV based on imputation accuracy (measured as a correlation) and observed that it increased linearly with increasing imputation correlation. Daetwyler et al. [] suggested that the decline in accuracy of GEBV was actually slightly lower than the decline in accuracy of imputation. In a scenario with low-density genotypes (14 SNPs/Morgan)  these authors observed that 87.8% of missing genotypes were correctly imputed but 95% of the accuracy of GEBV obtained with high-density SNP genotypes (1500 SNPs/Morgan) was achieved. Although reliability of GEBV was not evaluated in the present study  it is plausible to assume that the reliability of GEBV of Nelore cattle based on imputed genotypes from a chip with approximately 15 K SNPs  for which the imputation accuracy was around 0.98  would be similar to that of GEBV obtained with the HD chip. Nevertheless  a more thorough analysis on this subject is needed. Different (mimicked) customized LD chips were tested in order to evaluate changes in imputation accuracy when criteria for SNP selection were modified. As in Mulder et al. []  selecting SNPs based on MAF (15K_em) and even spacing across the genome had little impact on imputation accuracy compared to selecting SNPs based only on even spacing. A small favorable difference was observed when SNPs were selected based on MAF (15K_em) rather than on linkage disequilibrium (15K_el)  in addition to being evenly spaced. A slightly better accuracy was observed when both criteria (MAF and linkage disequilibrium)  in addition to even spacing  were combined to select the SNPs for the chip (15K_eml). Increasing SNP density in the telomere regions of the chromosomes is expected to further increase the imputation performance of the customized chips []. We did not use refined algorithms to optimize the imputation accuracy of the customized chips since the development of an LD chip was outside the scope of our study. Results obtained with the 11a7 K chip suggests that if a new optimized LD chip was to be developed  adding SNPs to the existing commercial 7 K chip would be a good strategy since this would be less costly and provide an imputation accuracy that is comparable to that of a completely customized chip with similar density. The customized chips that showed the highest imputation accuracy slightly outperformed the commercial chips with an equivalent density. It is important to mention that commercial and customized chips cannot be properly compared  since the design of the customized chips used information on genotypes from the same population than that to be imputed. However  it does highlight the importance of using population-specific information to design LD chips. Imputation accuracy was not as much affected by pedigree information as by using different imputation methods. FImpute resulted in higher imputation accuracies for the different chips and validation sets than BEAGLE. Ma et al. [] found that FImpute slightly outperformed BEAGLE when imputing Swedish and Finnish Red cattle genotypes from 50 K to HD  but BEAGLE outperformed FImpute when imputing from 3 K to 50 K. Sun et al. [] also observed a slightly better imputation performance of BEAGLE compared to FImpute when imputing Angus genotypes from 7 K to 50 K. These results indicate that the choice of the imputation method depends on the chip and population  i.e. there is no single method that provides higher imputation accuracy for all scenarios. However  an outstanding advantage of FImpute over BEAGLE is its computational efficiency. As reported by Ma et al. []  processing time of the analysis with FImpute was much shorter than with BEAGLE (data not shown). Another factor that influenced imputation accuracy was the level of relatedness between imputed and reference animals. In agreement with the literature [] [] [] []  imputation accuracy tended to increase as the relatedness between imputed and reference animals increased for both imputation methods. The influence of relatedness on imputation accuracy decreased with increasing SNP density of the LD chip. For the Nelore cattle population  using the denser LD chips (GGP75Ki and 48a7 K) resulted in high accuracies (>0.90) with FImpute even for animals that were poorly related to the reference set. For some genomic applications (e.g. genome-wide association (GWA) studies)  SNP-wise imputation accuracy is relevant to prevent the propagation of genotyping errors. As in Erbe et al. [] and VanRaden et al. []  some regions of the genome contained markers that presented an erratic pattern of linkage disequilibrium  which suggests potential mapping and reference genome assembly problems. These regions had a negligible effect on imputation accuracy by individual but can potentially affect GWA studies. While the origin of this erratic linkage disequilibrium pattern is unknown  a precautious strategy would be to exclude markers from these regions as a quality control criterion for GWA studies. To facilitate this  a supplementary table [See Additional file : Table S1] summarizes all the observed regions that presented poor imputation performance. Finally  it is not clear if the Illumina® BovineHD chip should be considered as the target high-density chip for genomic applications in the Nelore breed. Recent genomic prediction results (not published) have revealed that the 50 K and HD chips share similar predictive abilities for different traits in Nelore cattle. At present  it is not clear to what extent the size and composition of the reference population influence these results. As reported by VanRaden et al. []  the benefit of using denser chips for genomic prediction becomes more evident as the reference population increases. Denser chips are also preferred for genomic applications that aim at identifying and subsequently using information from causal mutations [] []. Except for the most valuable breeding stock (e.g. influential sires and potential donor cows)  genotyping the animals with dense chips is prohibitive for most beef cattle operations. Thus  genotyping strategies need to be further investigated to allow the incorporation of genomic information in beef cattle breeding programs in a cost-effective way. The results presented here show that a strategy of genotyping dams and young sire candidates with LD chips to predict missing HD genotypes by imputation is feasible. Future studies are needed to better identify the proper densities of genotyping chips to be used for each category of animals and in which proportion they should be genotyped for each application. Our results indicate that if the HD chip is considered as the target chip for genomic applications in the Nelore breed  cost-effectiveness can be improved by genotyping part of the economically marginal animals with an LD chip that contains around 15 K useful SNPs and imputing the missing HD genotypes. A denser LD chip (50 K useful SNPs) is recommended for animals that are poorly related to the reference population. For the current Nelore population  FImpute is preferred over BEAGLE for imputation of missing genotypes. JFG and TSS conceived the study and JFG led its coordination.

Compared to    resulted in more accurate GEBV predictions. With the development of high-throughput genotyping technologies and the reduction of genotyping costs  genomic selection (GS) has become a practical and effective tool for animal and plant breeding [] []. In genomic selection []  markers that densely cover the genome are expected to be in complete or partial population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the QTL (quantitative trait loci)  which allows a high fraction of the genetic variance to be explained by the markers []. The population-wide LD information can be approximated by a relationship matrix based on identity by-state (IBS) ( matrix)  where the relationships are reflected by the actual proportion of shared marker alleles that are IBS  as a deviation from expected IBS allele sharing in the population. With an animal model similar to the classical mixed model  best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of the GEBV can be achieved by replacing the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix with the  matrix (G-BLUP) [] []. Habier et al. [] and Luan et al. [] found that  although genomic prediction based on IBS information does not in principle require pedigree data  it does use the family structure of the population  since the markers capture the LD that arises from the family structure. This LD allows close genetic relationships between animals within the pedigree  which are explained by linkage analysis (LA). Fernando and Grossman [] reported a genomic identity-by-descent (IBD) matrix ( matrix) that contains IBD probabilities within a known pedigree and that depicts this LA information. Thus  based on a limited number of generations within the known pedigree  GEBV can be predicted using the  matrix []. For genomic prediction based on the  matrix  marker alleles are IBD if they can be traced back to common ancestors in a clearly defined base generation. The probability of IBD is based only on pedigree information and the inheritance of marker alleles is traced within the pedigree. For genomic prediction based on the  matrix  it is not possible to identify whether IBS marker alleles are IBD or not  since there is no defined base generation  which means that the  matrix potentially depicts non-recorded relationships that occurred before the base generation of the known pedigree. Thus  a key difference between the  and  matrices is the number of generations they take into consideration. For the  matrix  this is limited by the age of the SNPs used  whereas estimates of IBD coefficients with the  matrix are based only on the known pedigree  and founders are considered to be unrelated. Because of selection  mutations that cause genetic variation in the trait of interest may be considerably younger than the mutations that underlie SNPs on the SNP chip that have a high minor allele frequency (MAF)  which may be very old since they drifted to high MAF. Moreover  the  matrix may focus on too few generations []. Hence  in this work  we developed a relationship matrix    based on runs of homozygosity (ROH)  which considers a range of relationship ages that is between that considered by  and . For   IBD probabilities are calculated using a multi-locus measure of LD called ROH or haplotype homozygosity []. ROH is defined as the probability that all consecutive markers on a pair of homologous chromosome segments  in the same or different individual(s)  have identical alleles  which indicates IBD []. The probability of IBD can be calculated from the distribution of the length of homozygous chromosome segments that surround an IBD locus  since the mean of this length is approximately (log  – 1)/2   where  is the effective population size []. Hayes et al. [] found that ROH over long distances reflects recent   whereas ROH over small distances reflects the  in the more distant past. ROH can be used to measure multi-locus LD between a marker and a QTL. Compared to two-locus measures of LD such as   a major advantage of ROH is that it is generally a less variable indicator of IBD than   since the latter is known to be very variable []. The variability of LD measured by ROH decreases as the marker density increases  whereas variability of LD based on  is unaffected by the number of markers []. In this paper  we propose a novel method to predict GEBV based on ROH  hereafter referred to as . Using simulated datasets with various thresholds of MAF for markers and QTL  we compared the accuracy of GEBV prediction using  based on (population-wide) LD  and  based on linkage analysis. In addition  we evaluated the accuracy of prediction of these methods using real data of deregressed EBV of 1086 Italian Brown Swiss bulls. A forward simulator () was used to simulate populations according to Wright’s ideal population model  i.e. with random mating  uniform mutation rate and base pair position  drift/mutation balance  manageable effective size  SNP mutations that are accumulated through generations of spontaneous mutations and recombinations under random mating. The ideal populations had an effective size of 500  a 1:1 sex ratio and a mutation rate of 10 per base pair per meiosis. To maintain a reasonable computation time  only one chromosome of length 1 Morgan was simulated. After 10 000 generations of random mating  the genotypes of the newly produced individuals  referred to as generation 0  were recorded. Genotypes for two kinds of pedigrees were created with generation 0  and were used to produce two simulated datasets i.e. Data I and Data II. Data I was based on a sampled pedigree that was based on 25 sires randomly sampled from the previous generation that were randomly mated to 250 dams randomly sampled from the same generation. Each dam had two offspring. This procedure was repeated for eight generations. Genotypes of the last five generations were recorded to form the simulated dataset. The simulation was performed 10 times to obtain 10 replicates of Data I. For Data II  the genotypes after 10 000 generations of random mating were gene-dropped through a real pedigree of the Italian Brown Swiss population. The population consisted of 11 599 animals  including 3626 founders and their offspring. There were 27 generations in the pedigree. Genotypes simulated for generation 0 were diffused into this pedigree through its founders. The simulated genotypes of the individuals that were genotyped in the real data were recorded to obtain Data II. This simulation was also performed 10 times to obtain 10 replicates. One thousand SNPs per chromosome and 30 QTL were sampled disjointedly (i.e. QTL loci could not be sampled as marker loci) from the genotypes created above. Five sampling strategies were used according to the SNP allele frequencies to obtain the following five populations in each dataset (Data I and Data II): Population 1 consisted of randomly sampled markers and QTL (MAF > 0  MAF > 0); Population 2 consisted of markers all sampled with a minimum MAF of 0.1 and QTL with a maximum MAF of 0.1 (MAF > 0.1  MAF < 0.1); Population 3 consisted of markers with a minimum MAF of 0.1 and QTL sampled at random (MAF > 0.1  MAF > 0); Population 4 consisted of markers sampled at random and QTL sampled with a maximum MAF of 0.1 (MAF > 0  MAF < 0.1); Population 5 consisted of markers with a minimum MAF of 0.15 and QTL sampled with a maximum MAF of 0.05 (MAF > 0.15  MAF < 0.05). These five populations reflect the varying degrees to which SNPs can be selected for inclusion on the SNP chip based on high MAF and the variable low frequency of QTL due to selection. The simulated QTL effects were additive and followed a Laplacian distribution with mean 0 and shape parameter 1. The phenotypes were finally simulated by adding random environmental effects that were independently  identically and normally distributed  in order to achieve a heritability of 0.10. The real data on 1086 Italian Brown Swiss bulls consisted of genotyping (i.e. 35 706 SNPs) and phenotyping data i.e. de-regressed proofs (DP) for three traits: milk yield (kg)  milk fat yield (kg) and milk protein yield (kg). A detailed description of these data is reported in Luan et al. []. To obtain the cross-validation datasets  the phenotypes of a defined number of individuals were masked. For the simulated data  in Data I we randomly selected 500 of 4500 individuals at a time for each replicate  without replacement  to produce nine non-overlapping cross-validation datasets  i.e.  every phenotype was masked once. Therefore  a total of 90 cross-validation datasets were produced for 10 replicates. Similarly  in Data II we randomly selected 181 of 1086 individuals at a time to produce six non-overlapping cross-validation datasets for each replicate  resulting in 60 datasets. The GEBV of the masked individuals were predicted by the genomic prediction methods described in the next section. The correlation coefficient between the GEBV and true breeding values (TBV) was calculated and used as a measure of the GEBV prediction accuracy  and the deviation of the coefficient of regression of TBV on GEBV from 1 was used as a measure of bias. The mean and standard error of the prediction accuracies and biases in the 90 and 60 datasets for Data I and Data II  respectively  were calculated for each population and each prediction method. For the analysis with real data on 1086 Italian Brown Swiss bulls  two strategies were used to produce cross-validation datasets. The first strategy was the same as that applied to Data II  except that the GEBV were correlated to the masked DP  to obtain a measure of the accuracy of the GEBV (this measure does not have a maximum of 1 since the reliability of the DP is less than 100%). To obtain standard errors  the division into sets and GEBV predictions were replicated 10 times. The second strategy consisted of selecting the youngest bulls as the validation dataset. In practice  to obtain a validation dataset of reasonable size  we selected bulls born in the three most recent years in the pedigree (2003  2004 and 2005). One hundred and sixteen young bulls were selected  and their GEBV were predicted using data on 970 older animals. A run of homozygosity is defined as two haplotypes carrying IBS marker alleles from some position i through to some position j. Let ROH(i j) denote the probability of this occurring (without making any assumptions about marker identity at the border positions (i-1) and (j + 1)). The method to calculate ROH(i j) was described in detail by Macleod et al. []. Briefly  it calculates the probability that no mutation at the marker positions has occurred since the two homologous chromosome segments coalesced into a common ancestor  integrated over all possible coalescence times. The calculations also account for the fact that the segment between markers i and j may consist of a combination of several shorter IBD segments that each coalesced into different common ancestors. The calculations require knowledge on the genetic distances between the markers  their mutation rates  and the effective population size ()  which was assumed to be 100. An approximate estimate for the mutation rate at the markers  m  is obtained by equating the average homozygosity of all markers to its expected value 1/(1 + 4m). Here  we will also consider run of homozygosity probability ROH(i k j)  where a putative focal position k which is in the middle between two consecutive markers forming a marker bracket  is also assumed to be IBS (with i < k < j). Since the focal position k is in the middle between two markers  there is no actual marker data at this position. Thus  ROH(i j) is the sum of the probability ROH(i k j) and the probability that all positions except position k carry IBS alleles. Let ROH(-i -j) denote the probability that all marker alleles between positions i and j are IBS between two haplotypes  but the haplotypes are not IBS at positions (i-1) and (j + 1) (for ROH  we usually observe that all markers between positions i and j are IBS but that IBS does not extend beyond the boundaries i and j). Bounded ROH probabilities can be calculated from unbounded ROH(i j) probabilities as []: Inclusion of an extra position k among the IBS markers is straightforward: Now  given that we know that all actual markers are IBS between positions i and j and not IBS at positions (i-1) and (j + 1)  the IBD probability at position k is defined as the probability that there has been no mutation at this position since its coalescence: Here  we need to make an (arbitrary) assumption about the mutation rate at position k (m)  which is chosen such that the a priori IBD probability at position k is close to 0.5  i.e. 1/(1 + 4m) ˜ 0.5  in order to give the marker data ample opportunity to change the a priori probability either towards 0 (few or no IBS markers in the vicinity of k) or towards 1 (k is in the middle of a long stretch of IBS markers). IBD probability PIBD(k|-i -j) is calculated and averaged over all marker brackets in the genome  with the focal position k in the middle of each bracket. The averaged PIBD(k|-i -j) of all combinations of genotyped animals are stored in a ROH-based relationship matrix  called .  is not always positive definite  because its elements are calculated on a one-by-one basis. Therefore  the eigenvalues of  are checked  negative eigenvalues are set to 0  and the matrix is reconstructed using only the positive eigenvalues. Finally  a small value (0.0001) is added to the diagonals to make  positive definite. The calculation of PIBD(k|-i -j) and  is implemented in the LDMIP software () []. Program LDMIP can also use the PIBD(k|-i -j) probabilities for imputation of missing marker data  i.e. it finds the N haplotypes that resemble the haplotype with a missing marker based on the highest PIBD probability at every position k. Next  it uses the Viterbi algorithm [] to find  for the current haplotype  a path through these N haplotypes without mismatches between the current and the proposed haplotype and with the fewest number of switches between the N haplotypes. I.e.  the algorithm finds a mosaic of the N haplotypes that most closely resembles the current haplotype  and uses this mosaic to impute the missing markers. Because marker phase is often unknown (i.e. a heterozygous genotype is not known to be `1 2’ or `2 1’)  the Viterbi algorithm is actually applied to resolve both haplotypes of an individual simultaneously  resulting in a mosaic (as explained above) for each of the two haplotypes and resolving the phase of heterozygous genotypes (`1 2’ or `2 1’). For this  the Viterbi algorithm considers N combinations of the N haplotypes that were selected based on PIBD. Based on some preliminary testing  we found N = 40 as a suitable tradeoff between accuracy and computing time. The LDMIP algorithm also yields probabilities of paternal and maternal inheritance at the marker alleles for all animals in the pedigree []  which can be used to set up a linkage analysis based on the genomic relationship matrix  by setting up such a relationship matrix at all marker positions and averaging across positions [] []. The model used to predict GEBV with IBS  LA and ROH information can be expressed as: where  is a vector of phenotypes (DP) for a trait;  is the overall mean;  is a design matrix linking the animals to the phenotypes;  is a vector of additive genetic effects of the animals and  is the vector of random residuals. It is assumed that  ~  (  ) where (.) refers to ROH  LA or IBS and  is the additive genetic variance associated with . For GEBV prediction based on IBS relationships   is . Two ways to set up the  matrix were used here. The first was to construct the  matrix with standardized marker genotypes () as  =    where  is the number of markers and  is a matrix of the standardized marker genotypes    where  is the genotype of animal  for SNP   with  = 0  1 or 2 for genotypes “0 0”  “1 0” or “1 1”  respectively  and  is the frequency of allele 1 of SNP . Standardization is such that the mean and the variance of  are 0 and 1  respectively []. The second method used to construct the  matrix was as in VanRaden []  where markers are not standardized and the IBS matrix is calculated as  = ’/S(2(1 - )  where  is a matrix of non-standardized marker genotypes  i.e. . For GEBV prediction based on LA relationships   is   the LA-based genomic IBD relationship matrix. For a detailed description about models for GEBV prediction based on LA relationships  see Luan et al. []. For GEBV prediction based on ROH relationships   is   the ROH-based genomic IBD relationship matrix. To implement the models       and  were inverted and were then used in ASReml [] to predict GEBV of both phenotyped and non-phenotyped individuals. We evaluated the accuracy and bias of the GEBV obtained by  in 90 simulated datasets of Data I and in 60 datasets of Data II and compared them with GEBV based on    and  relationship matrices. Means and standard errors of the accuracies and biases of the GEBV are in Tables  and  for Data I and II  respectively. For all datasets  accuracy of the GEBV was higher with  than with    and   although the differences were not always statistically significant. Accuracies of GEBV based on  and  were similar. Accuracies of GEBV were higher and biases lower with Data I (Table ) than with Data II (Table )  which is expected since the size of the reference population was larger in Data I (4000 individuals) than in Data II (905 individuals). It is also notable that the presence of rare QTL alleles reduced the accuracy much more with real pedigree structures (Data II) than with random pedigrees (Data I). For the simulated dataset with a random pedigree (Data I)  accuracies were higher with  than with  for all QTL allele frequency scenarios (Table ). For the simulated dataset with real pedigree (Data II)  accuracies were also higher with  than with  when a maximum MAF was applied to the QTL but were lower when QTL were randomly sampled (Table ). Results from simulations (Tables  and ) demonstrated that the accuracy of GEBV was affected by the MAF of markers and QTL. The highest accuracy was obtained in the population with a minimum MAF of 0.1 for markers and no MAF threshold applied to QTL. Application of a maximum MAF threshold to QTL appeared to reduce the accuracy of GEBV. For example  for GEBV using   the accuracies decreased by ~38% and ~11% when QTL had a MAF below 0.1 in Data I and Data II  respectively  compared to when both QTL and SNPs were randomly sampled. When a minimum MAF was applied to markers and a maximum MAF to QTL  accuracies of GEBV were reduced. To investigate the performance of the -based method in practice  we applied  to real DP datasets of 1086 Italian Brown Swiss bulls for fat yield  milk yield and protein yield. Table  presents the correlations between GEBV and DP and biases of GEBV with    and   since the TBV is unknown in the real dataset. The bias was calculated as the regression of DP on GEBV. However  it should be noted here that any under- or over-scaling of the DP by the deregression process will appear as regression coefficients that deviate from 1  i.e. as bias []. Table  shows that the correlations obtained with  were higher than those with  and very similar to those with  but with a substantially lower regression coefficient. In agreement with results from the simulated data  the  and -based methods resulted in similar correlations and biases. The correlation obtained for protein yield was higher than that for fat and milk yields. The standard error of the correlations obtained with the -based method was smaller than that of the other methods  which indicates that the results were less variable. This is in line with the expectation of Hayes et al. [] that multi-locus measures of LD are less variable. Correlations between GEBV and DP and biases of GEBV obtained when    and  were used to predict the group of 116 young bulls are in Table . In contrast to the analyses with randomly selected cross-validation bulls  GEBV prediction for the group of young bulls was performed only once and thus no standard errors were available. The correlation between GEBV and DP was higher with  than with  and  (Table ). Also  the -based method resulted in slightly higher correlations than the -based method. Figures  and  show the scatter-plots of 1086 diagonal and 589 156 off-diagonal entries of    and  versus the  matrix for the real data. Regression lines of the entries of    and  matrix on those of the  matrix are also shown in these figures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In this study  we proposed -based genomic prediction  a novel method to compute GEBV based on runs of homozygosity. Runs of homozygosity yield a multi-locus measure of LD  from which a measure of IBD is derived  which we expected to be less variable than the IBD derived by single-locus measures of LD and thus to result in an increased accuracy of GEBV. Using simulated and real data  the accuracy and bias of GEBV based on  were compared to those based on  and . Results from simulation analyses showed that  in general   resulted in more accurate GEBV  up to 4% points higher. With the real data  the accuracy of GEBV was higher with  than with  but only slightly higher than with . Predictions using  and  especially   were less affected by the difference in allele frequencies between QTL and markers  probably because they do not rely on pair-wise LD between QTL and markers. A possible explanation of the difference in results between real and simulated data may lie in the difference in the population structures in the datasets. In the real dataset  we found that recent family relationships are strong in the population of bulls used []. Thus  in the real data  older and more distant relationships may contribute little to the accuracy of GEBV. This favors   which relies on recent family relationships to predict GEBV  whereas  relies on more distant relationships and hence yielded lower accuracies than  for the real data. Matrix  captures relationships that span a range of ages of relationships that is intermediate between those captured by  and . Matrix  also takes recent family relationships much more in account and resulted in accuracies of GEBV that were as high as with  for the real data. In simulated data based on a sampled pedigree (Data I)  the older and more distant relationships contributed more to the accuracy of GEBV  which favors  and thus the accuracy obtained with  was higher than with  for Data I. For the simulated data based on the real pedigree from the population with strong recent family relationships (Data II)  the results in Table  show that the performance of  and  depended on the simulation scenario. If QTL were randomly sampled  the older and more distant relationships were important because this scenario allows old QTL mutations to still contribute to the genetic variance. Matrix  can capture such relationships and hence achieved higher accuracy than  for that scenario. If QTL were sampled with a maximum threshold of MAF  then mainly recent QTL mutations contribute to the genetic variance. This implies that recent family relationships are important for the accuracy of GEBV and that more distant relationships contribute little  as indicated by the fact that  achieved higher accuracy than  for this scenario (Table ). In the simulation results   achieved higher accuracies than  and  in all cases. In cases where older and more distant relationships are important (Table  and MAF> 0 in Table )   can capture such relationships and  therefore  achieved higher accuracies than . However  the capacity of  to capture information on old relationships depends on the use of uncertain relationships between ancestors  which may undermine the performance of . In contrast   does not look back as many generations as  and thus yields higher accuracies than . In cases where recent family relationships are important (QTL sampled with a MAF threshold in Table )   achieved higher accuracies than . The capacity of  to capture non-recorded relationships before the base generation of the known pedigree means that  can use such information and thus achieve higher accuracies than . The latter would be especially useful for across-breed prediction  as in the case when the training population contains several breeds. Thus  it appears that our novel method  can benefit from the favorable properties of both  and . The relationship matrices used in this study differ in the chromosomal distance they consider. Matrix  can consider a distance up to one complete chromosome  while  relies on pair-wise LD between markers and QTL  which stretches only over small chromosomal distances. Matrix  uses multi-locus LD and thus can account for larger chromosomal distances to capture LD than . Matrix  seems to strike a balance between short and long range LD and resulted in the highest prediction accuracies for a range of situations  except for prediction of the youngest animals in the data set  which is however a typical scenario for genomic selection in practice. Similar to the way both marker and pedigree information are used in matrix   Goddard et al. [] proposed a method to obtain an unbiased estimate of relationships for genomic prediction by regressing the IBS matrix onto the pedigree-based relationship matrix. Their method uses the relationship matrix  for genomic prediction  where  is the relationship matrix based on pedigree  and the regression coefficient  reflects the proportion of genetic variance explained by the markers. This method attempts to take the whole range of population structures into consideration: matrix  accounts for recent relationships and matrix  for distant relationships. Therefore  when recent family relationships are more important  use of matrix  may yield higher accuracies than use of . The regression coefficient  depends on marker density and putative differences in the properties of markers vs. QTL. If QTL and markers do not systematically differ  for example markers and QTL are randomly sampled  as explored in this study   can be predicted from the marker data. If QTL and markers differ systematically (e.g. MAF> 0.15 and MAF < 0.05 in this study)  the regression coefficient  should be estimated from the data  which can be achieved by fitting the  and  matrices jointly in a variance component estimation model. Accuracies were lower for prediction of young animals than for random cross-validation datasets. This may be due to the fact that the Mendelian sampling component of their TBV  i.e. about half of the total variance of the TBV  is uncorrelated to any of the training records. The results for the group of young animals in the real data show that the highest accuracy was obtained with   followed by  and . A possible explanation may be that the three methods capture different relationship ages. Matrix  only focuses on the known pedigree  for which the relationships of young animals can be well-defined. With   uncertain relationships between ancestors prior to the known pedigree may deteriorate the ability to capture relationships between young animals. Matrix  captures information on relationships for ages that are intermediate between those of  and   and thus achieves an intermediate accuracy. The performance of the methods also depends on the effective size of the population (). If  is small  common ancestors tend to be in the recent past and recent family relationships tend to dominate the population structure. It is expected that  performs better than . If  is large  distant family relationships occur frequently and the performance of  deteriorates. Thus  it is expected that  will perform worse than  in a population with a large  and when the training population consists of a mixture of different breeds. In the analysis with real data   was found to give higher accuracies than   while in the simulation study with  = 500   performed better. This suggests that the Italian Brown Swiss bull population has a smaller  than 500  which is also suggested by its small number of sires (21). Goddard et al. [] pointed out that variation in relationships between animals in a population increases with . Thus   is expected to result in higher accuracies of prediction than  when variation in relationships is small  such as between breeds. In the simulation study  we used two methods to calculate the matrix   which differed in whether markers were standardized or not prior to its calculation. It is known that standardizing markers increases the weight placed on low MAF markers []. The effects of markers with low MAF are estimated with much lower accuracy. This suggests that the standardization of markers may result in different accuracies. However  our results show that the two methods of computing  resulted in similar accuracies. This agrees with the expectation of Sonesson et al. []. The simulated and real data results were quite different even when the real pedigree was used in the simulations. The changes in allele frequencies between markers and QTL introduced in Table  did not result in simulated results being closer to the real data results of Table . Possibly  in the real data  the QTL do not have a MAF as low as that simulated in Table  because they have been recently selected and the population has high rates of inbreeding  which causes low allele frequencies to drift towards intermediate values. It seems that LA information was much more important for the analysis of real data than that of simulated data. A possible explanation is the much higher reliability of the deregressed proofs compared to that of the simulated trait (h = 0.1)  which also resulted in the higher cross-validation accuracies in the real data. This high reliability of the de-regressed proofs resulted in accurate estimation of chromosomal segments in the linkage analysis  while the low heritability of the simulated trait implies that the long-term  LD-based genetic effects also need to be estimated to achieve high cross-validation accuracy. The present study proposes a novel method    to predict GEBV based on runs of homozygosity. Through computer simulations  we showed that the accuracy of GEBV was higher with  than with  and . In the analyses of real data  accuracies obtained with  and  were similar and for the youngest animals  they were highest with . The accuracies obtained with the LD matrix calculated with or without standardizing marker genotypes were similar. TL performed the study and drafted the manuscript.

The individual imputation accuracy depended mainly on the applied software and the level of admixture. Rapid innovations in high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have drastically reduced the costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) []  which has made it feasible to re-sequence a large fraction of any mammalian genome. However  sequencing thousands of individuals is still too costly for routine implementation in breeding programs. To date  50 k SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-chips typically build the genetic resource for genomic predictions and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in livestock and other species []. With SNP-chips  thousands of individuals can be cost-effectively genotyped. However  depending on the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a given population  it has been estimated that a reasonably powered GWAS requires as many as 300 000 to 500 000 SNPs [] []. In cattle  a high-density (HD) SNP-chip was developed that contains 777 k SNPs []  but HD SNP-chips are not yet available for most other livestock animals. However compared to NGS data  HD SNP-chips only represent a small fraction of the variation  given the 17 million DNA variants that were determined in cattle []. NGS thus represents a powerful alternative to array-based genotyping methods. To circumvent the economical and logistical difficulties involved in re-sequencing more than 1000 individuals  genotype imputation can be performed. Genotype imputation is a well-established method to combine information across collections of individuals with similar ancestry [] [] and to derive HD genotype information for individuals that were genotyped on a low or medium density set of loci []-[]. In livestock  genotype imputation accuracies have been mainly investigated in cattle  imputing low-density (3 k and 6 k) to medium (50 k) and medium to HD (777 k) SNP panels. The reported genotype imputation accuracies obtained in these studies ranged from 91.2% for imputation from 3 k to 50 k []  to 99.1% from 6 k to 50 k [] and to 99.7% from 50 k to 777 k []. Results in cattle show that the imputation of high-quality genotypes strongly depends on diverse parameters  including the proportion of missing genotypes []  the effective population size (N)  the level of LD []  the number of key ancestors and relatives in the reference population []  and the imputation algorithm applied [] []. Besides cattle  genotype imputation has also been investigated in pig []  sheep [] and horse []. So far  in horse  imputation has been performed to combine 50 k and 65 k genotypes of various horse breeds. Imputation accuracies ranged from 82.2% to 100% []. Here  we investigated the accuracy of direct imputation from 50 k SNP-chip data to sequence-level genotypes in the Franches-Montagnes (FM) horse breed. The FM breed is the last indigenous Swiss horse breed [] []. In the past  this breed was particularly used as a working horse in agriculture and transport. Nowadays  the main purpose of the breed includes leisure riding and driving activities [] []. During their breed history  FM horses have been crossbred and thus systematically admixed (e.g. with Warmblood and Arabians) to enhance their gait and riding ability. The last introgression with two Warmblood stallions occurred in the 1990s and is represented today by the stallion lineages N and Q in the studbook []. Shortly after this introgression  the studbook of the FM breed was closed. Estimates of the current N of the FM breed ranges from 29.1 to 128.1  depending on the methodology applied []. We have successfully identified major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for height and maxillary prognathism in FM horses [] []. However  we could not detect genome-wide associations for many other traits. Insufficient marker density of the applied SNP-chip (50 k) could be a possible reason. Increasing the marker density has been demonstrated to improve the power of genomic prediction [] and GWAS []. Therefore  the objectives of this study were to evaluate three methods for genotype imputation from the 50 k SNP-chip data to sequence level in the FM population. We genotyped 1077 horses of the FM horse breed with the Illumina Equine SNP50 BeadChip® that includes 54 602 SNPs. This dataset has been previously described in detail []. We then selected 20 highly informative FM horses based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) information scores [] for whole-genome sequencing. In addition  we selected a few influential ancestors and progeny of these horses to increase the phasing accuracy. In total  30 FM horses including two trios (sire  dam and offspring) and three duos (one parent and offspring) were sequenced. From this dataset  28 FM horses were already included in the aforementioned dataset of 1077 genotyped FM horses  while the other two horses were additionally genotyped on the 65 k SNP-chip  which shares 40 000 SNPs with the 50 k SNP-chip. The pedigree information of the 1079 horses revealed that the sires and the dams were included in the genotyped dataset for 707 and 207 horses  respectively. We also used pedigree information to determine the proportion of admixture by calculating the pedigree-based relatedness with crossbred horses. FM horses have experienced introgressions in the past  especially with Warmblood. In total  11 of the 30 sequenced horses showed a level of admixture greater than 10%. To account for the effect of admixture  we included 14 unrelated Warmblood horses  for which NGS data was available  in our analyses. Thus  altogether  a total of 44 horses  including 30 FM horses and 14 unrelated Warmblood horses were included in the analyses. We prepared fragment libraries with 300 bp insert size and collected one lane of Illumina HiSeq2000 paired-end reads (2 × 100 bp) for each horse. The fastq sequence reads were subjected to initial quality checks (average read length  average read quality  average read quality per position  distribution of bases along the sequence length) using FastQC []. Sequences of average length of 100 nucleotides were aligned against the reference genome EquCab2.0 using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA) version 0.5.9. [] with default parameters. The aligned data were processed with SAMtools [] and picard [] to sort them by chromosome coordinates and to mark duplicates. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [] was used for indel realignment  SNP calling  and SNP filtering. Reads marked as duplicates and with a mapping quality less than 30 were excluded for variant calling. Raw variant data in variant call format (version 4.0) were flagged for low quality and unreliable variants using the variant filtration module of GATK. Variant filtration was defined according to the GATK recommended best practices documentation []. Analysis parameters like variant confidence (from the QUAL field) divided by the unfiltered depth of non-reference samples  Fishers exact test to detect strand bias  HaplotypeScore  Ranksum test score for read mapping quality and the distance of the allele from the end of the read were used to filter SNPs as specified in the document. SNPs that did not match any of these conditions were considered good and marked PASS in the output VCF file. We compared the array-derived genotypes with the sequence-derived genotypes for the 30 sequenced FM horses. Genotype concordance of sequenced horses is defined as the ratio of identical genotypes and the total number of common SNPs typed with both methods. We had two horses with less than 95% genotype concordance  which were excluded from further analysis. We compared three commonly used imputation programs  including two population-based methods  Beagle [] and Impute2 []  and one method that combines LD and pedigree information  FImpute []. Methods were evaluated for two equine chromosomes (ECA)  ECA16 and ECA31. All programs were run with default parameters  except where noted. The imputation software package Beagle uses a so-called “localized haplotype-cluster model” to reconstruct haplotypes that are present in the reference population and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to calculate missing genotypes. In order to investigate the impact of different parameter settings using Beagle  we performed three imputation scenarios based on (i) un-phased genotypes  (ii) pre-phased genotypes (pre-phasing also with Beagle) and (iii) pre-phased genotypes including information of duos and trios of the reference population. Impute2 is also based on a HMM  but reconstructs haplotypes that are present in the reference and test population. For the final genotype imputation  the haplotype structure of the reference population is used. In addition  we used the program SHAPEIT [] to pre-phase the genotypes of the data  since this program also includes first-generation family information (duos and trios) for haplotype reconstruction. We set N equal to 100 for SHAPEIT and Impute2  which is a reliable estimate of the current N of the FM breed []. In Impute2  imputation was performed for fragments of 6 Mb. Output files of Impute2 were converted into ped and map files using GTOOL v0.7.5 []. GTOOL by default only converts SNP genotypes that have a genotype probability greater than 0.9  while genotypes below this threshold are set as missing. To provide an overall comparison between the three applied imputation methods  we set this threshold to 0  such that all genotypes were called. For all other analyses the default setting was used. The third method that we used was FImpute  which reconstructs haplotypes using family and pedigree information and performs imputation based on haplotype consistency of overlapping sliding windows []. We applied a cross-validation scheme to measure the accuracy of genotype imputation. Accuracy was defined as genotype concordance between the genotypes from NGS and the genotypes obtained by imputation. We had 28 FM horses with genome sequence and either 50 k SNP-chip genotypes (n = 26) or 65 k SNP-chip genotypes (n = 2). We split these horses into a test population of four horses and a reference population of 24 horses. We repeated this procedure seven times  such that each horse with genome sequence and 50 k SNP-chip genotypes was represented once in the test group. The horses with 65 k SNP-chip information were only used in the reference group. The duos and trios were equally distributed over all groups. We included all 1077 FM horses with 50 k SNP-chip genotypes for the haplotype reconstruction. Imputation from 50 k to sequence level genotypes was performed seven times  each time using a different group as test and reference population. After imputation  we determined the genotype concordance rate between true and imputed genotypes of the 26 sequenced horses  to evaluate the accuracy of imputation. For Beagle and Impute2  accuracy was assessed using the commands merge and merge-mode 7  as implemented in Plink []. For FImpute an R-code [] was applied. Using Plink  the concordance genotype rate is calculated based on the ratio of identical genotypes between sequenced and imputed loci  while genotype errors based on allelic state (homozygous vs. heterozygous) and origin (homozygous reference vs. homozygous alternative) are not differentiated. After the evaluation of the three imputation methods  all chromosomes were imputed with Impute2. Accuracy was assessed for each chromosome by the same cross-validation scheme as described above. Furthermore  we calculated the ratio between correctly imputed SNP genotypes and the number of non-missing genotypes for each chromosome using the “diff” and “lmiss” files implemented in Plink. We sequenced the genomes of 30 FM horses and 14 Warmblood horses. On average  we obtained 384 767 951 reads per animal  of which 94% mapped to the reference genome Equcab2.0. On average  there were 348 621 822 uniquely mapped reads per horse. The depth of coverage ranged from 2.66x to 25.27x [See Additional file ]. On average  8.66% of the mapped reads were marked as duplicate reads that aligned with identical start and end positions on the reference genome. We then called SNPs of the sequenced horses with respect to the reference genome and used 13 127 080 informative SNPs with a minor allelic frequency (MAF) greater than 1.5% and marked PASS for subsequent genotype imputation analyses. We compared the concordance between SNP-chip-derived genotypes and sequence-derived genotypes as a quality control. The mean overall concordance per horse was 98.5% (Figure A). The genotype concordance of two horses was very low compared to all other horses  with 85 and 91%  respectively. These two horses also had the lowest sequence coverage  which is the most likely explanation for the low genotyping concordance. They were excluded from further analyses. The genotype concordance for each of the remaining 28 FM horses was greater than 97%.  Concordance per horse: the boxplots illustrate the distribution of the values for each chromosome within each of the 30 sequenced FM horses; two horses that had genotype concordances smaller than 0.95 were excluded from subsequent analyses.  Concordance per chromosome: the boxplots illustrate the values for each horse within each autosome; note that there are two outliers for each chromosome that are below the threshold of 0.95; these two outliers correspond to the two horses that were subsequently excluded. We also analyzed the genotype concordance per chromosome (Figure B). ECA8  ECA12  and ECA13 had concordance values between 98 and 99%. All other chromosomes had a mean concordance greater than 99% across all horses. After these quality control steps  we retained 42 sequenced horses and 1077 horses with SNP-chip genotypes for the final genotype imputation. We imputed all SNPs of ECA16 and ECA31 for the sequenced horses in a cross-validation experiment. In this experiment  we had a total of 26 FM horses with both 50 k SNP-chip data and whole-genome sequence data. We analyzed the accuracy of imputation using three software programs (Table ). With all three programs  we found only very small differences in accuracy between the two chromosomes. Impute2 outperformed the two other programs and yielded a mean accuracy of ~92%. The two other programs had accuracies of ~77% (FImpute) and ~75% (Beagle). FImpute was computationally the most efficient program  yielding results within 15 minutes for ECA16  which included 470 000 SNPs  on an Intel Core2  2.8 GHz CPU with 98 GB of RAM. Running time increased to 6 and more than 48 hours for Impute2 and Beagle  respectively. For the shorter chromosome i.e. ECA31  with about 150 000 SNPs  a complete run with FImpute was finished after 7 minutes  compared to 1 and 4 hours with Impute2 and Beagle. For the two programs that use population-wide LD  Beagle and Impute2  we further evaluated various imputation scenarios using different parameters settings on ECA31. For Beagle  we found that pre-phasing led to an increase in accuracy of about 3%  while addition of first-generation family information increased the accuracy only by 1% (Table ). For Impute2  alternative settings of the SHAPEIT parameters were tested to identify optimal parameter settings for imputation of the whole genome (Table ). Apart from accuracy  we also evaluated the number of imputed SNPs per individual that passed the genotype probability of 0.9. The tested parameters for SHAPEIT included pedigree information  recombination rate (rho)  window-size  and N. For Impute2  we also tested the length of the imputed interval  N  and the impact of pre-phasing. Most of these changes did not have a major influence on imputation accuracy or the number of imputed SNPs passing the probability threshold (Table ). Only the use of the default value for N (which is 15 000 for SHAPEIT and 20 000 for Impute2) increased the genotype accuracy from ~95% to ~97% but simultaneously decreased the number of SNPs passing the probability threshold from 130 000 to about 54 000 per individual. Based on these findings and the required time for file preparation and computation  we decided to use the default parameter settings  except for the use of a smaller N (=100) for imputation of the full genome datasets. We then performed imputation for each chromosome separately in the 26 FM horses  using the same cross-validation design as before. We attempted to impute 13 127 080 SNPs in total. On average  11 770 355 SNPs per horse passed the probability threshold of 0.9. The overall genotype accuracy between experimental (determined by NGS) and imputed genotypes was 95.3%. The lowest accuracy (91.9%) was found for ECA12. All other chromosomes had imputation accuracies greater than 94.0%. Chromosome ECA14 had the highest accuracy  at 96.2% [See Additional file ]. Around 50% of the SNPs were accurately imputed (meaning an accuracy of 100% over all horses) for each animal and the vast majority of the SNPs were correctly imputed in at least 80% of the horses (Figure ).  The concordance was calculated in a cross-validation experiment comprising 26 FM horses for which 50 k SNP-chip and genome sequence data were available. The SNPs were divided into six concordance classes depending on the proportion of horses  which had correctly imputed genotypes. Roughly half of the SNPs showed perfect concordance between experimental and imputed genotypes and only very few SNPs had incorrect genotypes in more than 20% of the horses. Note the lower concordance of true and imputed SNPs on ECA12. The individual imputation accuracy was estimated based on results from imputing with Impute2 on ECA31. The accuracies per horse ranged from 85 to 99%. No difference in mean accuracy was found between males and females  while  the level of admixture of the horses was highly correlated with the individual imputation accuracy (r = -0.84) (Figure ).  The grey shaded bars show the accuracy per individual when only 28 FM horses were used as reference  the green bars show the accuracy when 14 Warmblood horses were added to the reference population and the blue dots show the Warmblood admixture of each evaluated FM horse. To account for the effect of admixture and to improve the overall imputation accuracy  we added genome sequence data of 14 Warmblood horses to our initial reference population of 28 FM horses. This led to an increase in the mean imputation accuracy from 95.3 to 96.8%. Individual accuracies increased for 24 of the 26 tested FM horses and ranged from 91 to 99% (Figure ). In this study  we evaluated the feasibility of imputing from 50 k SNP-chip data to almost 13 million SNPs in the FM horse breed. Initially  we obtained 50 k SNP-chip data on 1077 FM horses and genome sequences on 30 FM horses. The comparison of SNP-chip-derived genotypes versus sequence-derived genotypes provided an objective quality measurement for the NGS experiment and the variant calling pipeline. This comparison revealed that two horses had a poor genotype concordance between SNP-chip- and sequence-derived genotypes  which led to their exclusion from the analyses. The most probable reason why these two horses had such a low concordance was their low sequencing coverage. Subsequently  additional sequence reads for these horses were collected  which brought their genotype concordance to the same level as for all the others (data not shown)  but this data was not used in the analyses presented here. Here  we selected a total of 30 representative FM horses for re-sequencing. These horses explain a large fraction of the genetic variance of the population and therefore maximize the correct imputation of causal mutations [] []. Thus  we can expect to obtain most of the common variants but also variants that differ between the different stallion lineages. In addition  several phenotypes (e.g. linear description and conformation traits) of interest are covered by the sequenced animals  so that causal mutations for these traits should be included in our data. However  despite the optimal selection of representative individuals  it is possible that recent and very rare mutations are not contained in our limited dataset. We evaluated imputation accuracy using three software programs. We found that Impute2 had the highest imputation accuracy. This software has also been found to outperform Beagle  fastPhase  and FImpute in cattle [] []. Several factors may explain the difference in performance between imputation softwares  including method- and population-based differences (e.g. the reconstruction of haplotypes  the extent of LD and the size of the reference population). The greater accuracy of Impute2 in our dataset might be due to the extended LD that is present in the FM breed []  which allows for a better definition of long-range haplotypes. As mentioned before  Impute2 reconstructs haplotypes based on SNP information of the reference and test population  which becomes especially useful for small reference populations. Therefore  the difference between the two population-based methods (Impute2 and Beagle) is likely a result of the small reference population used []. Increasing the size of the reference population should result in the convergence of the accuracies of these two methods []. Although we assumed that all discrepancies between the imputed and sequenced-derived genotypes were due to imputation errors  it is clear that discrepancies could also be caused by sequencing errors. Imputation with different parameter settings for Beagle showed that pre-phasing and inclusion of first-generation pedigree information (duos and trios) increased the accuracy of genotype imputation  with pre-phasing having a greater impact than including the pedigree information. Using Impute2  pre-phasing the test population only slightly improved the genotype accuracies (Table ). Nevertheless  we recommend the data to be pre-phased and to include first-generation pedigree information in order to increase computational efficiency and haplotype reconstruction. We also explored the effect of different N settings in more detail. Using the default setting (N = 20 000) resulted in highly accurate genotypes but more than 60% of the SNPs did not pass the probability threshold of 0.9. Therefore  we used current N estimates for the FM breed (Ne = 100) in the final genotype imputation. We showed that 50 k genotypes could be directly imputed to sequence level genotypes. In cattle  SNP imputation is usually performed in multiple steps. 50 k SNP-chip data are imputed to HD data and then to sequence level []. The low N and the high genetic relatedness between FM horses also allow low-frequency alleles to be directly imputed from 50 k to sequence level genotypes with reasonable accuracy. However  with the upcoming release of an HD SNP-chip for horses  we expect that the imputation accuracy for our FM horse population can be further improved  by using HD genotypes for intermediate genotype imputation []. Most of the SNPs had a high accuracy. Compared to the other chromosomes  the accuracy was markedly reduced for ECA12. We suspect that SNPs on this chromosome may have incorrect positions in the reference genome EquCab2.0 or contain errors in sequencing calls  since this chromosome also showed a low concordance between SNP-chip- and sequence-derived genotypes. Imperfect concordance between NGS data and EquCab2.0 is not a completely unknown phenomenon []. In this study  the number of animals in the reference population was small. Thus  we designed a cross-validation scheme to measure the imputation accuracy for each horse. Despite the optimal choice of representative horses and the high level of LD within the FM breed  we observed high variations in genotype imputation accuracies between horses. We showed that the major factor causing the variation between horses was the level of admixture with introgressed Warmblood horses. Therefore  we expect that sequence level genotype imputation will result in greater imputation accuracies in closed populations than in highly admixed populations  especially when the number of sequenced animals and relatives is limited []. For the FM breed  we increased the genotype accuracy per horse by including Warmblood horses in the reference population. Our data show that imputation from 50 k SNP-chip data to 13 million SNPs with 95% accuracy is feasible in the FM horse breed. Impute2 was the best software for imputation in our dataset and the inclusion of additional Warmblood reference sequences increased the accuracy of imputation furthermore.

Prediction accuracy was measured as the correlation between predicted breeding values and observed phenotypes divided by the square root of the heritability. The data used concerned laying hens with phenotypes for number of eggs in the first production period and known genotypes. The hens were from two closely-related brown layer lines (B1 and B2)  and a third distantly-related white layer line (W1). Lines had 1004 to 1023 training animals and 238 to 240 validation animals. Training datasets consisted of animals of either single lines  or a combination of two or all three lines  and had 30 508 to 45 974 segregating single nucleotide polymorphisms.ResultsGenomic prediction models yielded 0.13 to 0.16 higher accuracies than pedigree-based BLUP. When excluding the line itself from the training dataset  genomic predictions were generally inaccurate. Use of multiple lines marginally improved prediction accuracy for B2 but did not affect or slightly decreased prediction accuracy for B1 and W1. Differences between models were generally small except for RRPCA which gave considerably higher accuracies for B2. Correlations between genomic predictions from different methods were higher than 0.96 for W1 and higher than 0.88 for B1 and B2. The greater differences between methods for B1 and B2 were probably due to the lower accuracy of predictions for B1 (~0.45) and B2 (~0.40) compared to W1 (~0.76).ConclusionsMulti-line genomic prediction did not affect or slightly improved prediction accuracy for closely-related lines. For distantly-related lines  multi-line genomic prediction yielded similar or slightly lower accuracies than single-line genomic prediction. Bayesian variable selection and GBLUP generally gave similar accuracies. Overall  RRPCA yielded the greatest accuracies for two lines  suggesting that using PCA helps to alleviate the “” problem in genomic prediction."

Overall  RRPCA yielded the greatest accuracies for two lines  suggesting that using PCA helps to alleviate the “” problem in genomic prediction. In recent years  genomic prediction has been adopted in many breeding programs for the main livestock species  to enable genomic selection [] instead of traditional selection based on performance of selection candidates or close relatives such as sibs or offspring. At the same time  much research effort has been geared towards developing models for genomic prediction (for a review  see []). Most of these are linear models  which can roughly be divided into three groups. One group assumes that all SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) contribute equally to genetic variance  and therefore apply equal shrinkage to the effects of each SNP. This group includes models such as genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) []  and random regression or ridge regression-BLUP (RRBLUP) []  which are known to be equivalent [] and effectively use genome-wide relationships that are computed from the SNPs. A second group of models avoids the use of shrinkage by linear dimensionality reduction of the SNP genotypes. This group includes principal component regression e.g. []. A third group of models includes methods that allow for different contributions to genetic variance across SNPs by differential shrinkage e.g. BayesA and BayesB []  BayesC []  and Bayesian stochastic search variable selection [] []. Many studies have compared the performance of different linear genomic prediction models (for a review  see []). Most of these comparisons used data of a single breed or line. Within a single breed or line  linkage disequilibrium (LD) between QTL (quantitative trait loci) and SNPs may extend across a relatively large distance  and therefore a QTL is expected to be in LD with several surrounding SNPs. In such situations  genomic prediction models can apply various strategies to capture the QTL effects. They can  for instance  try to put most of the effect on the SNP that has the highest LD with the QTL  or distribute the QTL effect across multiple surrounding SNPs. The first strategy may be more easily achieved with a model that allows for differential shrinkage  while the second strategy may be more easily achieved with a GBLUP or RRBLUP type of model. Despite these differences in strategies  in general the different models yield very similar predictive abilities  which suggests that for within-breed or within-line selection  the strategy that the model uses has generally limited impact on the results. For applications of across-breed or -line genomic prediction  it is important that the LD between SNPs and QTL is the same across those breeds or lines []. With increasing genetic distance between breeds or lines  a higher SNP density is required to achieve the same LD between SNP and QTL in those breeds or lines [] []. This implies that SNP density is an important factor for the accuracy of across-breed prediction []. Thus  the number of SNPs that are useful for genomic prediction per QTL is expected to be smaller for across-breed or line applications compared to single-breed or line applications. As a consequence  with increasing distance between breeds or lines  the differential shrinkage models are expected to have a higher predictive ability than their GBLUP type counterparts  which is supported by a few empirical studies that reported slightly higher accuracies for differential shrinkage models applied to multi-breed training datasets [] []. However  when QTL effects differ between lines or breeds  the benefit of using differential shrinkage models may be very small. The objective of our study was to investigate whether genomic data across lines improves the accuracy of genomic predictions per line  and whether such improvement depends on the linear model used. Specifically  we tested the hypothesis that use of differential shrinkage models is more beneficial when lines are genetically further apart. We used data from three lines of layer chickens  including two closely-related lines of brown layers and one distantly-related line of white layers. To evaluate the usefulness of data from different populations for genomic prediction  three different pure-bred lines of layer chickens were analysed. The brown layer lines B1 and B2 were more closely related to each other than to the white line (W1)  albeit that lines B1 and B2 were separated for at least 25 years. All three lines have been selected for egg production. With this data  we were able to investigate the influence of the relatedness of lines on the accuracy of genomic prediction. The trait analysed was number of eggs in the first production period. A total of 3753 female birds with phenotypes were genotyped with the chicken Illumina Infinium iSelect Beadchip which contains 57 636 SNPs. Edits on the genotype data were performed for the three lines simultaneously. Those edits comprised removing SNPs with a call rate below 95%  a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 2%  that had no homozygous genotypes  or that had a Chi test for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium greater than 600. After these edits  45 974 SNPs remained. In total  1263 birds were genotyped in line B1  1246 in line B2 and 1244 in line W1. Differences between genotypes of birds in different lines were evaluated by comparing allele frequencies between lines. In addition  the Euclidian distances between genotypes of all pairs of birds were computed as   where  and  are the genotypes of animals  and   respectively  on SNP . To evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction  the data was split into training and validation datasets. The validation datasets consisted of the youngest generation of birds  comprising 238 to 240 birds for the three lines. The phenotypes of these birds were set to missing and their breeding values were predicted using the training dataset. Phenotypes were pre-corrected for fixed effects of hatch week. The accuracy of the estimated breeding values (EBV) was computed as the correlation coefficient between the EBV and the observed phenotypes of the validation animals  which was a single own performance record  divided by the square root of the heritability of the trait. Heritabilities from routine genetic evaluations were used  i.e. 0.41 for lines B1 and B2 and 0.51 for line W1. Standard errors of the prediction accuracies were approximated using the expected sampling variance of an estimated correlation   e.g. []  as . Bias of the genomic predictions was assessed by evaluating the coefficient of the regression of phenotypes on EBV of the validation animals. Standard errors of those regression coefficients were computed using bootstrapping with the R-package ¿boot¿ []. The bootstrapping procedure involved computing regression coefficients for 10 000 bootstrap samples of the validation animals. Standard errors were computed as the standard deviation of those 10 000 estimated regression coefficients. Using those standard errors   the regression coefficients () were considered to be not significantly different from the expected value of 1 when []. For each line  seven training datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction. As a base  the training dataset consisting of birds of its own line was used. To evaluate across-line genomic prediction  training datasets that included one of the other two lines were evaluated. To evaluate whether genomic prediction can benefit from data from other lines  three training datasets consisting of birds of two of the three lines were composed  as well as a training dataset that included all birds from all three lines. Training datasets with one  two and three lines  included slightly more than 1000  2000 and 3000 animals  respectively (Table ). Some of the retained SNPs segregated only in one or two lines  and therefore were not used in some training datasets. Across training datasets  the number of segregating SNPs ranged from 30 508 to 45 974 (Table ). Eight methods for genomic prediction were evaluated and compared to a pedigree-based BLUP model. These methods included three different implementations of GBLUP  two implementations of RRBLUP  RRPCA  Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) and BayesC. In the following  we start with a general description of linear genomic prediction models  followed by a short description of each individual model. Genomic prediction is aimed at predicting the phenotype  of an animal using its  SNP genotypes  by uncovering the implicit mapping function  =  (). Linear models assume that the mapping function is linear by  () = . The vector  contains the linear weights imposed on SNP genotypes  which effectively are the marker effects. As a learning problem  the marker effects are estimated from a training dataset consisting of  animals whose genotypes and phenotypes are characterized by ( <U+2009>)  for animal  = 1 <U+2009>2 <U+2009>… <U+2009>. The marker effects are estimated by minimizing the prediction error () computed from the observed phenotype value  and estimated phenotype value  within the training dataset as: Minimization of the loss function  in Equation () with regard to  results in the following estimate [] []: where matrix  contains the genotypes of the training animals and  is a column vector composed of all phenotypes. One of the major problems of linear regression applied for genomic prediction is the over-fitting phenomenon caused by the fact that the number of training animals is generally much smaller than the number of genotypes ( < < )  which is also known as the small sample-to-size (SSS) problem in general machine learning theory [] []. One straightforward drawback is that the solution to  depends on a non-invertible matrix    which is the so-called `ill-posed¿ problem []. This problem is more severe when higher-density SNP panels are used  which are expected to convey more accurate information on the animals. Another well-known disadvantage of linear regression is that it is too flexible in cases with an enormous number of (highly) correlated covariates that are used for prediction [] []. To overcome this problem  a regularization parameter is added to the model  which in the case of genomic prediction includes the variances attributed to each SNP  e.g. []. Thereby  this regularization term can act as an important carrier to incorporate prior information into the regression model []¿[]. In other words  it may be helpful to select SNPs that are  known to be important  instead of completely learning the weights of each SNP from the regression model. To overcome the limited size of the training dataset  the structures of linear weights  are incorporated into the regression framework. There are three main approaches to perform shrinkage on the marker effects []: (1) penalizing   (2) applying differential shrinkage to  using probabilistic modelling  and (3) reducing the length of . [] []. In this section  several state-of-the-art regression models from these three categories are described  which will be adopted for the multi-line genomic prediction. Ridge regression penalizes the sum of squares of  with the aim of controlling the arbitrary scale of regression coefficients  which makes it possible to alleviate over-fitting on the training dataset. In concrete terms  the linear regression in Equation () is modified as follows: where |||| is the 2-norm of the vector   which is the regularization term and  controls the trade-offs between the prediction error and model complexity. When  goes to 0  this model reduces to Equation (). Using Equation   the solution becomes: The BLUP models assume that   computed from the error variance  and   which are SNP variances that are assumed to be the same for all SNPs is equal to: Inserting this definition of  into the predictor of Equation () results in the well-known RRBLUP model [] []. In our study  RBLUP was solved using the preconditioned conjugated gradient method implemented in the software package MiXBLUP []. In this implementation  genotypes are centred and scaled before being included in the model. Results obtained with an implementation using Gauss-Seidel  similar to Legarra and Misztal []  were very similar and are therefore not presented. Method GBLUP has been shown to be mathematically equivalent to the RRBLUP model []. In our study  we applied three different implementations of GBLUP. The first  hereafter referred to as GBLUP_VR  used a genomic relationship matrix () that is computed as described by VanRaden []. The  matrix was computed once  including all three lines  and used for all training datasets. The second  hereafter referred to as GBLUP_%id  computed  as the fraction of SNP alleles identical between two individuals  where loci with identical homozygotes were scored as 1  opposite homozygotes as 0  and all others as 0.5. The third computed  as the excess of identical homozygotes based on expected homozygosity: ([O(H) ¿ O(H)] ¿ E(H))/( ¿ E(H))  where E(H) is the expected number of homozygous SNP genotypes based on allele frequencies obtained from the whole population  O(H) is the observed number of identical homozygous SNP genotypes in the two individuals  and O(H) is the observed number of opposing homozygous SNP genotypes in the two individuals. These estimates were obtained from PLINK  using the ¿¿het¿ command. Preliminary analyses showed that GBLUP_VR and the third GBLUP model gave very similar results (correlation between EBV > 0.996)  so results of the third GBLUP model were not presented. Another commonly used class of genomic prediction models are the variable selection models. These models perform a regression on SNP genotypes similar to RRBLUP  but the variance assigned to each SNP  is estimated in the model and may have a different value for each SNP. Specifically  both BayesC and Bayes stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) determine in each iteration of the Gibbs chain whether a particular SNP has a large effect on the phenotypes or not. If the SNP does not have a large effect  then BayesC effectively sets its effect to 0 in that iteration of the chain []  while BSSVS estimates and assigns a small effect to the SNP [] []. In this way  variable selection models are able to better fit traits that are (at least partly) underpinned by QTL of large effect [] []. Details on the implementation of both models are presented elsewhere []. Based on past experience  the parameter p that specifies the proportion of loci that does not have a large effect  was set to 0.9 for BayesC and to 0.999 for BSSVS. The underlying idea of both penalized regression and the above described Bayesian models is to limit the degrees of freedom to estimate the marker effects . Principal component analysis (PCA) is compatible with most regression models since it enables pre-processing of the data that are used in the subsequent regression models. The low-dimensional representation of the genotype data that results from the use of PCA  implies that computational costs are considerably lower than for other models that explicitly include genotypes of all SNPs. To the best of our knowledge  the use of regression on principal components (PC) of genotypes for genomic prediction has only been studied in the context of a single line or breed [] []¿[] but not for genomic prediction based on multiple lines or breeds. To investigate the potential of principal component regression for multi-line genomic prediction  an in-depth analysis of PC of the SNP genotypes will be presented. PCA is one of the most widely-used dimensionality reduction algorithms. Its target is to combine a large number of correlated covariates into a limited number of PC that explain a maximum amount of variance in the data. In the context of genomic prediction  this means that the information of a number of SNPs that are correlated are combined into PC  which are then included in the genomic prediction model based on decreasing the proportion of the total variance explained. As a result  SNPs with low MAF may not be included in the prediction due to their expected lack of relevant information. Combining the genotypes of all SNPs could be done by using a linear projection  =   where the matrix  is the projection matrix with dimension  ×  (?<?)  where  is the number of animals   is the number of PC retained (i.e. those with the largest eigenvalues)  and  is the low-dimensional representation of . The objective function is to maximize the amount of the total genotypic variance captured by the reduced vector  over the entire training dataset: where the operator  refers to the sum of the diagonal elements of the denoted matrix and matrix  contains only the SNP genotypes of the training animals. The solution of the projection matrix  is the first  eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of genotypes  . To complete the regression analysis  the standard regression model as shown in Equation () is applied  which is hereafter referred to as RRPCA. For all training scenarios  PC were derived based on the genotypes of the training animals of all three lines simultaneously. The number of PC used in RRPCA was determined by selecting the minimum number of PC required to explain 97% of the variation in the genotype data. In addition  the prediction accuracy of PCA was evaluated across the whole range of PC  to investigate the potential of PCA  assuming the user is able to determine the most optimal settings a priori. The variance components used in the models as well as to compute the accuracies were derived from parameters used in routine breeding value estimation procedures that were applied in the breeding program from which the analyzed layer lines originated. When the training dataset contained multiple lines  the average of the variance components across those lines was taken. In the models that explicitly used (RRBLUP) or estimated SNP effects (BSSVS and BayesC)  the (prior) SNP variance was computed as the total genetic variance divided by the number of SNPs  because the genotypes were centred and scaled such that they had a variance of 1 for all these models. To evaluate the benefit of using genomic prediction models over the use of conventional BLUP models that rely on pedigree data  the latter model was also fitted to the training datasets. In this model  the variance components used were the same as those used for the GBLUP model. For each line  9 to 10 generations of pedigree data were available  with a total of 27 808 to 31 060 animals per line. Differences between lines were first evaluated by comparing SNP allele frequencies for each pair of lines (Figure ). The MAF of the SNPs in lines B1 and B2 had a correlation () of 0.35. Based on this  these two lines were more similar than line B1 versus line W1 ( = 0.11) and line B2 versus line W1 ( = -0.09). The number of fixed SNPs was 8440 (18.4%) for line B1  8533 for line B2 (18.6%) and 19 412 (42.2%) for line W1. Of the SNPs that were fixed in line B2  5404 were fixed for the same allele in line B1  but only 854 in line W1  while 663 alleles were fixed for the same allele in lines W1 and B1. Three SNPs were fixed for opposite alleles in lines B1 and B2  while 1548 and 1492 SNPs were fixed for opposite alleles in line W1  and lines B1 and B2  respectively. The lower relatedness of line W1 to the other two lines  as observed from differences in MAF and fixed alleles  was also reflected by the average Euclidian distance between genotypes of birds of different lines (Figure ). Within-line  birds of line W1 were on average more related than birds in line B1 and line B2.                                                       The Euclidean distance is computed as a measure of the distance between any two individuals based on their genotypes. The distance is visualized from very small distances (black) to very large distances (light grey). Accuracies of the genomic predictions in the validation data  when using only the line itself in the training dataset  were  on average  0.13  0.13 and 0.16 higher than accuracies obtained from the regular BLUP model for lines B1  B2  and W1  respectively (Tables    and ). In the following  results for the genomic prediction models are presented for each line  separately. Across all models  the highest prediction accuracy for line B1 was always observed when the training data only included line B1 or both lines B1 and B2 (Table ). Differences in accuracies between these two scenarios were generally very small. Across models  using only information of the closely-related line B2 yielded accuracies that ranged from 0.23 to 0.31. For line B2  all models showed the highest prediction accuracy when the training data included all three lines (Table )  which  across models  yielded accuracies that were 0.01 to 0.05 higher than the accuracies obtained when only line B2 itself was included in the training dataset. This suggests that multi-line genomic prediction was beneficial for this line. This is supported by the observation that accuracies for B2 were consistently greater than 0.10 when either line B1 or line W1 were used for training. For line W1  just using W1 animals in the training dataset generally yielded the highest accuracy (Table ). Adding training animals from lines B1 and B2  resulted in a small drop in accuracy by ~0.02 and 0.01  respectively. Using  only line B1 or B2  or both  for training resulted in negative accuracies for line W1  which ranged from -0.14 to -0.39. The GBLUP model yielded higher prediction accuracies than the other models for line B1 (Table ). For line B2  the accuracy of RRPCA was considerably higher than that of the other models for all training datasets that included line B2  including RRBLUP (Table ). This suggests that the PC enable the most relevant information of the genotypes to be conveyed for this line. For line W1  RRPCA also tended to have the highest accuracy  although the differences with the other models were very small (Table ). Predicted genomic breeding values obtained from the different models were compared for the training dataset that included all three lines  by computing correlations between the predictions in the validation data (Table ). These correlations were in general smallest for line B1 and largest for line W1. The same trend was observed for the correlations between the predictions from BLUP and the genomic prediction models  with average correlations of 0.46  0.52 and 0.76 for lines B1  B2 and W1  respectively. Correlations between predictions from the same pair of models showed consistent trends across the three lines (Table ). Despite the equivalence of RRBLUP and GBLUP  correlations between predictions obtained from these two models were as low as 0.96 and were of similar magnitude as correlations with predictions from the Bayesian models. The correlation between predictions from BayesC and BSSVS was equal to 1.00 for all three lines. The genomic breeding values obtained with the RRPCA model deviated most from those of the other models and had the lowest average correlations with the other models i.e. 0.91  0.91 and 0.97 for lines B1  B2 and W1  respectively. Bias of the predicted breeding values is assessed by regressing phenotypes on the predicted breeding values. The coefficients of those regressions (see Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3) show that  for lines B1 and W1  the variance of the predicted breeding values was underestimated  i.e. all regression coefficients were greater than 1.0. Generally  the regression coefficients were closest to 1 when the line itself was included in the training dataset. In fact  within each model  regression coefficients tended to be very similar across training datasets that included the line itself. This indicates that adding other lines in the training dataset did not affect the scale of the EBV. The number of PC that explained 97% of the variance of the genotypes in the training dataset ranged from 452 to 1189 (Table ). The number of PC clearly increased when another line was added to the training dataset. Prediction accuracies obtained with RRPCA with increasing numbers of PC included in the model are shown in Figures    and  for the three lines. Here we consider only those scenarios where the training dataset included the evaluated line  i.e. four scenarios per line. The PCA was either based on the training dataset alone or based on all lines  regardless of which lines were included in the training dataset. Note that the number of PC is always smaller than the number of training samples. As a result  the curves in Figures    and  for scenarios for which PC were derived using only one or two lines in the training dataset did not extend as far across the X-axis as those including all three lines.  Breeding values for line B1 are predicted using seven different training datasets.  Breeding values for line B2 are predicted using seven different training datasets.  Breeding values for line W1 are predicted using seven different training datasets. The results for line B2 shown in Figure   clearly indicate that the multi-line training on both PCA and the ridge regression model help to improve the prediction accuracies. Comparing the two scenarios that used the same lines as training data in the ridge regression model but different combinations of lines to perform the PCA shows that the scenario using all lines for PCA always reached a higher maximum accuracy than the scenarios using only the training dataset for PCA. For lines B1 and W1 (Figures  and )  the maximum prediction accuracy was in both cases achieved when only the line itself was used both for PCA and in the ridge regression model  and fewer PC were required to reach this maximum accuracy. The main objective of our study was to investigate whether genomic prediction using a training dataset across lines improves the accuracy of genomic prediction within a line  and whether such potential improvement depends on the linear model used. The results showed only a small gain in prediction accuracy for line B2 and no improvement for the other two lines. When using data from the two closely-related lines B1 and B2 together  a consistent small gain in accuracy was observed for line B2 but not for line B1. The difference in the initial accuracies for B1 and B2 likely explains these apparent inconsistent results; line B2 had a relatively lower accuracy when training on its within-line data than line B1. This implies that it was easier for line B2 to gain accuracy from adding information from a closely-related line  while the expected added benefit of adding information from line B2 to line B1 was smaller. Interestingly  using information only from line B1 to predict line B2 resulted in a comparatively smaller prediction accuracy than using only information from line B2 to predict line B1. In any case  the results suggest that  between lines B1 and B2  both the QTL effects and the LD between SNPs and QTL were sufficiently similar to achieve selection response in one line when using SNP effects estimated in the other line. For the unrelated line W1  enlarging the training dataset with the samples from lines B1 and B2 slightly decreased prediction accuracies on average. These results suggest that the QTL effects are too different for line W1 compared to lines B1 and B2  or the LD between SNPs and QTL is not sufficiently conserved across these lines. Based on these findings  we conclude that  for closely-related lines  genomic prediction based on multi-line data that includes data from other lines in addition to data from the line itself  may lead to an increase in prediction accuracy or at least does not substantially degrade the prediction accuracy. Our findings are in line with the general observation in the literature that the gain from multi-line or multi-breed genomic prediction is at most limited []¿[]. Similar to our study  other groups have also reported that this potential small increase in prediction accuracy is observed when lines or breeds are related []  which can be evaluated for each trait separately by estimating a genetic correlation between lines or breeds []. Moreover  the benefit from including multi-line data tends to be more pronounced for numerically smaller breeds or lines []  while there is only a very small increase if there is already a lot of information available from the breed or line itself []. In our case  the numbers of animals included in the training dataset were very similar across the lines  but as discussed above  the line with the smallest accuracy based on its own data gained most from using a multi-line training dataset. The accuracies achieved within each of the three lines clearly differed. With GBLUP  prediction accuracies were equal to 0.50  0.30 and 0.77 for lines B1  B2 and W1  respectively. The 238 to 240 validation animals had 144  155 and 186 of their dams included in the training dataset for lines B1  B2 and W1  respectively. This resulted in average squared pedigree-based relationships of 0.0093  0.0127 and 0.0147 for lines B1  B2 and W1  respectively. Based on these numbers  line B1 was expected to have the lowest accuracy and line W1 the highest []. The observed higher accuracy for line B1 compared to B2 was therefore quite unexpected  also considering the observed similarities between these two lines (e.g. Figures  and ) and their similar trait heritabilities. In another study []  on brown layers with a training dataset of similar size  accuracies of ~0.35 and ~0.5 were reported using GBLUP for early and late egg production  respectively  which falls in the range of accuracies observed here for lines B1 and B2. Line W1 achieved a considerably higher accuracy than lines B1 and B2  because the validation animals for this line had somewhat stronger links with the training animals of the line itself  the trait had a heritability that was ~0.1 higher compared to B1 and B2  and it was more inbred  as commonly observed for white compared to brown layer lines e.g. []. Across the three lines  no model was consistently better than the others. Remarkably  the Bayesian variable selection models never outperformed the other models  despite our expectation that they can put more weight on SNPs that have consistent LD with QTL across lines. Using the currently available 600k SNP panel [] instead of the 60k SNP chip is expected to result in at least a small increase in accuracy across all models  and may lead to a relatively larger improvement in accuracy for the Bayesian variable selection models compared to GBLUP. Nevertheless  our results indicate that the investigated trait is polygenic  i.e. that it is controlled by many genes with small effects  which was confirmed in a genome-wide association study that used data from brown layers for a similar trait []. The GBLUP and RRBLUP models are expected to be mathematically equivalent []. Our results  however  showed correlations between GBLUP_VR and RRBLUP as low as 0.96 for lines B1 and B2 and 0.98 for line W1. In our implementation of the RRBLUP model  the SNP genotypes were centred and scaled  such that the genotype codes for each SNP had a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. The GBLUP_VR model uses a  matrix that uses centred genotypes that are not scaled by their variances. Instead of performing the scaling of variances at the level of the genotypes  it is performed for all SNPs simultaneously at the level of the relationships. This implies that the RRBLUP implementation used in our study puts relatively more emphasis on SNPs with low MAF compared to GBLUP_VR  which may explain the observed differences in results between these two models. Since there are few previous studies on the use of PCA for genomic prediction and because it has been suggested that it may be particularly beneficial for across population genomic prediction []  we analyzed its potential impact on prediction accuracy. If we compare RRBLUP and RRPCA  the only model difference is whether PCA is applied or not. In line B2  RRPCA performed clearly better than RRBLUP. Extracting the PC using the training dataset of all lines instead of using only the line itself may lead to somewhat higher accuracies  as suggested by Figures    and . Results showed that for lines B2 and W1 (Figures  and )  the maximum accuracy was reached when using only the first ~40% of the PC  which accounted for 95% of the variance in the genotype data. This suggests that models that internally perform variable selection  such as BayesC  are expected to be better able to put most emphasis on those genotypes that are important  conditional on the observed phenotypes. However  this was not confirmed  since BayesC was generally among the models with the lowest accuracy. As discussed previously  this may be alleviated by using a higher SNP density. Another reason that may explain why BayesC did not outperform the other models could be that a suboptimal value of the parameter p was used; the number of PC used increased up to twofold when training animals of all three lines were used (Table )  and therefore an implementation of e.g. BayesC that explicitly estimates p [] may achieve higher accuracies. In any case  the RRPCA results suggest that regularization by minimizing the -norm of linear weights is not sufficient to alleviate the over-fitting problem of genomic prediction. The impact of this over-fitting may be much more pronounced when the number of SNPs increases drastically compared to the number of phenotypes  as would be the case when using whole-genome sequence data. The regression coefficients (see Additional file : Tables S1  S2 and S3) showed that substantial bias was present in several scenarios. However  across training datasets that included the evaluated line  the regression coefficients were generally relatively consistent within models. Regression coefficients for genomic predictions using only the line itself as training data were similar to those for EBV from pedigree-based BLUP. Standard errors of the regression coefficients were high but lowest when the evaluated line was included in the training dataset. The standard errors indicated that the regression coefficients were not significantly different from 1 for lines B1 and B2  across nearly all combinations of models and training datasets  (see Additional file : Tables S1 and S2). However  for line W1  the regression coefficients were in nearly all cases significantly different from 1 (see Additional file : Table S3). The regression coefficients suggested that the variance of the EBV tended to be underestimated for lines B1 and W1  perhaps because the available animals with genotype and phenotype information in the training data for each line did not cover the whole range of selection candidates  i.e. only ~2/3 of the validation animals had their dam included in the training dataset for these two lines. However  for line B2 also only ~2/3 of the validation animals had their dam included in the training dataset  and for this line the variance of the EBV was across models generally slightly overestimated. In some scenarios for lines B1 and W1  when the evaluated line was not included in the training dataset  the regression coefficients had substantial negative values. Combined with the substantial negative accuracies  which were significantly lower than 0 for line W1  this suggests that some QTL have opposite phase with the surrounding SNPs in the different lines. It is  however  quite unlikely that this is the case for most of the QTL  which is required to explain the negative accuracies. Therefore  it remains unclear what the cause of the negative accuracies and regression coefficients is. Small improvements in the accuracy of genomic predictions from using the multi-line training datasets were observed for line B2 but not for lines B1 and W1. Data heterogeneity might be one of the major reasons for these line differences  i.e. the allele frequencies differed between lines. However  linear models estimate the average marker effects and maximize the prediction performance over the whole training dataset  which means that estimates obtained from multi-line training do not necessarily best fit the data from each line. Therefore  another promising direction of multi-line genomic prediction may be to model the data locally  rather than across the whole training dataset. Effectively  such models would be able to put the greatest emphasis on information from closely-related individuals  while effectively ignoring information from distantly-related individuals. Thus  such models do not make assumptions about linearity across the whole data and would be non-linear by nature. The performance of non-linear models for multi-line genomic prediction is investigated in a follow-up study. Our results indicate that multi-line genomic prediction may be effective when lines are closely-related. In the case of multi-line training with two distantly-related chicken lines  genomic prediction using only the line itself yielded similar or slightly lower accuracies than multi-line genomic prediction. Bayesian variable selection models and GBLUP type of models generally gave similar accuracies. The RRPCA model yielded substantially higher accuracies for one line  which suggests that using a compact representation of the genotype data  as achieved by PCA  can indeed alleviate the severe ¿ < ¿ problem in genomic prediction  although this appears to be line-specific. The Bayesian variable selection models were also expected to be able to achieve such selective representation of the genotype data  but were not able to outperform the other models. Performance of the Bayesian models could perhaps be enhanced by using higher density data  or by allowing the proportion of selected markers (1-p) to be determined by the model. MPLC supervised the study  performed the analyses with BSSVS and BayesC and wrote large parts of the initial manuscript. HH wrote parts of the Methods section and performed the RRPCA analyses. AV and JV provided the data. AV helped in describing the dataset and interpreting the results. JN performed the analyses with conventional pedigree-based BLUP and RRBLUP. JJW prepared the data set  performed the analyses with the different GBLUP models  and wrote parts of the methods and results section.

The proposed unified method integrated and blended several sources of information well into a genetic evaluation by avoiding double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. The unified method can also be extended to other types of situations such as single-step genomic or multi-trait evaluations  combining information across different traits. Simultaneous use of all available data by best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a condition to predict unbiased estimated breeding values (EBV) []. However  this condition is not often fully met. For example  in dairy cattle  while foreign bulls are often widely used  e.g. through artificial insemination  evaluating populations based only on internal phenotypic data (i.e. internal records) will lead to potentially biased and less accurate evaluations []. The reason is that external phenotypic data used to select these foreign bulls are not available at the internal level. Multiple across country evaluation (MACE)  performed at an international level by International Bull Service (Interbull  Uppsala  Sweden)  allows EBV  for each population scale  to be aggregated into a single ranking for international dairy sires. However  this has no influence on internal evaluations. These issues are also relevant in the setting of current developments of genomic multi-step or single-step prediction methods (e.g.  []-[]). Because external phenotypic data are not available at the internal level  methods were developed to combine external information  i.e. external EBV and associated reliabilities (REL)  with internal data to improve accuracy of internal genetic evaluations. A first type of approaches is based on performing  a posteriori  an additional step after the genetic evaluation at the internal level. These approaches combine external and internal EBV based on selection index theory (e.g.  [])  based on mixed model theory (e.g.  []) or based on bivariate evaluations (e.g.  []). One of the problems of a posteriori approaches is that external information used for selection will not contribute to the estimation of fixed effects at the internal level  which can create potential biases. A second type of approaches combines external information simultaneously with internal phenotypic data in genetic evaluations at the internal level. Simultaneous combination of external information and internal phenotypic data can be carried out using different methods. However  to our knowledge  the following two approaches are the most used. First  external information can be directly included by converting this information into pseudo-records for fictive daughters of external animals (e.g.  []). Similar approaches were proposed to include external information into internal single-step genomic evaluations (e.g.  [] []). Second  external information can be directly included by changing both the mean and (co)variance of the prior distributions of genetic effects in a Bayesian approach  as mentioned  for example  by Gianola and Fernando []. Quaas and Zhang [] [] and Legarra et al. [] proposed two Bayesian derivations to integrate external information into internal genetic evaluations in the context of multi-breed genetic evaluations for beef cattle. These two derivations consider external information as priors of internal genetic effects. Vandenplas and Gengler [] compared these two derivations and proposed some improvements that concerned mainly double-counting of contributions due to relationships among external animals. Indeed  an EBV of an animal combines information from its own records (i.e.  contributions due to own records) and from records of all relatives through its parents and its progeny (i.e.  contributions due to relationships) [] []. Therefore  integration of EBV for relatives can cause the same contributions that are due to relationships to be counted several times  which can bias genetic evaluations at the internal level. Both types of approaches i.e. that combine available information a posteriori or simultaneously  raise another issue if the external information results from an evaluation that combines external and internal records  which is that some contributions due to records will be considered several times when external information is combined with internal records. Although this is a major issue for common sources of external information (e.g.  MACE information)  to our knowledge  only a few studies have proposed solutions to the double-counting of contributions due to records (e.g.  [] [] []). The proposed solutions were developed as an additional pre-processing step before integration of external information. Furthermore  in many situations  integration of several sources of external information into genetic evaluations at the internal level may be needed but this has not been studied to our knowledge. In such cases  double-counting of contributions due to records could be worse if external information from several evaluations were  at least partially  based on the same internal records  and/or on the same external records  and integrated into the same genetic evaluation. Thus  the aim of this research was to develop a unified method to integrate and blend simultaneously several  potentially related  external sources of information into an internal genetic evaluation based on a Bayesian approach. In order to achieve this aim  methods were developed to avoid double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records generated by the integration of several sources of information. This resulted in modified mixed model equations (MME) that integrate and blend simultaneously several sources of information and avoid double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. The performance of the developed equations was evaluated using simulated and real datasets. Assume an internal genetic evaluation (referred to with the subscript E) based on internal data (i.e. a set of phenotypic records: ) that provides internal information (i.e. EBV and associated REL obtained from the evaluation E). Also  assume an i external genetic evaluation (  referred to with the subscript E) that is based on the i source of external data (i.e. the i set of phenotypic records not used by evaluation E and free of internal data: ) and that provides the i source of external information  i.e.  all available external EBV (EBV) and associated REL (e.g.  EBV and associated REL obtained from evaluation E based only on external data E and EBV and associated REL obtained from evaluation E based only on external data E). In addition to be free of internal data  it is also assumed that each i source of external data was free of the other -1 sources of external data. These assumptions lead to each i source of external information to be free of internal data and information  as well as of the -1 other external data and information. Two groups of animals  hereafter called external and internal animals  are defined according to the i source of external information. Therefore  for each i source of external information  external animals (subscript A with  = 1  2 ¿  ) are defined as animals that are associated with this i source of external information and for which internal data and/or information is available or that have relationships with animals involved in the internal evaluation E. All animals that are not defined as external animals for the i source of external information are defined as internal animals (subscript ). Internal animals are then defined as animals associated with only internal information when considering the i source of external information. It is noted that external animals may be associated with different sources of external information and that an animal may be considered as external for the i source of external information and internal for the -1 other sources of external information because the definitions of external and internal animals depend only on the source of external information considered. Those definitions are summarized in Table . In addition  because pedigree information for animals can be easily integrated into a genetic evaluation  it is assumed that the same complete pedigree information could be used for all animals for each genetic evaluation. Concerning the notation of matrices in the following sections (e.g.  )  the subscript E refers to the i source of external information and the subscript within brackets (A) refers to the l group of animals. The  sources of external information must be integrated into the internal evaluation E. For external animals associated with the i source of external information  all EBV are summarized by the vector of external EBV    and by the prediction error (co)variance matrix  . Because  could be estimated with an equivalent external genetic evaluation that includes the internal animals in the pedigree through a genetic (co)variance matrix extended to all animals for the i source of external information    the vector of external EBV for all internal and external animals for the i source of external information is estimated as: A modified set of multi-trait mixed model equations that integrate  sources of external information  each summarized by  and its associated prediction error (co)variance matrix  for the i source of external information  can be written as [See Additional file  for the derivation of the equations]: where  and  are incidence matrices relating records in  to the vector of fixed effects  and the vector of random additive genetic effects   respectively   is the inverse of the internal additive genetic (co)variance matrix associated with the internal genetic evaluation E that includes all internal and external animals and  is the inverse of the residual (co)variance matrix. For the approximation of   it can be shown that [See Additional file ]:   where  is the incidence matrix relating records of i external data to internal and external animals and  is the residual (co)variance matrix for the i source of external information. Thereby   is approximated by   where  is a block diagonal variance matrix with one block per animal [] [] and . Each diagonal block of  is equal to  for  =  animals  where the matrix  is a matrix of residual (co)variance among traits and the j matrix  is a diagonal matrix with elements  where  =  traits. Element RE is the effective number of records  i.e. record equivalents  for the j animal for the k trait associated with the i source [] []. Record equivalents express the quantity of contributions due to relationships and/or due to records considered for the evaluation of an animal. For internal animals  RE is equal to 0 because all contributions are only due to the relationships among external and internal animals. For external animals  if double-counting of contributions due to relationships among them is not taken into account   for the j animal for the k trait associated with the i source  where  is the heritability of the k trait [] []. If double-counting of contributions due to relationships among external animals is taken into account  RE only expresses the amount of contributions due to records and can be estimated through a two-step algorithm (TSA) []. The first step of this TSA determines external animals associated with external information that includes only contributions due to relationships. The second step estimates the amount of contributions due to records (expressed as RE) for external animals associated with information that combines both contributions due to relationships and own records. Note that the proposed approximation of  differs from the approximation proposed by Quaas and Zhang []. Indeed  they proposed to approximate each diagonal block of  by   where the matrix  is a matrix of genetic (co)variance among traits and  is a diagonal matrix with elements: Also  the multi-trait MME (1) that integrate  sources of external information differ from the usual multi-trait MME only by the terms  and : Furthermore  it was previously assumed that the whole pedigree is available for all genetic evaluations. The additive genetic (co)variance matrices that include all internal and external animals are then equal for all genetic evaluations (i.e.  ). Nevertheless  each internal or external genetic evaluation could be performed as a single-step genomic evaluation (e.g.  [] []) without modifications to the Bayesian derivation [See Additional file ] because assumptions on the different matrices  were not limiting. Such cases would lead to . For example  integration of external information provided by the usual MME into a single-step genomic evaluation would lead to  because  would include genomic information [] []  unlike . Assumptions stated in the previous section led to each source of external information to be obtained from an external evaluation that was based only on external data and free of internal data and information  as well as of the -1 other external data and information. In practice  this assumption is not necessarily valid because a source of external information may be obtained from an external evaluation based on external data and/or information and also on internal data and/or information (e.g.  EBV and associated REL obtained in country E based on external data E and on internal data E). Thus  double-counting of contributions due to records between internal and external information must be taken into account  as detailed below. For the i source of external information  internal information included into external information (subscript I) associated with the external animals can be summarized as   i.e. the vector of internal EBV associated with external animals for which external information included both external and internal information  and by   the prediction error (co)variance matrix associated with . A modified set of multi-trait mixed model equations that integrate several sources of external information and take double-counting of contributions due to records between external and internal information into account  can be written as follows [See Additional file ]: where  is a genetic (co)variance matrix for all animals for the internal information included into the i source of external information   is the vector of internal EBV associated with the i source of external information that includes internal information and  is the inverse of the prediciton error (co)variance matrix associated with  and approximated as detailed in the previous section. If the i source of external information does not include internal information for external animals  the vector  is undetermined and the matrix  is equal to . This leads to the system of equations (). Equations to blend several sources of external information by avoiding double-counting of contributions due to records among internal and external data/information can be derived from the system of equations () by assuming that  has no records (i.e. that  is an empty vector). Then  the equation can be written as follows: The system of equations () was tested using data simulated with the software package GNU Octave []. The context of the simulation was a country that imports sires from another country to generate the next generation of production animals and potential sires. Populations of the importing country (hereafter called the internal population) and of the exporting country (hereafter called the external population) were assumed to belong to the same breed. Each population included about 1000 animals distributed over five generations and was simulated from 120 female and 30 male founders. For both populations  milk yield in the first lactation was simulated for each female with progeny  following Van Vleck []. A herd effect nested within-population was randomly assigned to each phenotypic record. To obtain enough observations per level for the herd effect  each herd included at least 40 females. Phenotypic variance and heritability were assumed to be 3.24*10 kg and 0.25  respectively. To simulate the internal and external populations  the following rules were applied to generate each new generation. First  from the second generation  both females and males older than one year old were considered as mature for breeding and a male could be mated during at most two breeding years. Second  95% of the available females and 75% of the available males with the highest true breeding values were selected for breeding. Third  all selected females were randomly mated with the selected males. The maximum number of males mated to produce the next generation was set to 25. Furthermore  a mating could be performed only if the additive relationship coefficient between male and female was less than 0.5 and if the female had less than three progeny. The external population was simulated first and additional rules were applied to this population. For this population  males that were selected for mating only originated from the external population and 60% of the external male offspring with the lowest true breeding values were culled in each generation. Then  the internal population was simulated. For this population  males were selected among all available internal males and a subset of selected external sires. This subset of external sires included the first 50 sires with the highest true breeding values in the external population. Also  99% of internal male offspring with the lowest true breeding values were culled in each generation. No female offspring was culled in either population. Using the simulated data  three genetic evaluations were performed (Table ): A joint evaluation (EVAL) was performed as a BLUP evaluation using the system of equations () and based on external and internal pedigree and data. This evaluation was assumed to be the reference. An internal evaluation (EVAL) was performed as a BLUP evaluation using the system of equations () and based on internal pedigree and data. An external evaluation (EVAL) was performed as a BLUP evaluation using the system of equations () and based on external pedigree and data. Three Bayesian evaluations that integrated information provided by EVAL or by EVAL for the 50 external sires into EVAL were also performed. Because the external sires were related  double-counting of contributions due to relationships existed and this was taken into account for the three Bayesian evaluations through the TSA []. Double-counting of contributions due to records could also exist with the integration of information provided by EVAL into EVAL because EVAL and EVAL were partially based on the same data (i.e.  internal data). The following three Bayesian evaluations were performed: A Bayesian evaluation using the system of equations () and using EBV and PEV obtained from EVAL associated with the 50 external sires that were used inside the internal population as external information (EVAL). A Bayesian evaluation using the system of equations () and EBV and PEV obtained from EVAL associated with the 50 external sires as external information (hereafter called joint information) (EVAL). Although EVAL was based on external and internal data  double-counting of contributions due to records between joint and internal information was not taken into account. A Bayesian evaluation integrating joint information by using the system of equations () and taking into account double-counting of contributions due records among internal and joint information (EVAL). Double-counting of contributions due to records among internal and joint information was taken into account by using EBV and PEV obtained from EVAL associated with the 50 external sires. The simulation was replicated 100 times. Comparisons between EVAL and EVAL  EVAL  EVAL  or EVAL were performed separately for the 50 external sires and for the internal animals. Comparisons were based on: Spearman¿s rank correlation coefficients (r) of EBV obtained from EVAL (EBV) with EBV obtained from EVAL (EBV)  EVAL (EBV)  EVAL (EBV)  and EVAL (EBV)  regression coefficients (a) of EBV on EBV  EBV  EBV  and EBV  and coefficients of determination (R) associated with the regressions  the total amount of RE (RE) associated with external information  joint information and joint information corrected for the included internal information  and mean squared errors (MSE) of EBV  EBV  EBV  and EBV  expressed as a percentage of MSE obtained for EBV. For each replicate  the MSE obtained for EBV was reported to a relative value of 100 before the different computations of MSE. Because the TSA was applied before all three Bayesian evaluations  RE were free of contributions due to relationships estimated by the Bayesian evaluations. For an easier understanding of the results and discussion  RE can be transformed into daughter equivalents (DE) through []. All results were the average of the 100 replicates. Even if MACE allows the aggregation of EBV for dairy sires  internal genetic evaluations for animals not associated with MACE information (e.g.  cows  calves  young sires) are not influenced by external information considered by the MACE for dairy sires and may be still biased. Therefore  integration of MACE information into internal evaluations  as well as blending of MACE and internal information  could benefit those animals. The performance of equation () that blends MACE and internal information was evaluated in the context of the official Walloon genetic evaluation for Holstein cattle. The Walloon example used information for milk  fat and protein yields for Holstein cattle provided by the official Walloon genetic evaluation [] []. The genetic variances were those used for the official Walloon genetic evaluation [] and were equal to 280 425 kg for milk yield  to 522.6 kg for fat yield and to 261.5 kg for protein yield. The respective heritabilities were equal to 0.38  0.43 and 0.41. The pedigree file was extracted from the database used for the official Walloon genetic evaluation (EVAL) and covered up to six known ancestral generations. The extraction was performed for a randomly selected group of 1909 animals (potentially genotyped) born after 1998. The selected group included sires  cows and calves that were used or were not at the internal level. After extraction  the pedigree file contained 16 234 animals. Internal information included EBV and associated REL estimated from data provided by the Walloon Breeding Association (EBV  REL) for the EVAL for milk production of April 2013 [] []. A total of 12 046 animals were associated with an available EBV. External information included EBV and REL for 1981 sires provided with the official release for the April 2013 MACE performed by Interbull (EVAL  EBV  REL) []. It should be noted that the Walloon region in Belgium participated in the April 2013 MACE. Internal and external information were harmonized between the Walloon and MACE evaluations by adjusting scales and mean differences towards the original expression of the trait in the Walloon genetic evaluations. External information was then considered to be the same trait as the internal phenotype trait. Unlike the simulated example  no joint evaluation based on Walloon and external records was available for both external and internal animals. Because EVAL aggregated EBV from several national genetic evaluations for sires  it was considered as the reference for the evaluated sires. Walloon and MACE information were blended by using equation () for the following four cases: with or without consideration of double-counting of contributions due to relationships and with or without consideration of double-counting of contributions due to records (Table ). Double-counting of contributions due to relationships was possible because all animals associated with Walloon and/or MACE information were related. Double-counting of contributions due to records was also possible because MACE information associated with the 1981 sires included contributions provided by EVAL. Thus  to test the importance of both double-counting issues  the following four cases were evaluated: Walloon and MACE information were blended without considering double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships (EVAL  EBV  REL). Walloon and MACE information were blended by considering only double-counting of contributions due to records (EVAL  EBV  REL). To achieve this goal  the contribution of Walloon information into MACE information was determined based on the domestic effective daughter equivalents (EDC) associated with EBV and REL and provided with the official release for the 2013 April MACE by Interbull. MACE information free of Walloon information was reported by a domestic EDC equal to 0. A total of 601 sires were associated with an EDC greater than 0. For these 601 sires  EBV and associated REL estimated from Walloon data and contributing to the April 2013 MACE routine-run (EBV  REL) were considered by EVAL to take double-counting of contributions due to records into account. Double-counting of contributions due to relationships was not taken into account for either Walloon or MACE information. Walloon and MACE information were blended by only considering double-counting of contributions due to relationships among all animals (EVAL  EBV  REL). The TSA was therefore applied for Walloon and MACE information. Double-counting of contributions due to records was not considered. Walloon and MACE information were blended by considering both double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships (EVAL  EBV  REL). Reliabilities for EBV  EBV  EBV and EBV were computed using the equation   where  is the genetic variance for the corresponding trait and  is the prediction error variance obtained from the diagonal element of the inverted left-hand-side of the equation (). As explained previously  EVAL was considered as the reference for sires evaluated through EVAL. Comparisons between EVAL and EVAL  EVAL  EVAL  EVAL or EVAL were performed based on: Spearman¿s rank correlation coefficients (r) of EBV with EBV  EBV  EBV  EBV and EBV  MSE of EBV  EBV  EBV  EBV  and EVAL (i.e. mean squared errors expressed as a percentage of average MSE of EBV)  regression coefficients (a) and  R of the regressions of EVAL on the five other evaluations (i.e.  EVAL  EVAL  EVAL  EVAL and EVAL)  RE and (6) average REL. Comparisons concerned two groups of sires. A first group of sires included 1212 sires that were associated with both Walloon and MACE information and had daughters with records in the Walloon region dataset (hereafter called ¿internally used sires¿). A second group of sires included 631 sires that were associated with both Walloon and MACE information but had no daughters with records in the Walloon region dataset (i.e. they had only foreign  or external  daughters; hereafter called ¿internally unused sires¿). The RE were free of contributions due to relationships that were estimated by the Bayesian evaluations but could include contributions due to relationships that resulted from the previous genetic evaluation if the TSA was not applied. The effect of blending MACE and Walloon information was also studied for internal animals that were not associated with MACE information and that were sired by internally used sires by considering (1) r between EVAL and EVAL  EVAL  EVAL or EVAL  (2) RE and (3) average REL. Three groups of internal animals were defined depending on their REL. The first group included internal animals that were associated with a REL lower than 0.50  the second group included internal animals that were associated with a REL between 0.50 and 0.75  and the third group included internal animals with a REL equal or higher than 0.75. All blending evaluations were performed using a version of the BLUPF90 program [] modified to implement the equations ()  () and (). On average  each of the 100 simulated internal and external populations included 1048 animals. Results for r  MSE  a and R for prediction of EBV are in Table  for the 50 external sires and for the internal animals. Compared to the rankings of EVAL  integration of external or joint information for the 50 external sires led to rankings of EVAL  EVAL or EVAL that were more similar to those of EVAL. Rank correlations r increased from 0.57 for EVAL to at least 0.95 for EVAL for the 50 external sires and from 0.93 for EVAL to at least 0.98 for EVAL for internal animals (Table ). Furthermore  MSE  a and R also showed that the integration of external or joint information for the 50 external animals with EVAL  EVAL or EVAL led to better predictions of EBV for both external and internal animals (Table ). Therefore  the observations that internals animals related to the 50 external sires were also better predicted by EVAL  EVAL and EVAL  compared to EVAL  revealed that the external information propagated from the 50 external sires to relatives. The RE associated with EVAL was equal to 76.3 (which also corresponded to 381.6 DE)  while the RE associated with EVAL was equal to 141.5 (DE = 707.7  Table ). The higher RE associated with EVAL showed that double-counting of contributions due to records was present when joint information was integrated. Indeed  joint information contained both external and internal information. The RE associated with EVAL was equal to 78.7 (DE = 393.3  Table ). While this latter RE is slightly higher (i.e. 3.1% on average) than the RE associated with EVAL  it showed that double-counting was almost avoided when internal information was considered for the 50 external sires. A total of 96.4% of contributions due to records of internal information on average was removed from the joint information (Table ). The remaining 3.6% of contributions due to records of internal information was double-counted by the Bayesian evaluations and may result from the estimation of contributions due to relationships and/or from the estimation of contributions due to records among joint and internal information. Because double-counting of contributions due to records between joint and internal information was almost avoided  breeding values that were estimated by EVAL for all animals led to better predictions of EBV than EVAL  based on r  MSE  a and R (Table ). Rank correlations of EBV with EBV and EBV increased from 0.979 for EVAL to 0.996 for EVAL for the internal animals and from 0.956 for EVAL to 0.996 for EVAL for the 50 external animals. The MSE decreased on average from 34.3% for EVAL to 6.8% for EVAL for the internal animals and from 17.2% for EVAL to 0.6% for EVAL for the external animals. These results again showed that integration of external/joint information for the 50 external sires influenced the prediction of internal relatives through the propagation of information from the external sires to relatives. These results show that the double-counting of contributions due to records also affected predictions of internal animals. Furthermore  as expected  EVAL predicted EBV slightly better than EVAL for both external sires and internal animals  based on the corresponding r  MSE  a and R (Table ). The low difference in accuracy of prediction between EVAL and EVAL could be attributed to the estimation of contributions due to relationships and due to records. Based on these results  double-counting of contributions due to records was almost avoided. Thus  the integration of information into a genetic evaluation by avoiding both contributions due to relationships and due to records performed well for external animals. Internal animals also benefited of the integration of information thanks to their relationships with external animals. Of the 12 046 animals associated with available Walloon information for the three traits  6232 animals for milk yield  6209 animals for fat yield  and 6212 animals for protein yield were associated with information that was based only on contributions due to relationships  as estimated by the TSA. In terms of RE  contributions due to relationships represented from 14.9% for fat yield to 16.3% for milk yield of the contributions associated with Walloon information (Figure ). Among the 1981 sires associated with MACE information  two sires were associated with information that includes only contributions due to relationships for the three traits. Both these sires had several sons among all the sires associated with an EBV  which explains that the contributions were considered as only due to relationships. In terms of RE  all contributions due to relationships represented on average 5.1% of the contributions associated with MACE information for the three traits. Of the 601 sires with an EBV  all sires were associated with information that included both contributions due to relationships and due to records. This latter observation for the 601 sires was expected because these 601 sires must have at least 10 daughters with records within 10 herds in the Walloon region to participate in the MACE evaluation.  Percentage of contributions due to records (blue squares) and due to relationships (red squares) associated with Walloon information for all animals  internally used and unused sires and associated with MACE information for internally used and unused sires for milk (M)  fat yield (F) and protein (P) yields. Of the internally used sires  1212 had Walloon and MACE information and had both internal and external daughters with records. On average  each sire had 143.1 internal daughters with records. The average REL ranged from 0.74 to 0.76 (Table ) and the average REL was equal to 0.88 for the three traits. Results for r  MSE  a and R for prediction of EBV by EVAL are in Table  for the 1212 sires for milk  fat and protein yields. For the three traits  blending of Walloon and MACE information by taking double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships into account (i.e. EVAL) led to a ranking that was more similar to the MACE ranking than to the internal ranking (i.e. EVAL)  although these internally used sires sired a large number of cows with records in the Walloon region. Rank correlations increased by 0.104 points for milk yield to 0.125 points for fat yield to achieve a rank correlation between EBV and EBV that ranged from 0.987 to 0.990 (Table ). The MSE  a and R showed that accuracy of predictions of EBV by EBV or by EBV increased when external information was integrated. Integration of MACE information also increased the average REL by 0.14 points for fat yield to 0.16 points for milk yield (Table ). This increase of average REL corresponded to an increase of 57.5  51.4  and 50.9 DE per sire on average for milk  fat and protein yields  respectively. Also  the average REL for the 1212 sires was 0.02 points higher than the average REL (Table ). This difference in average REL  as well as the differences between EBV and EBV based on MSE  a and R (Table )  can be explained by the fact that MACE did not include all information available for animals in the Walloon region. Indeed  EBV of a sire was included into MACE if it had at least10 daughters with records within 10 herds at the internal level. Therefore  EBV for sires that did not fulfill this requirement were not considered by MACE  but were taken into account by the four Bayesian evaluations  which provided additional information compared to MACE information. Approximations based on estimation of contributions due to relationships and theoretical assumptions of the model may also explain some of the differences between EBV and EBV. For example  MACE was considered as a national genetic evaluation. These results indicate that EVAL  i.e. a Bayesian evaluation that blended internal information and external information and avoided most double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships  was successful in integrating MACE information for internally used sires. Double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships were also not considered (i.e. EVAL) or were considered separately (i.e. EVAL and EVAL) to study their influences on prediction of EVAL for internally used sires. Parameters r  a and R associated with EVAL  EVAL and EVAL for the 1212 sires were similar to the r  a and R of EVAL  although a slight advantage was observed for EVAL. Therefore  the four blending evaluations led to similar rankings as MACE for the 1212 internally used sires (i.e.  rank correlations equal to 0.99 on average; Table ). However  double-counting can be observed based on MSE  RE and REL (Table ). With regard to double-counting of contributions due to relationships for the 1212 internally used sires  RE that were free of contributions due to relationships (i.e. RE that included only contributions due to records) for EBV were equal to 30 378 (DE = 176 578) for milk yield  23 927 (DE = 150 772) for fat yield  and 26 338 (DE = 160 416) for protein yield. These amounts of RE free of contributions due to relationships represented 96.1% of the RE that contributed to MACE information. Considering the Walloon information for the 1212 sires  RE that included only contributions due to records represented from 93.6% of all Walloon contributions for milk yield to 94.2% for fat yield. For both Walloon and MACE information associated with the internally used sires and for the three traits (i.e. for milk  fat and protein yields)  less than 6.4% of all contributions were attributed to relationships (Figure ). Such low percentages of contributions due to relationships are in agreement with selection index theory []. While double-counting of contributions due to relationships was present for EVAL (i.e. the blending evaluation that considered only double-counting of contributions due to records)  the contributions due to relationships were small and their double-counting had little effect on the prediction of EBV for the internally used sires  compared to EVAL  based on parameters r and MSE. However  as expected  an average increase of 1% in REL was observed  compared to REL. Thus  the REL were  on average  slightly overestimated. With regard to double-counting of contributions due to records  based on RE  Walloon information represented from 64.3% of the total information free of contributions due to relationships associated with EVAL for milk yield to 67.6% for fat yield (Table ). Thus  integrated information free of contributions due to relationships and due to records (i.e. MACE information from which Walloon information was subtracted) represented 32.5% of the total information associated with EVAL for fat yield to 35.8% for milk yield. If double-counting of contributions due to relationships was considered only  RE associated with EVAL ranged from 43 944 RE for fat yield to 52 313 RE for milk yield  while RE associated with EVAL ranged from 29 631 RE for fat yield to 34 141 RE for milk yield. Thus  between 14 313 and 18 172 RE were considered twice by EVAL. However  double-counting of contributions due to records affected the prediction of EBV for internally used sires only slightly according to all parameters evaluated (Table ). The REL were overestimated by 1% on average for the internally used sires  compared to REL. Furthermore  no preference was observed between EVAL and EVAL based on r  MSE  a and R for the three traits. Indeed  r and R were similar for these two evaluations  while EVAL was more reliable based on MSE  but parameter a indicated that EVAL was more reliable. However  EVAL had the greatest under- and overestimation of true breeding values based on parameter a. Based on these results  it can be stated that double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records had little effect on EBV for internally used sires. Of the internally unused sires (i.e. that had only external daughters with records)  631 sires were associated with Walloon and MACE information. Their average REL ranged from 0.22 to 0.23 for the three traits (Table ) and the average REL was equal to 0.77. Because they had only external daughters  Walloon contributions only included contributions due to relationships and no contributions due to records. Based on RE (Table )  Walloon contributions due to records for all 631 sires were in general well estimated by the TSA  ranging from 0.79% of the Walloon total contributions for milk yield to 0.80% for protein yield (Figure ). The small non-zero percentage could be attributed to approximations involved in estimating the contributions due to relationships and due to records by the TSA  such as the consideration of an unknown fixed effect []. The nearly correct estimation of contributions due to relationships led to similar average REL and average REL for the three traits (Table ). Integration of MACE information also increased the average REL by at least 0.54 points  resulting in an average REL equal to 0.77 for the three traits. These results for the 631 internally unused sires confirmed that MACE information already contained the main contributions due to relationships that were expressed in the Walloon information and that double-counting of contributions due to relationships was mostly avoided. Not considering contributions due to relationships (i.e. EVAL and EVAL) led to overestimation of average REL by at least 3% (Table ). Results for r  MSE  a and R for the prediction of EBV by the four blending evaluations are in Table  for the 631 internally unused sires for the three traits. Blending of Walloon and MACE information led to similar rankings of the 631 sires for the four blending evaluations. Rank correlations between EBV and EBV for the four blending evaluations increased from 0.73 to 0.99 for milk yield  from 0.57 to 0.99 for fat yield and from 0.72 to 0.99 for protein yield. These rank correlations indicated that the blending method was also successful for sires with only external information for all three traits. These results were confirmed by a decrease of MSE by at least 96.9% and by regression coefficients close to 1.0  with an R equal to 0.99 for all three traits (Table ). Because double-counting can be only attributed to contributions due to relationships for the 631 internally unused sires  EVAL and EVAL led to similar parameters. This was also observed for EVAL and EVAL (Table ). Differences between these two groups of evaluations were only observed based on MSE and a (Table ). These two parameters showed that EBV for the 631 sires were slightly better predicted when contributions due to relationships were considered. However  all these results showed that contributions due to relationships had little effect on the prediction of EBV. VanRaden and Tooker [] found similar correlations between EBV and combined EBV for sires with only external daughters (i.e. between 0.991 and 0.994 for yield traits). Their strategy consisted of computing external deregressed proofs (DRP) from EBV and including one extra record based on these DRP  weighted by the associated DE for the sire. Internal contributions in MACE information for sires with internal and external daughters were considered by subtracting the number of internal DE from the total and by using internal EBV instead of parent averages from EBV to compute external DRP. Based on Legarra et al. []  Gengler and Vanderick [] integrated MACE information into the official Walloon genetic evaluation for milk production. External EBV were estimated by selection index theory and internal contributions were considered as in VanRaden and Tooker []. Thus  while these two latter approaches and the approach proposed in this study consider internal contributions to MACE information in a similar manner [See Additional file ]  the main advantage of the proposed approach is to avoid a pre-processing deregression step or computation of external EBV. The effect of the integration of MACE information on predictions was also studied for internal animals that were not associated with MACE information and that were sired by internally used sires. A total of 3331 internal animals was considered. If double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records were avoided (i.e. EVAL)  integration of MACE information led to an increase of the REL from 0.32 to 0.42 for milk yield and from 0.31 to 0.42 for fat and protein yields for internal animals that had a REL less than 0.50 (Table ). These increases were equivalent to 2.4 DE for milk yield  2.3 DE for fat yield and 2.4 DE for protein yield. On average  no increase in REL was observed for internal animals with REL greater than 0.50 (Tables  and ; Figure ). Therefore  integration of MACE information was mostly relevant for external animals that were associated with this information and for internal animals with a low REL sired by external animals.  Reliabilities associated with the Bayesian evaluation that considers double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records (REL) as a function of reliabilities associated with the official Walloon evaluation (REL) for the 3331 internal animals sired by internally used sires (i.e.  having daughters with records in the Walloon Region) for milk yield. The effect of double-counting was also studied in comparison to EVAL for the 3331 internal animals that were only associated with Walloon information and that were sired by internally used sires. Own contributions due to relationships for internal animals with REL less than 0.50 represented from 85.2% of the total contributions for milk yield to 91.8% for fat yield (Table ). These percentages ranged from 55.1% for protein yield to 57.7% for fat yield for internal animals with REL between 0.50 and 0.75  and from 15.4% for protein yield to 16.7% for fat yield for internal animals with REL greater than 0.75 (Tables  and ). As stated before  these observations were as expected based on selection index theory []  and double-counting of own contributions due to relationships was mostly present for internal animals with low REL. However  internal animals were also affected by double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records that originated from their sires (and relatives) through the contributions due to relationships. Double-counting that originated from their own contributions and from their sires (and relatives) could be observed based on a comparison of REL  REL and REL and of r between EBV and EBV or EBV (Tables    and ). Double-counting of contributions due to records that originated from sires of internal animals had minor effects on the average REL associated with internal animals (at most 1%) and rankings of internal animals (r = 0.999; Tables    and ). However  double-counting of contributions due to relationships led to an increase of average REL by at least 0.14 points for internal animals with REL less than 0.50 and by at least 0.11 points for internal animals with REL ranging from 0.50 to 0.74. The increase of average REL was lower for internal animals with REL greater than 0.75 (>0.02 points; Tables    and ). Although the average REL and REL were (slightly) overestimated for both evaluations  double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships had little effect on the ranking of internal animals compared to the ranking of EVAL  regardless of the group of internal animals or trait considered. Indeed  rank correlations between EVAL and EVAL or EVAL were greater than 0.99 (Tables    and ). All these results show that double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records can be ignored for the prediction of EBV for internal animals that are sired by external animals. However  all double-counting must be taken into account to estimate REL accurately. Considering all groups of animals  i.e. internally used and unused sires  as well as internal animals sired by internally used sires  our results for the Walloon example suggest that contributions due to relationships can be ignored. Indeed  the different rank correlations for EVAL (i.e. the Bayesian evaluation that took only double-counting of contributions due to records into account) were similar to the rank correlations of EVAL. Furthermore  in practice  the TSA could be difficult to apply if a high number of animals is associated with external information because it requires the inversion of a  potentially  dense matrix for each iteration. However  effects of double-counting of contributions due to relationships should be tested before ignoring it. For example  overestimation of REL could occur especially for traits for which contributions due to relationships would be at least as significant as contributions due to records (e.g.  if the phenotypes are expensive to obtain). Furthermore  REL associated with the modified MME were estimated based on the inverted LHS. Although this was feasible for the simulated and Walloon data  this may not be feasible in most cases  and approaches that estimate REL (e.g.  [] []) could be modified to take into account RE (or DE) associated with external information. The Walloon example was considered as an evaluation that blends MACE and Walloon (internal) information in the context of official Walloon genetic evaluations for Holstein cattle. However  the Walloon example can also be considered as a particular case of an internal evaluation that has no internal data and blends only sources of external information  i.e. MACE and Walloon information  that are partially based on the same information  i.e. the Walloon information. This case can be extended to more general cases for which internal data may exist and external animals are associated with at least two sources of information (e.g.  E and E) that are partially based on the same external records or information. Double-counting of external information that is shared by the sources of external information  e.g. E and E  can be avoided by the proposed approach thanks to the knowledge and availability of EBV and associated REL that are based only on external information that is shared by the sources of external information. Nevertheless  although taking external information that is shared by different sources of external information into consideration seems to be possible with the proposed approach  this may be difficult in practice because it requires that EBV and associated REL based on shared external information are known and available. The proposed unified method integrated and blended several sources of information into an internal genetic evaluation in an appropriate manner. The results also showed that the proposed method was able to avoid double-counting of contributions due to records and due to relationships. Furthermore  because all available external sources of information were correctly propagated  relatives of external animals benefited from integrated information and  therefore  received more reliable EBV. The unified method could also be used in the context of single-step genomic evaluations to integrate external information to indirectly recover a large amount of external phenotypic information []. While the simulated and Walloon examples were univariate  the unified method was developed for multi-trait models that  e.g.  allow evaluation of only internally available traits (e.g.  methane emissions  fine milk composition traits  such as fatty acids  milk proteins and other minor components)  using additional external information from correlated traits (e.g.  traits evaluated by Interbull).

Including data from distant breeds in a reference population had a neutral to slightly negative effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction. Accounting for differences in marker allele frequencies between breeds had only a small effect on the accuracy of genomic prediction from crossbred or combined crossbred and purebred reference populations. Genomic prediction refers to the prediction of genetic merit of selection candidates based on genome-wide marker genotypes using information from a reference population of individuals with both phenotypes and genotypes []. Accuracy of genomic prediction depends largely on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers and QTL (quantitative trait loci) and the number of animals in the reference population [] []. Theoretical predictions of GBV (genomic breeding values) accuracy usually consider homogenous populations  whereas in many cases  such as in sheep and beef cattle breeding programs  data are available from different breeds  multiple strains within a breed and also from crossbred animals. According to theory  the improvement in accuracy of GBV for a specific breed based on using data from other breeds or crossbreds depends on the consistency of linkage phase between QTL and genetic markers across breeds and also on the similarity of QTL effects between breeds. Simulation results have shown either some [] or no significant increase [] [] in prediction accuracy for a single breed when using a combined multi-breed reference population. For a given reference population size  Ibanez -Escriche . [] reported similar prediction accuracy for a single breed when using either purebreds or crossbreds in a reference population  while Toosi . [] reported slightly lower prediction accuracy from crossbreds than purebreds. These simulation results depend on the assumptions made about the underlying genetic model and the degree of LD that exists within and across breeds. Analysis of real data has shown that information from other breeds generally does not increase the prediction accuracy of a given breed at a 50 k marker density in dairy cattle []-[]  beef cattle [] or sheep [] []. These results suggest that LD between markers and putative QTL mostly does not extend across breeds at a 50 k marker density. In a combined purebred and crossbred reference population  genomic predictions for a particular breed can be based on purebred data  on crossbred data  or on a combination of these. The question is how the use of data from multiple breeds affects prediction accuracies for a given breed. Adding information from unrelated breeds could have no impact  but the effect could also be negative  as marker effects may be averaged across breeds and marker allele frequencies may differ between breeds. The latter could also affect genomic relationships that are derived for genomic prediction. Furthermore  the contribution of using only crossbred animals for genomic prediction  which in some cases may be the only source of information  on the accuracy of genomic prediction of purebred individuals has not been addressed using real data. The objective of this study was to assess empirically and systematically the accuracy of genomic prediction based on purebred and crossbred data. The accuracy of genomic prediction was compared when using data from purebreds  from crossbreds  or from a combination of purebreds and crossbreds. Furthermore  we studied the effect of accounting for differences in marker allele frequencies between breeds on the accuracy of genomic prediction. The reference populations were data subsets extracted from a large reference population. The total reference population consisted of two research datasets known as the Sheep Cooperative Research Centre Information Nucleus Flock (INF) and the Sheep Genomics Flock (SGF). The INF consisted of nine flocks located across different sheep production regions in Australia that were linked by using common sires through artificial insemination. The SGF was a single research flock located in southern New South Wales  Australia. Both flocks used around 40% of sires from terminal breeds (Poll Dorset: PD and White Suffolk: WS)  20% sires from maternal breeds (Border Leicester: BL) and 40% Merino sires. Most dams used were purebred Merino (80%) or F1 crosses between Merino and BL (20%). The purebred Merino dams were used mainly in crosses with purebred Merino sires or BL sires. The crossbred dams were mated to PD or WS sires. As a result  the majority of progeny data were crossbreds and the main breed of purebred progeny was Merino. The complete reference population consisted of 10 772 animals genotyped and measured for the traits evaluated in this study. These animals were from 326 paternal half-sib families that varied in size from 10 to 216. Flock management and phenotypic recording schedules were similar across flocks. Furthermore  all data was acquired by ¿Sheep Cooperative Research Centre¿ and ¿Sheep Genomics Australia¿ under protocols that all had obtained appropriate ethical approval. Results of genomic prediction based on complete reference population are available in []. More information on the design of the INF and SGF research flocks is available in Van der Werf . [] and White . []  respectively. Previous studies based on this data used the complete reference population consisting of multiple breeds [] []. Our current study was based on well-designed subsets of that data to allow clear comparisons of reference populations based on purebreds and combinations of purebred and two-breed crosses. We used a reference population of 1000  2000 or 3000 purebred Merinos of both sexes  which were randomly chosen from a total of more than 4500 purebred Merinos across all resource flocks. We added data on crossbred progeny of BL sires and Merino dams (BL*M) or on crossbreds of PD and Merino dams (PD*M) or on crossbreds of WS sires and Merino dams (WS*M). There were not enough purebred BL  PD or WS animals to establish a purebred reference population for those breeds and subsets of crossbred progeny had maximum proportions of haplotypes from BL  PD or WS breeds. Breed proportions were derived using a deep pedigree (four to six generations) and were fitted in the analysis model for genomic prediction. The criterion for selecting animals as crossbreds in the reference population was to have breed proportions of at least 45% for BL  45% for PD  or 35% for WS. The threshold for WS crossbreds was somewhat lower to obtain sufficient numbers of animals in this group. The traits investigated were post-weaning weight (PWWT)  post-weaning scanned eye muscle depth (PW-EMD) and post-weaning scanned fat (PW-FAT) measured between 125 and 300 days of age (standard deviation or SD = 52.4). Purebred Merinos were generally measured at an older age. Measurement of traits was performed based on defined recording schedules for the SGF and INF projects [] []. Records more than 4 SD from the phenotypic mean of all records were removed. Table  shows averages of phenotypic performance for the Merino and crossbred animals. A separate population was used to evaluate the accuracy of genomic predictions (Table ). These were purebred industry sires with accurate estimated breeding values (Australian Sheep Breeding Values  ASBV) based on phenotypes on their progeny. ASBV were estimated based on BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) using phenotypic and pedigree information of industry flocks and excluding phenotypic information from the reference population. A similar fitting model was used in the calculation of ASBV. The minimum required accuracy (as derived from the prediction error variance and representing the correlation between predicted and true breeding value) of an industry sire¿s ASBV to be included in the validation population was 0.64 for WS and 0.70 for other breeds. Table  shows the minimum  maximum  average and standard deviation of the accuracy of the ASBV for different breeds. Animals from the reference and validation populations were genotyped using the 50 k Ovine SNP chip (Illumina Inc.  SanDiego  CA  USA). The total number of SNP genotypes provided by this chip was 54 241  which decreased to 48 599 after applying quality control on genotyping data. Individual SNP genotype records were removed for call rates less than 95%  GenCal (GC) scores less than 0.6  and all genotypes for a given SNP were removed if the heterozygosity for the SNP deviated more than 3 SD from the population average heterozygosity  if the minor allele frequency was less than 0.01  for SNPs located on chromosomes X and Y and for SNPs that significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 10). Furthermore  an individual sample was removed if the correlation of the genotypes (coded 0  1 or 2 per locus) with another sample was equal or greater than 0.99. Following quality control  missing SNP genotypes within an animal were imputed using the Beagle software program []. Accuracies for GBV were calculated based on the correlation between GBV and ASBV for each trait in the validation population  separately for each breed (within-breed genomic prediction). Differences in accuracies resulting from different reference populations were tested using the Z-test statistic following []. GBV were calculated based on genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP)  replacing the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix with a genomic relationship matrix [] [] based on marker genotypes. The following linear model was fitted using ASReml-3 software []. In this model   is a vector of phenotypes   is a vector of fixed effects   is a vector of random additive genetic effects   is a vector of random maternal effects (fitted only for PWW)   is a vector of breed effects   is a vector with sire by flock interaction effects and  is a vector of random residual effects.    and  and  are incidence matrices relating fixed  additive genetic  maternal  and sire by flock interaction effects to phenotypes.  is a matrix with breed proportions for each animal. All random effects were assumed identically and independently distributed except for g  which was assumed distributed as:  where  is a genomic relationship matrix and  is the additive genetic variance. The fixed effects in the model were birth type  rearing type  gender  age at measurement  weight at measurement (fitted only for PW-EMD and PW-FAT) and contemporary group  which was defined as a cohort of site x birth year x management group  i.e. a group of lambs raised together in a flock. The genomic relationship matrix () used in GBLUP was calculated according to two methods  using Van Raden¿s algorithm []. In the first method (G1)  the  was calculated based on genotypes and the observed marker allele frequencies of all animals in the reference population based on the following equation:  1 = '/2 S ()(1 - ). In this equation  =  - 2   is the number of the second allele carried by animal  for SNP   i.e. marker genotypes were represented as 0  1 and 2  and  is the frequency of the second allele for SNP . In the second method (G2)  the  was calculated based on haplotypes and using allele frequencies that pertain to the breed of each parental haplotype  to take into account different marker allele frequencies between breeds in crossbred data. We used crossbred data only on animals whose parents were more than 97% purebred  using information from a very deep pedigree. A haplotype was considered as all SNP alleles inherited from one parent.  was calculated based on a gametic model version of Van Raden¿s algorithm []  using  2 = ( 2 +  2)/2 in which  and  refer to the  calculated based on each parental haplotype. Matrices  and  were calculated using the following equation:  where  refers to the  based on the paternal  or maternal  haplotype   =  -   and  is the element of the incidence matrix (0/1) indicating the allele inherited for SNP  in the paternal or maternal haplotype for animal . Matrices  were calculated using average frequencies of alleles present in that haplotype. To calculate  we derived phased genotypes using Beagle software program [] or a pedigree-based software program that uses the half-sib structure of the data []. The latter algorithm is expected to derive the parental origin of haplotypes more reliably than Beagle. Tables    and  show the accuracies of genomic prediction for the validation sires based on different reference populations for PWWT  PW-EMD and PW-FAT  respectively. The accuracies are reported for Merinos and the other main breeds and also for the two methods of calculating the  (G1 and G2). Accuracies based on G2 using the two different phasing approaches were nearly identical. Thus  only results for G2 based on Beagle haplotypes are shown. The GBV accuracy of Merino sires increased consistently with the size of the purebred Merino reference population for all three traits (Tables    and ). The GBV accuracy of Merino sires was higher for PWWT (ranging from 0.53 to 0.59) than for the other two traits (ranging from 0.23 to 0.45 for PW-EMD and PW-FAT). The GBV accuracy of Merino sires when predicted from crossbred Merinos increased when data from purebred Merinos were added to the reference population. However  the accuracies were significantly lower compared to prediction from a similar number of purebred Merino haplotypes. For example  the GBV accuracy of PWWT based on 1000 to 3000 purebred Merinos ranged from 0.53 to 0.59 but ranged from only 0.41 to 0.54 when based on crossbred Merinos combined with those purebred Merinos (Table ). This trend was observed for all three traits investigated but the difference was largest for PW-FAT. None of the traits had significant differences in GBV accuracies for Merino sires when prediction was based on different types of crossbred reference populations (BL*Merino  PD*Merino or WS*Merino) when the number of Merino breed haplotypes available in the reference population was similar. Accuracies also were not different for the two GRM methods. There were some differences in accuracy between  and  for Merino sires based on prediction from combined purebred and crossbred Merinos  but there was no consistent pattern to these differences. The GBV accuracy of BL  PD and WS sires was generally highest when the prediction was based on crossbreds only (Tables    and ). Note that there were no purebred animals in the reference populations for these breeds. For PWWT in BL sires with the  matrix  adding data from purebred Merinos to crossbred data resulted in a significant reduction in accuracy  from 0.31 to 0.26 (Table ). A reduction of similar magnitude  from 0.29 to 0.22  was also observed for PD sires with the  matrix (Table )  while there was only a small but significant reduction in accuracy for PW-FAT in BL sires  from 0.20 to 0.17 (Table ). Apart from these cases  there was no significant reduction in accuracy when adding purebred Merino data (Tables     and ). Accuracies for BL  PD and WS sires were close to 0 for all traits when genomic prediction was based on purebred Merinos only (Tables    and ). Figure  shows a plot of the first and second principal components from the genomic relationship matrix ()  displaying values only for purebred Merino  BL  PD and WS validation sires. The figure shows that genetically the Merino breed is quite distinct from the other breeds (BL  PD and WS)  while the genetic differences between PD and WS are small.  BL = Border Leicester  PD = Poll Dorset  WS = White Suffolk  Mer = Merino. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of genomic prediction for purebred sires based on purebred  crossbred  or combined purebred and crossbred reference populations. The results showed higher accuracy for predictions based on purebred data compared to crossbred data when the same number of haplotypes of that breed was present in the reference population  and very low to zero prediction accuracy when data was from another breed. Furthermore  the prediction accuracy tended to be the same or lower when data that contain haplotypes from other breeds were added. Nevertheless the results confirmed crossbreds of the target breed can be used in genomic prediction of purebred animals which is useful when purebred information is limited  or when the breeding objective is to improve crossbred performance. When predicting the GBV of purebreds  one would expect that data on crossbred animals of the target breed would provide less information than the same amount of data on purebreds from that breed  simply because the crossbreds (at least first crosses) contain only half the number of haplotypes of that breed. However  we found the accuracy from crossbreds to be lower also after accounting for the number of haplotypes  i.e. twice the number of crossbreds gave lower accuracy than purebreds. This may be because the Merino sires of the purebred Merino reference population are more related to the validation sires than the Merino ewes used as dams of crossbreds and hence the paternal haplotypes in Merino purebreds would be more informative in the prediction of GBV of the validation sires than the same number of maternal haplotypes in crossbreds. The mean and standard deviation of genomic relationships between paternal Merino haplotypes and the Merino validation set were 0.012 and 0.026  respectively  compared to 0.004 and 0.023 for maternal haplotypes. In our data  the dams of animals with records in the reference population were often breeding ewes from research flocks  whereas the sires were generally selected based on their relevance for commercial breeding flocks []. Another explanation could be that effects of QTL are not the same in crossbreds as they are in purebreds. Various studies have pointed out that the correlation between purebred and crossbred performance can be less than 1 due to dominance and allele frequency differences between breeds [] []. In our study  we were unable to distinguish between these two possible explanations  since these two effects were confounded. However  we expect that in many cases the paternal haplotypes were more informative than the maternal haplotypes because on average they were more closely related to the selection candidates and data from n purebred animals would then give a higher GBV prediction accuracy than data from 2n crossbreds where only the maternal haplotypes contributed to the prediction of GBV of a breed. The reduction in GBV accuracy after adding data from another breed or from crossbreds to the reference population could also be explained by differences in marker effects between breeds as a result of differences in QTL-marker phase due to lack of LD between breeds  differences in QTL allele frequencies or different QTL effects in different breeds  in which the latter could possibly be also due to dominance and epistatic effects. These factors could lead to averaging of marker effects across breeds  resulting in less additive genetic variation explained than when effects are estimated within breed. Figure  shows Merinos are genetically distant from maternal (BL) and terminal breeds (PD and WS)  increasing the possibility that both marker-QTL LD and QTL effects differ between Merino and the other breeds. Figure  also shows that terminal breeds are genetically closer to each other than to Merinos and BL. These results are consistent with the small positive prediction ability (with an accuracy of 0.08 for WS and of 0.12 for PD sires for PWW) we observed in an extra analysis based on prediction from crossbred PD*Merino and WS*Merino  respectively. Our results also showed that adding information from crossbreds that include distant breeds to a purebred reference population can in some cases lead to reduced accuracies. In addition to breeds having different QTL effects and marker-QTL LD  this could be explained by marker allele frequencies being different between breeds. If the GRM is based on average allele frequencies across breeds  then the genomic relationships within a breed could change if the GRM is derived from a multi-breed instead of the purebred population. Thus  rather than unrelated individuals providing no information  as in regular pedigree-based BLUP  adding animals from different breeds to a genomic evaluation could have a negative effect on accuracy. Figure  illustrates considerable differences in allele frequencies between the Merino and Border Leicester breeds. Using specific allele frequencies according to breed-origin of haplotypes  as was used in   could potentially alleviate this problem. However   on average provided similar prediction accuracies as . Hence  using breed-specific allele frequencies in constructing the GRM had a limited impact on prediction accuracy. Makgahlela [] also reported no differences in the accuracy of genomic evaluation when adjusting the GRM for breed-specific allele frequency. This may be because the majority of marker allele frequencies are intermediate. The correlation between elements of  and  was 0.94.                                                  Our results  which are based on a 50 k marker density  suggest that different marker effects were estimated when using information from different breeds  which could be because of different marker-QTL LD or different QTL effects between breeds. This was also inferred by Daetwyler [] and Moghaddar [] based on analysis of the complete reference population consisting of multiple breeds. Results of this study confirm those findings by using a more specific design with comparisons based on only purebreds or purebreds combined with two-breed crosses in the reference population. Results reported for dairy and beef cattle []-[] show no or a very limited increase in accuracy of within-breed genomic prediction when adding data from other breeds. It should be noted that these studies usually refer to data on purebreds from various breeds  whereas in our study we combined purebred and crossbred data. Furthermore  the Bovine-50 k SNP marker panel may provide different LD patterns across dairy and beef cattle breeds than the Ovine-50 k SNP chip does for sheep breeds. However  the general pattern that emerges from these studies is that  based on 50 k marker density genotypes  genomic predictions derived from same-breed haplotypes can be informative for genomic prediction of purebreds  whether they exist in purebreds or crossbreds  whereas haplotypes from distant breeds provide no to very low information for genomic prediction of animals from a given breed. Marker panels with a higher density may provide higher LD and may overcome the problem of different marker-QTL LD between breeds. However  QTL effects may still differ between breeds  and between purebreds and crossbreds. Large numbers of phenotypes are required to estimate and test these differences. The accuracy of genomic prediction in purebred Merinos in this study was higher than theoretical predictions using Goddard¿s methods []  assuming 1000 to 3000 purebred Merinos in the reference population and an effective population size of 833 []. For example  the accuracy of PWW based on predictions from a reference population of 3000 Merinos was 0.59  compared to theoretical values of accuracy between 0.25 and 0.30. This suggests that the effective size of the Merino population in our sample is lower than 833. However  estimating effective population size in a breed like Merino sheep is problematic due to its heterogeneous nature and the existence of various strains within the breed. We also observed that the increase in accuracy from increasing the reference population was lower than expected based on theoretical prediction  which may also be explained by population substructures  including families and strains with the Merino breed. Variation between families and strains can be easily explained by genomic information  although in many cases it can also be estimated from pedigree. Substantial strain effects exist within the Merino breed (varying from ultra-fine wool types to strong wool and dual-purpose types)  especially for weight and wool traits. This additional variation due to population substructure can inflate estimates of accuracy  at least when they are interpreted as within-strain accuracy. However  in this study  trends of the change in accuracy from adding data from crossbreds  as reported in Tables    and   were similar when strain effects were accounted for in the calculation of the correlation between GBV and progeny test ASBV in the validation set  suggesting that differences in accuracy observed between different combinations of animals in the reference set were not affected by underlying population substructure. The results of this study show zero to small negative effects on genomic prediction accuracy in Australian sheep breeds when data from distant breeds were included in the reference population used to develop genomic predictions. This means that for predictions based on intermediate marker density (50 k) and GBLUP  it is currently necessary to use breed-specific reference populations. This problem might decrease when marker panels with higher density are used. However  information from crossbreds of the target breed can be used in genomic prediction of purebred animals  and this is particularly useful when there is limited information on purebreds.

Thanks to the DNA test developed in this study  breeders of non-Poitou breeds will have the opportunity to identify long-hair carriers in their breeding stocks. The hair growth cycle in mammals is composed of three phases: anagen  when follicles grow and hair is synthetized; catagen  when follicles regress; and telogen  when follicles are inactive []. Hair growth is regulated by several cytokines and growth factors  including members from the fibroblast growth factors family (FGF) and their receptors. Eighteen mammalian FGF have been described that exhibit a variety of activities  among which paracrine factors that are involved in tissue patterning and organogenesis during embryogenesis and endocrine factors that are involved in metabolism homeostasis during adulthood []. Among the members of the FGF family  FGF5 was first described as a human oncogene [] and was later shown to be involved in the dual-mode regulation of the hair growth cycle [] []. In rats and mice  alternative splicing of  transcripts results in a full-length form of FGF5 and a short form that lacks the sequences encoded by exon 2 and most of exon 3 [] []. Functionally  it was demonstrated that the full-length FGF5 induces catagen  a function that is antagonized by the short form during anagen []. Indeed  the  mouse mutant carries a 2-kb loss-of-function deletion in  and displays a delayed catagen onset and excessively long truncal hair []. Loss-of-function mutations associated with long-hair phenotypes have been described in several mammalian species including mice [] []  dogs [] [] and cats [] []  which support a conserved role of FGF5 in the regulation of hair growth. Among   the Poitou donkey breed (Baudet du Poitou) displays a long-hair coat. This breed originated from the Poitou region of France and was originally developed to produce a large type of working mules with the Poitevin Mulassier draft horse. The exact origin of the Poitou breed is unknown  probably dating back to before 1884 when the studbook was created in France. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  thousands of Poitou mules were produced and exported to Europe. After World War II  draft animals were replaced by engines and mule production began to drop off. In 1977  the breed was endangered with only 44 Poitou donkeys (20 males and 24 females) registered in France. Thus  an efficient breeding program was set up to save the breed  which led to the reconstitution of a larger breeding stock. In 2005  82 jacks and 355 jennets were used in breeding schemes (). Poitou is recognized as a large-sized donkey breed with a long-hair coat. When Poitou donkeys are left ungroomed  their coat retains very long hair that becomes matted and tangled and then grows down into a great coat. We hypothesized that the long-hair phenotype in the Poitou breed could result from loss-of-function mutations in the  gene. Here  we report the precise identification of two loss-of-function alleles in  that are fully associated with the long-hair phenotype in the panel of animals analysed when they are present as composite or homozygous recessive mutations. One hundred and two donkeys from seven breeds were included in the study. They were all sampled in France from September 2012 to October 2013 and originated from Poitou (n = 35)  Bourbonnais (n = 2)  Cotentin (n = 10)  Berry Black (n = 8)  Normand (n = 18)  Provence (n = 16) and Pyrenean (n = 13) breeds. All the animals anlysed were included at the owner¿s request. Pictures  buccal swabs and hair samples were sent directly by the owners or collected by a certified veterinarian (MA). DNA samples from 131 horses and ponies previously collected for DNA identification purposes were used as controls. The panel included 40 thoroughbred  33 French saddlebred  26 Arab horses and eight Connemara  one Icelandic  seven Haflinger  seven French  three Pottok and six Shetland ponies. All animals were client-owned animals  which underwent no invasive sampling procedure  thus  no authorization for animal experiment was required according to the legal definition in Europe (Subject 5f of Article1  Chapter I of the Directive 2010/63/UE of the European Parliament and of the Council). DNA was extracted from buccal swabs or hair roots using a Maxwell® 16 Instrument (Promega Corporation  Madison  USA)  according to the manufacturer¿s protocols. When this project was initiated  the donkey genome sequence was not yet released []. Thus  reference genome sequences were based on the equine genome sequence (Equine  gene  [Ensembl:ENSECAG00000015710]). PCR and sequencing primers were designed using Primer3 []. Exon 1 was amplified using  exon1 F 5’-AGCGCCGAGATCCGTTC-3’ and  exon1 R 5’-GGACGGGTTTTGGAGGAG-3’ primers. Exon 2 was amplified using  exon2F 5’-TGCAGTAATAAAGAATGGGAAG-3’ and  exon2R 5’-TGCATTCCATTCTACAAACG-3’ primers. Exon 3 was amplified using  exon3F 5’-GCCCATGGAATTCTTGGTTC-3’ and  exon3R 5’-GCTGAAGCTGTGTCCAAAAGTG-3’ primers. A more detailed description of PCR and sequencing primers is provided in Additional file : Table S1. PCR amplicons were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions using the Sanger method (GATC Biotech AG  Konstanz  Germany)  and electropherograms were manually inspected with Chromas Lite (Technelysium Pty Ltd  South Brisbane  Australia). Multiple alignments were performed using Multalin []. The genotype of the  c.433_434delAT deletion was determined using a pyrosequencing method adapted from Ahmadian et al. [] on a PyroMark Q96 ID pyrosequencer (Qiagen  Hilden  Germany) and the following forward and reverse PCR primers for  c.433-434delAT: 5’-AATACGAGGAGTTTTCAGCAACAA-3’ and 5’-BIOTIN-CTTGCATGGAGTTTTCCTTTTT-3’  and the sequencing primer 5’-AGCAACAAATTTTTAGCG-3’. The genotype of the  c.245G > A SNP was determined using the same method and the following forward and reverse PCR primers :5’-TTGGAGCAGGGCAGTTTC-3’ and 5’-BIOTIN-TTGCCATCCGGGTAGATC -3’ and the sequencing primer 5’-CAGGGCAGTTTCCAG-3’. A more detailed description of genotyping primers is provided in Additional file : Table S2. The Ensembl sequence of equine FGF5 was used [Ensembl:ENSECAP00000013338]. Multiple alignments were performed using Multalin []. The potential negative impact of missense mutations was assessed using the HumVar-trained version of PolyPhen-2. This version is designed to distinguish between mutations with drastic effects and other variations including abundant mildly deleterious alleles []. Because the 3D-structure of FGF5 has not been experimentally resolved  homology modeling and fold recognition were performed using the Phyre server [] and human FGF1  FGF2  FGF9  FGF10 and FGF20 as templates. Genomic coding sequences of  from Berry Black (short-hair) and Poitou (long-hair) donkeys () were submitted to GenBank. Accession numbers are [GenBank: KJ725176] for the wild type short-hair allele  [GenBank: KJ725177] for the c.433_434delAT allele and [GenBank: KJ725178] for the c.245G > A allele. The long-hair phenotype  which is very common in some domestic animals such as dogs and cats  is seldom observed in  with the exception of the French Poitou donkey breed. Poitou donkeys are characterized by their large size and shaggy coat that is caused by long  soft hair arranged in long cords when ungroomed (Figure ). Segregation analysis showed that long-hair is a recessive trait in donkeys. Indeed  F1 Poitou crossbred donkeys and mules are always short-haired. With the aim of providing breeders with an accurate DNA-based test to detect long-hair carriers in Poitou crossbred descendants  we performed a mutation screening of  in various donkey breeds. Apart from comparative cytogenetic maps  whole-genome mapping tools are still lacking for this species [] []. Indeed  the SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array that was developed for the horse genome [] [] is of little use for domestic donkeys  with a cross-species validation rate of 5.6 × 10 for the 53k SNP array []. Thus  to circumvent these limitations  we screened long-haired donkeys for mutations in the  gene  which is the most relevant candidate gene to explain this variation in coat length. To cover the three exons and their respective intron-exon flanking sequences  we designed three sets of intron primers using the equine  Ensembl sequence.  Poitou donkeys exhibit lifelong hair growth with young animals usually showing a medium-sized coat with short-hair areas  and adult donkeys showing a long matted and tangled coat . First  a panel composed of three long-haired Poitou donkeys and two short-haired Berry Black control donkeys was used. The three sets of primers yielded amplicons at the right size  and sequencing confirmed that  sequences were successfully amplified. Global alignement revealed 99.7% similarity between the equine and donkey  coding sequences  which confirmed that the two genes are orthologous. Furthermore  pair-wise base-to-base comparisons of sequences between donkeys and the horse reference sequence revealed two interspecific variants  one SNP and a two-base pair deletion from the individuals of this first panel (Table ). Careful analysis of the two interspecific variants revealed that they consisted of a synonymous mutation and a non-synonymous mutation  which based on PolyPhen-2 prediction has no impact on FGF5 function (L223S; score 0.00). On the contrary  the donkey SNP is a nonsense mutation (c.245G > A) that leads to a stop codon at position 82 in FGF5 and the two-base pair deletion (c.433_434delAT) produces a frameshift that results in a stop codon at position 159 in FGF5 (Table ). In a second series of experiments  the complete cohort composed of 102 donkeys representing seven breeds was genotyped for the c.245G > A SNP and the c.433_434delAT deletion. Among the 35 long-haired Poitou donkeys  31 were homozygous for the  mutated allele containing the c.433_434delAT deletion  while four Poitou  two Pyrenean  one Normand and one Bourbonnais donkeys were heterozygous. The remaining 63 short-haired donkeys were homozygous for the wild type reference allele (Table ). Thus  we genotyped 131 short-haired ponies and horses from nine breeds but did not identify the deletion in this panel (Table )  which supports the association (chi-square test  p = 2.62 × 10) between the Poitou deletion and the long-haired phenotype of this breed. To check whether the four Poitou individuals that were identified as heterozygous for the deletion were compound heterozygotes  we determined the genotypes of the cohort at the c.245G > A SNP. Indeed the four c.433_434delAT heterozygous Poitou individuals were also heterozygous for the c.245G > A nonsense mutation (Table ). Ninety-three donkeys were homozygous for the wild type reference allele  and interestingly the five remaining donkeys from the cohort (one Berry Black  one Normand  one Pyrenean and two Provence) carried a copy of the mutant allele (Table ). As stated above  the c.433_434delAT deletion induces a frameshift that leads to a premature stop codon at position 159 in the protein. To evaluate the putative functional impact of the c.433_434delAT deletion on FGF5  3D models were built using the Phyre server [] and five human FGF proteins as templates. The models predicted that the truncated protein lacked seven of the 12 ß-strands that define the canonical FGF trefoil (Figure ; [])  which supports the hypothesis that the c.433_434delAT deletion can impair FGF5 function. Similarly  the models predicted a loss-of-function for the shorter  truncated protein produced from the c.245G > A allele and which lacked all ß-strands (Figure ).  Alignment of the FGF5 amino-acid sequence predicted from the equine wild type allele (Wt-FGF5  [Ensembl:ENSECAT00000016512]) and the c.433_434delAT mutant Poitou allele (Po-FGF5). The signal peptide is indicated in bold characters. The secondary structure predicted by the Phyre program is represented by the arrows below the Wt-FGF5 sequence. Arrows with numbers represent the 12 ß-strands. The predicted N-ter a-helix is indicated. The frameshift produced by the c.433_434delAT deletion is framed. A star indicates the location of the stop codon produced by the c.245G > A nonsense mutation.  3D models built using the Phyre server represent the horse wild type Wt-FGF5 (left) and the donkey c.433_434delAT Poitou Po-FGF5 (right) proteins; the a-helix is highlighted in blue and the ß strands are depicted by arrows. To conclude  we propose that the prevalent c.433_434delAT deletion identified in all Poitou donkeys constitutes the recessive long-hair  Poitou allele and that the c.245G > A nonsense mutation  which is rarely identified in the Poitou and other breeds  constitutes a long-hair  donkey allele. Although the long-hair phenotype is a distinctive characteristic of the Poitou donkey breed  the molecular mechanisms responsible for this trait have not yet been reported. Since the mapping tools that have been developed for horses are poorly efficient in donkeys []  we opted for a candidate gene approach that targeted the  gene for which loss-of-function mutations have been shown to produce a conserved long-hair phenotype in mammals (). Due to the high conservation between donkey sequences and the horse reference genome  we successfully amplified the complete  coding sequence in donkeys using intron primers that were designed from the horse sequence []. Among the polymorphisms identified  the Poitou-specific c.433_434delAT deletion was postulated to be a deleterious mutation  since the resulting allele produces a truncated protein that lacks seven of the 12 ß-strands involved in FGF5 function. Indeed  if this allele is present in two copies  it is associated with the long-hair phenotype in ~90% (31/35) of the Poitou donkeys from our cohort. The remaining 10% of long-haired Poitou donkeys from the cohort could be explained by the combined inheritance of this c.433_434delAT deletion with another recessive c.245G > A mutation. Interestingly  the latter mutation was also detected as a single copy in individuals from four other short-hair donkey breeds. We observed high levels of similarities between the donkey FGF5 protein sequence and several mammalian orthologs  which emphasizes that the wild type FGF5 protein may also be functional in donkeys. FGF ligands carry out their diverse functions by binding and activating FGF receptors (FGFR)  which belong to the family of tyrosine kinase receptors  in a heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan (HSGAG)-dependent manner [] [] []. Thus  binding of the FGF ligand to HSGAG and FGFR promotes dimerization and stabilization of the FGF-HSGAG-FGFR complex  which induces the activation of tyrosine kinase and the downstream intracellular signaling processes []. While the HSGAG binding site of FGF is composed of the ß1-ß2 loop and parts of the region spanning ß10 and ß12 []  residues involved in the FGFR interaction are located in several regions including ß1  ß2  ß9 and ß12 strands  ß1-ß2 and ß8-ß9 turns  ß3-ß4 loop for the FGF - D2 region of FGFR and in regions including ß1 and ß4 to ß8 sheets and ß4-ß5  ß7-ß8 and ß8-ß9 loops for the FGF - D3 region of FGFR []. It should be noted that the 12 ß-strands and critical residues involved in the binding of FGF5 with HSGAG and FGFR interactions are conserved in horses and donkeys (Figure  and [])  which suggests that the wild type FGF5 protein is functional in both species. In silico  the c.245G > A and the c.433_434delAT mutant alleles yield truncated FGF5 proteins that lack all or the last seven ß-strands  respectively (Figure ). If correctly addressed within the cell and secreted  the encoded truncated proteins are thus unlikely to mediate the FGF5 signaling process  which strongly suggests that  and  are two loss-of-function donkey alleles of . This is in agreement with long-haired phenotypes previously observed in FGF5-deficient mice  humans  dogs and cats [] []-[]. To the best of our knowledge  long-haired horses have never been reported. In contrast  four long-haired donkey breeds have been described  including the Poitou breed. For this breed  we provide strong evidence that all individuals are deficient in FGF5 signaling  either because they carry two copies of the most prevalent loss-of-function  allele  or because they are compound heterozygotes carrying the two loss-of-function  and  alleles. Interestingly  these two alleles were also detected at low frequency in heterozygous individuals from short-haired French breeds. The probability that the two  and  alleles could have independently arisen in several breeds as a consequence of distinct mutation events is very low. It is more likely that they result from founder mutations that were disseminated because of outcrossing. Altough the genealogy of the donkeys included in this study is not known  the hypothesis of common ancestors is supported by the history of French breeds. Indeed  the studbooks of Berry Black  Normand and Bourbonnais breeds are very recent  i.e. they were created in 1994  1997 and 2002  respectively. In 2011  34 Berry Black and 66 Normand donkeys were registered in France  and in 2012  10 Bourbonnais donkeys were registered (). Previous registrations were accepted based on aesthetic criteria  which has certainly favored individuals with genomic admixture of other breeds. Other long-haired donkeys belong to the American miniature donkey breed that displays the so-called ¿woolly phenotype¿  and to the two endangered  related Spanish Zamorano-Leonés and Portuguese Burro de Miranda breeds. In the 1990s¿  Zamorano jennies were imported to the French Poitou region during a preservation program  and  in the last decades  many Spanish donkeys were imported to France. Thus  it can be hypothesized that the  allele was introgressed from the Spanish breeding stock  which is supported by genealogical analyses that revealed that the four Poitou compound heterozygotes of our cohort were descendants of Zamorano jennies. Moreover  it is highly problable that the most prevalent  allele was fixed by Poitou breeders during the 19 century  which corresponded to the golden period of this breed. Haplotype analyses on a larger cohort of donkeys  including Miranda and Zamorano individuals  would help confirm these hypotheses. Currently  the small number of registered donkeys in each breed prevents more in-depth analyses. Our results highlight the allelic heterogeneity of the long-hair phenotype in donkeys and enlarge the panel of recessive  loss-of-function alleles described in mammals. Identification of mutations that underlie the long-hair phenotype in donkeys will help breeders to detect heterozygous carriers in short-haired French breeds and thus prevent matings at risk to produce non-eligible long-haired foals. Finally  it would be interesting to test for the  and  alleles the American miniature donkeys that have been reported to be woolly-haired and that were produced in the USA. The DNA test developed from this study is available to the community and will help breeders to identify carriers in their breeding stocks. MA designed the study and collected samples.

Genomic prediction is currently used in many breeding schemes around the world. Initial challenges for genomic prediction were to overcome the so-called  < <  problem  because the number of SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) effects () that needs to be estimated in the model is typically much larger than the number of individuals with records in the training dataset (). Much research in the past few years has been conducted to develop and test different genomic prediction models []. With the costs of genotyping dropping continuously  and with the expected use of whole-genome sequence data in practical applications in the short term []  the dimensions of datasets are growing rapidly. This also means that processing time and computer memory requirements of many genomic prediction models will rapidly increase. Genomic prediction models can be roughly divided into two sets of models i.e. one that estimates the explained variance specific to each SNP or group of SNPs in the model  comprising most Bayesian genomic prediction models [] [] []  and one that completely relies on prior assumptions to define the explained variance that may be common for all SNPs  such as the RR-BLUP (referring to Random Regression Best Linear Unbiased Prediction [] or Ridge Regression BLUP []) and the GBLUP (genomic-BLUP []) models. Several studies have shown that using SNP-specific variances to give more weight to SNPs with large effects  may improve the accuracy of genomic prediction [] [] []  although other studies  in particular those based on real data  have reported no differences in accuracies []. However  in traditional pedigree-based breeding value estimation models used in routine evaluations  variance components and breeding values are rarely estimated simultaneously  because this is computationally not feasible when using very large datasets []. Instead  variance components are usually estimated for a subset of the data  for which more stringent editing criteria are applied compared to data used for breeding value estimation. Because variance components are expected to be relatively consistent over time  they are re-estimated less frequently using REML or Bayesian models [] []. However  for some species  breeding values are estimated much more frequently i.e. for dairy cattle [] twice or four times per year for national genetic evaluations according to the ICAR guidelines [] and for pig and poultry on a weekly or even daily basis. Compared to the models applied to estimate variance components  those applied to predict breeding values use different algorithms  for example preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) []. To reduce computational burden in genomic prediction models  while still being able to use SNP-specific variances  a similar strategy that estimates separately variance components at low frequency and breeding values at much higher frequency appears to be an interesting option. The objectives of this study were: (1) to describe genomic prediction models that involve separate steps to estimate SNP variances and to estimate GEBV (genome-enhanced breeding values) using BLUP  (2) to compare the performance of this two-step procedure with the equivalent Bayesian model that estimates SNP variances and breeding values simultaneously  and (3) to investigate the impact on the reliability of GEBV obtained using BLUP with SNP variances estimated on random or non-random subsets of the data. These objectives were investigated using dairy cattle data. Two Bayesian models were used to estimate SNP effects and SNP specific variances i.e. Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) [] [] and BayesC []. The general model was: where  is a vector of phenotypic records   is the overall mean   is a vector of 1s   is an incidence matrix that links records to individuals   is a vector of the random polygenic effects of all individuals   is a matrix that contains the scaled and centered genotypes (such that they have a distribution (0 1) for each locus) of all individuals   is a vector of the (random) allele substitution effects for all loci  and  a vector of the random residuals. The difference between BSSVS and BayesC lies in the distributions from which the allele substitution effects are drawn. In both models  for each iteration of the implemented Gibbs sampler  a QTL (quantitative trait locus)-indicator  is sampled for each locus  In both models  the effect is sampled from a distribution with large effects if  = 1. When  = 0  the effect is either sampled from a distribution with small effects (BSSVS) or is set to 0 (BayesC). For BSSVS  the estimate of  is drawn from: where  is the sum of the products of the genotypes at locus  and <U+03BB> is equal to   and  For BayesC  the estimate of  is drawn from:  if  = 1  0 if   = 0 where  For both models   has a prior distribution of: where  is the degrees of freedom  set to 4.2 following []  and the scale parameter  is calculated as   where  is the prior value of  and is computed as  for BSSVS  where  is the total genetic variance and  is the number of loci  and as  for BayesC []. The posterior value of  is drawn from the following inverse- distribution for BSSVS: where  is the total number of SNP loci in the data   is a vector with squares of the current estimates of the allele substitution effects of all loci  which is weighted by vector  that contains values of 1 or 100 for each locus. The posterior value of  is drawn from the following inverse- distribution for BayesC: For both models  the posterior distribution of the QTL-indicator for locus  () was (following the notation in []): where   with  containing the conditional phenotypes and (| = d)  with d being equal to either 0 or 1 and proportional to . For BSSVS  . For BayesC   and . Finally  the conditional posterior density of  is an inverse- distribution: where  is the number of animals with records  and  is a vector of the current residuals. More details on the BSSVS model are in Calus et al. []  Calus [] and Verbyla et al. []  and more details on the BayesC model are in Habier et al. []. Both BSSVS and BayesC were run using Gibbs sampling. For each BSSVS and BayesC analysis  two replicates that each consisted of a Gibbs chain of 60 000 iterations were run  discarding 10 000 iterations for burn-in. For BSSVS  parameter  was set to 0.999  based on our experience with this model. For BayesC  parameter  was set to 0.9 for BayesC  in line with estimates for this parameter in the literature []. In addition to the two Bayesian models  three BLUP models were used to predict GEBV of validation animals. The parameterization of all three BLUP models was similar to that of the Bayesian models  except that the BLUP models did not estimate SNP (specific) variances and they were solved using Gauss-Seidel instead of Gibbs sampling. Convergence criteria were computed across the mean  polygenic breeding values and SNP effects as the sum of squared differences between current and previous solutions  divided by the sum of squared current solutions []. The threshold used for convergence was 10[]. To evaluate the impact of using a more relaxed convergence criterion on the reliability and the number of iterations required  a convergence criterion of 10 was also tested. The first BLUP model  RR-BLUP  defined the SNP variance as the total genetic variance divided by the total number of SNP loci. The second BLUP model used SNP-specific variances that were computed using BSSVS. This model will hereafter be referred to as BLUP-SSVS. The third BLUP model used SNP-specific variances that were computed using BayesC. This model will hereafter be referred to as BLUP-C. Genetic variances were required to compute prior SNP-variances for BSSVS and BayesC  and to compute SNP-variances used in RR-BLUP. For RR-BLUP  the SNP-specific variance was set equal to 95% of the genetic variance divided by the number of SNPs. Note that it was divided by the number of SNPs because  after scaling and centering  all genotypes had a variance of 1. The variance of the polygenic effects was set as 5% of the genetic variance. Likewise  residual variances were required for the RR-BLUP model. The genetic and residual variances were estimated from the data with a pedigree-based model. For both BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C  the variance of the polygenic effect and the residual variance were directly obtained from the corresponding Bayesian models. The estimated SNP variances of the BSSVS model  to be used in the BLUP-SSVS model  were computed as: where  is the posterior probability of locus   that is computed as the average of the QTL indicator  across all iterations after the burn-in  and  is the posterior mean of the SNP variance component. Likewise  the estimated SNP variances of the BayesC model  to be used in the BLUP-C model  were computed as: As mentioned before  the BLUP models were implemented using Gauss-Seidel  while the Bayesian models were implemented using Gibbs sampling. The treatment of the SNP variances differed between models  in the sense that they were estimated in the Bayesian models and assumed known in the BLUP models. To compute the conditional values of the allele substitution effects within iterations  in both the BLUP and Bayesian models  the right-hand-side updating algorithm was used []. This algorithm is an extension of residual updating that uses the feature that each locus has only three genotypes  which drastically reduces the required number of computations. To avoid rounding errors due to residual updating  the residuals were recomputed every 100th iteration []. The order of the SNPs in which they were handled  was permuted every 10th iteration to speed up convergence in the BLUP models and to improve mixing in the Bayesian models solved with Gibbs sampling. This implies that the BLUP models also used a random seed  except that this was only used to permute the order in which the SNPs were evaluated. For each analysis of the BLUP and the Bayesian models  two replicates were performed using different seeds. Final estimates for each scenario were obtained as the average of the two replicates. The data comprised 5000 Holstein Friesian dairy bulls with genotypes and de-regressed estimated breeding values (EBV) obtained from the Dutch national evaluations for the six following traits: protein yield  udder depth (UD)  somatic cell score (SCS)  interval from first to last insemination (IFL)  direct longevity (DLO)  and longevity including information from the predictor traits UD  SCS and locomotion (LON). Reliabilities of the EBV were used to compute effective daughter contributions (EDC) []  which were used as weights in the analyses  by dividing the residual variance for each bull by its EDC. The genotypes were edited as part of a larger dataset. SNPs with a minor allele frequency below 0.025  a difference between observed and expected fraction of heterozygotes (based on Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium) larger than 0.15  or a call rate higher than 90% were removed. Any missing individual genotype was imputed using DAGPHASE [] and Beagle []  to avoid missing genotypes in the final data. The training data consisted of 4245 to 4271 animals across the six traits. The validation population comprised all bulls with phenotypic information in the data born since January 1 2004 onwards  with a total number of 729. In terms of animals used in the Bayesian models versus the BLUP models  four different scenarios were considered  as summarized in Table . In the first scenario  all animals in the training dataset were used in the Bayesian models and RR-BLUP. This scenario is termed `FULL¿ hereafter. In the second scenario  a random selection of 50% of the animals from the training dataset was used in the Bayesian models and RR-BLUP  and the BLUP-C and BLUP-SSVS used the SNP-wise variances from BayesC and BSSVS  with the corresponding reduced data. This scenario is termed `RAN50¿ hereafter. It reflects a situation for which SNP-variances are estimated on a reduced random subset of the data. In the third scenario  the 50% of the animals in the training dataset with the highest de-regressed EBV were used in the Bayesian models. This scenario is termed `TOP50¿ hereafter. It reflects a situation in which SNP-variances are estimated on a reduced non-random subset of the data. The fourth scenario is similar to the third  but uses the 50% animals with the lowest de-regressed EBV. This scenario is termed `BOT50¿ hereafter. It should be noted that both the TOP50 and BOT50 scenarios were defined for each trait separately and thus contained different animals for different traits. In all four scenarios  all training animals were used with the BLUP models BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C. Reliability of GEBV was calculated as the squared correlation between de-regressed EBV and GEBV  divided by the average reliability of the initial EBV that were de-regressed (ranging from 0.82 to 0.96 across traits). It should be noted that the GEBV consisted of the sum of the SNP effects and the polygenic effect. Standard errors of the reliabilities were computed for both BLUP and Bayesian models using bootstrapping through the R-package ¿boot¿ []. The bootstrapping procedure involved computing reliabilities for 10 000 bootstrapping samples of the 729 validation animals. Standard errors were computed as the standard deviation of those 10 000 reliability estimates. For each scenario  this standard error was computed for each replicate and then averaged across the two replicates. Bias of the GEBV was assessed by comparing mean de-regressed EBV and mean GEBV across all validation animals  and by evaluating coefficients of the regression of de-regressed EBV on GEBV. For the BLUP models  the number of iterations to reach convergence is reported as a measure of efficiency. For BSSVS and BayesC  the estimated value of the SNP variance component was plotted for each iteration in the Gibbs chain  for visual inspection of its convergence. In order to assess whether the length of the Gibbs chain was sufficient  the effective chain length of the 50 000 samples after burn-in was computed using the R package Coda []. Estimated reliabilities of GEBV across traits  scenarios  and models are in Table . Results indicate that within scenarios  the BSSVS and BayesC models had very similar reliabilities  while the RR-BLUP model generally had slightly lower reliabilities than BSSVS and BayesC  although the difference was only significantly different from 0 ( < 0.05) for the trait DLO. Although not significant at  < 0.05  the -value of the difference between the reliability using RR-BLUP and the reliability using the Bayesian models was less than 0.10 for protein and LON (results not shown). The models BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C always used all training animals  but used SNP variances that were estimated with BSSVS and BayesC using different training datasets in the different scenarios. Reliabilities obtained with BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C were always very similar to the reliabilities obtained with BSSVS and BayesC in the FULL scenario. Comparing the reliabilities of BSSVS and BayesC across different scenarios indicates that selecting the best animals (TOP50) as training animals yielded a slightly higher reliability for four out of six traits than selecting training animals at random  while selecting the worst animals (BOT50) yielded very low reliabilities for five out of six traits. In summary  these results indicate that using random (RAN50) or non-random subsets (TOP50 and BOT50) to estimate SNP variances does not affect the GEBV  as long as the training data used to predict the GEBV includes all animals. The equivalence of the GEBV obtained in the FULL scenario  is illustrated by the correlation between GEBV obtained with those different models (Table ). These correlations clearly indicate that BSSVS  BayesC  BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C gave very similar GEBV (correlations > 0.99) for all traits and scenarios. The GEBV obtained with RR-BLUP that assumes that each SNP explains the same amount of variance  tended to be slightly different from the GEBV obtained with the other models  with correlations ranging from 0.94 to 0.99. For all scenarios  models and traits  de-regressed EBV were compared to the GEBV  to investigate potential bias in the GEBV. The difference between mean of the de-regressed EBV and mean of the GEBV gives an indication of the bias in the level of the GEBV. Those differences show that within scenarios  biases of the Bayesian models and RR-BLUP were very similar (Table ). Compared to the FULL scenario  for BSSVS  BayesC and RR-BLUP  the bias with the RAN50 scenario was somewhat higher for all traits except DLO and LON  and even more so for the TOP50 and BOT50 scenarios. In all scenarios  the bias in the level of predictions with models BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C was similar to the bias observed with the Bayesian models and RR-BLUP in the FULL scenario. Slopes of the regression of de-regressed EBV on the GEBV indicate bias in the scale of the GEBV  i.e. values greater (lower) than 1.0 indicate underestimation (overestimation) of the variance of the GEBV. For the FULL scenario  regression coefficients deviated most from 1.0 for RR-BLUP and were substantially lower than 1.0 for all traits (Table ). The other models yielded regression coefficients closer to 1.0  but also had values substantially lower than 1.0 for the traits IFL  DLO and LON. Compared to the FULL scenario  the GEBV obtained with BSSVS and BayesC always showed a greater bias for the BOT50 scenario except for protein  and for some traits also for the RAN50 scenario. However the TOP50 scenario tended to yield the least biased GEBV  even compared to the FULL scenario  except for SCS and UD. Distributions of estimated SNP-specific variances of the Bayesian models were studied since the most important difference between the Bayesian models and the RR-BLUP model lies in the SNP variance used to estimate the SNP effects. The distributions of the two independent replicates were very similar  and therefore only the distribution for the first replicates is shown in Figure . These results show that the maximum SNP variances were substantially larger for the BSSVS model compared to the BayesC model.  Estimates were obtained for all six traits in the FULL scenario  for the first replicate. The largest SNP variances across traits were equal to 0.52  0.0165  0.0270  0.0086  76.95 and 76.15 for BSSVS and 0.059  0.0041  0.0033  0.0020  8.09  and 7.90 for BayesC. The pattern of the SNP variance component across iterations  appeared to be quite stable after the 10 000 iterations of burn-in  both for BSSVS and BayesC  as illustrated in Figure  for the first replicate of each trait in the FULL scenario. In fact  the patterns suggest that using 5000 iterations for burn-in would be sufficient for all traits and both models  while for some traits as little as 2000 iterations appears to be sufficient for burn-in.  Estimates were obtained for all six traits in the FULL scenario; values are shown only for the first replicate. The effective chain length of the last 50 000 samples is given for each figure. Effective chain lengths ranged from 57.9 to 211.4 for BSSVS and from 179.6 to 522.2 for BayesC (Figure ). In nearly all cases  the effective chain length was roughly twice as large for BayesC compared to BSSVS  suggesting that the SNP variance component reaches convergence faster in BayesC than in BSSVS. Considering that the effective chain length should be at least 50  this suggests that across traits and models  anywhere between ~5000 and 50 000 iterations are required after burn-in. The number of iterations required for the different BLUP models until convergence  averaged across both replicates  is in Table . In general  the required number of iterations was rather similar for RR-BLUP  BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C. The only clear difference was observed between RR-BLUP on the one hand  and BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C on the other hand for the traits UD and SCS in the TOP50 scenario and for IFL in the BOT 50 scenario. In those cases  RR-BLUP required 4000 to 5000 iterations compared to 13 000 to 16 000 for BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C. When using a convergence criteria of 10 instead of 10 for the FULL scenario  GEBV had very similar reliabilities (Table )  and were indeed virtually the same  i.e. they had a correlation higher than 0.999 (results not shown). The required number of iterations  however  was only 1832 to 4928 (Table )  and thereby decreased by 71 to 90% compared to the more stringent convergence criterion of 10. The objectives of this study were to develop and describe genomic prediction models with a separate step to estimate SNP specific variances with a Bayesian model and a subsequent step to predict GEBV using a BLUP model. Such a system has the advantage that SNP variances can be estimated less frequently  while genomic evaluations can be performed at higher frequency with a BLUP model. BLUP models have the advantage that monitoring of convergence is straightforward and convergence is obtained within a limited number of iterations  as our results confirmed  while it was expected that the results of the BLUP models were similar to those of the Bayesian models. Our results confirmed that the BLUP models  using SNP-specific variances  yielded GEBV that were very similar to those with the Bayesian models  even if the SNP-specific variances were estimated from a non-random subset of the data. Other studies have drawn similar conclusions when SNP variances were estimated with Lasso [] or BayesB [] and later used in a GBLUP type of model  or when a non-linear weighting was directly incorporated in the GBLUP model []  although those studies did not investigate the sensitivity of the models to estimating SNP variances from non-random subsets of the data. Another advantage of using pre-computed SNP variances from the data rather than using variances that are  distributed across the SNPs  is that the SNP variances used are not very dependent on assumptions that need to be made in RR-BLUP  where the variance for all SNPs is assumed equal and simply computed as the total genetic variance divided by the number of SNPs. Using estimated SNP variances instead  allows the variances to differ between SNPs  and even to adapt  for instance  to linkage disequilibrium between SNPs  which may affect the variance associated to them. Our results suggest that the assumptions of  e.g.  RR-BLUP may result in less accurate and more biased predictions. The GEBV obtained using BSSVS and BayesC were very similar  despite the observation that the distributions of SNP effects differed considerably between the two models (Figure ). It should be noted that the differences in SNP-specific variances between the two Bayesian models were mainly due to differences in priors. Initially  p was set equal to 0.999 and 0.99 for BSSVS and BayesC  respectively. The value of 0.99 for BayesC was chosen to obtain the same prior SNP variance component  for both models. However  the reliabilities obtained for BayesC with this initial value for p were substantially lower than those for BSSVS (results now shown). Therefore  we decided to use a p value of 0.90 for BayesC  which is closer to empirical estimates for BayesC reported in the literature []. With this value of p for BayesC  results of BSSVS and BayesC were very similar. Although BSSVS and BayesC consistently outperformed RR-BLUP  the difference in observed reliabilities was not significantly different from 0 for nearly all cases  despite the relatively large number of validation animals used  i.e. 724. Also  the scale of the GEBV obtained with BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C was consistently less biased than the scale of the GEBV obtained with RR-BLUP. In fact  when SNP variances were estimated with a subset of the data (RAN50  TOP50 and BOT50)  both BLUP-SSVS and BLUP-C  which used all training data  were in most cases able to reduce the bias observed in the level of the GEBV (Table ) and overcome the bias observed in the scale of the GEBV with the Bayesian models (Table ). These results are in line with those of other studies that suggest that bias in GEBV due to genomic pre-selection can be overcome by including all information of selected and unselected animals when estimating GEBV [] []. However  based on our results using all information does not seem necessary when estimating the SNP variances. Thus  it is concluded that genomic prediction models that use pre-computed SNP variances are efficient and can generate GEBV with improved properties  in terms of reliability and bias  compared to the commonly used RR-BLUP model. One clear trend in the results was that GEBV predicted using the 50% of the animals in the training data with the highest de-regressed EBV (TOP50) resulted for most traits (Protein  SCS  DLO  and LON) in a higher reliability than using a random 50% of the animals as training data (RAN50). For all traits except IFL  selecting the 50% animals with the lowest de-regressed EBV resulted in a very low reliability. The explanation for these results is that the validation animals in our study are not just a random subset of animals  but selection candidates  i.e. their sires most likely have an above average breeding value and are therefore likely to be included in the training data in the TOP50 scenario. This explanation can be investigated by simply counting per scenario the number of selection candidates that have sires  paternal or maternal grandsires with de-regressed EBV in the training data. The results are in Table  and show that the number of male ancestors in the reference population were substantially larger for the TOP50 animals than for the RAN50 animals for all traits  except for IFL  in agreement with the observation that IFL had a substantially lower reliability with the TOP50 scenario compared to the RAN50 scenario. Thus  using only the TOP50 training animals results in a set of training data that are highly related to the selection candidates for most traits  which is known to result in higher reliabilities [] [] []. In fact  our results suggest that when resources are limited to compose a training dataset  the best approach may be to genotype only the animals with high EBV. Some simulation studies show that selecting only the top animals may lead to substantially biased [] and inaccurate predictions []. In our study  reliabilities for four out of six traits were higher for the TOP50 scenario than for the RAN50 scenario. Only for IFL  was the reliability considerably lower for TOP50 than for BOT50  simply because the number of male ancestors for the validation animals was much greater for BOT50 than TOP50. At the same time  for four out of six traits  the bias was smaller for the TOP50 scenario than for the RAN50 scenario. Thus  in general  our results were better for TOP50 than for RAN50. The most likely reason for the discrepancy between our results and those in the aforementioned simulation studies [] []  is that the predicted animals were selection candidates in our study  and thereby more likely to be offspring of the top animals  while the predicted animals were generated through random mating in the studies of Jiménez-Montero et al. [] and Bolignon et al. []. In our study  the effective chain length of the SNP variance component was evaluated as a measure of convergence of the Bayesian models. This clearly showed that the effective chain length increased almost continuously with the number of iterations [see Additional file : Figure S1]. However  it is unclear whether effective chain length is indeed an indicator of convergence  for instance at the level of estimated SNP-specific variances. One way to assess convergence of SNP-specific variances  is to evaluate the correlation between posterior means of variance estimates from two independent replicates  where a correlation close to 1 indicates that both independent chains have converged to very similar SNP-specific variances. We computed this correlation every 1000th iteration and compared it to the effective chain length of the SNP variance component achieved at that iteration after burn-in [see Additional file : Figure S2]. This shows  that with the BSSVS model  an effective chain length of 50 was sufficient to obtain similar SNP-specific variances between replicates for LON  DLO  and SCS (correlations ranged from 0.87 to 0.92). However for the traits Protein  UD and IFL  correlations between SNP variances ranged only from 0.47 to 0.54 when an effective chain length of ~50 was obtained. With BayesC  for all traits  the SNP-specific variances were very similar (correlations above 0.91) after an effective chain length of ~200  which was achieved for all traits within the 50 000 iterations performed after the burn-in [see Additional file : Figure S1]). This shows that the SNP-specific variances estimated with BayesC converged in considerably fewer iterations compared to BSSVS  as indicated by the observation that for a given number of iterations the effective chain length of the SNP variance component was roughly twice as large for BayesC than for BSSVS. With both BLUP and Bayesian models  the order of the SNPs was permuted every 10th iteration. This strategy was initially implemented to improve mixing in the Gibbs chain for the Bayesian models. This strategy also helped to speed up convergence in the BLUP models (results not shown). Other reported strategies that speed up convergence are to order the SNPs based on decreasing minor allele frequency []. Our implementation of the BLUP models used Gauss Seidel. Legarra and Misztal [] showed that Gauss Seidel was 4.6 times slower than PCG. Their comparison showed that PCG was more efficient because it required ~8 times fewer iterations  while one iteration took twice as long for PCG than one iteration of Gauss Seidel. It should be noted that we used right-hand-side updating [] in the Gauss Seidel implementation  which is shown to be ~5 times faster than the residual updating algorithm used by Legarra and Misztal [] when the training data contains ~5000 animals []. However  right-hand-side updating cannot be applied to the PCG algorithm. The number of iterations required for RR-BLUP to reach convergence ranged from 4017 to 19 980 (Table ). These numbers are much larger than for instance the 164 required iterations reported by Legarra and Misztal []. We expected that this difference may be due to the fact that our models included a polygenic effect that is at least partly confounded with the SNP effects. In such situations  the Gauss-Seidel algorithm may be inefficient. Since convergence was monitored at the level of the estimated SNP effects and polygenic breeding values  the GEBV may in fact have converged much faster. To investigate this  one additional replicate was run for all BLUP models for all traits and the FULL scenario  for 200 000 iterations. GEBV were stored every 1000 iterations  and their correlation with the final estimates after 200 000 iterations were computed  following a similar approach as []. These results showed that correlations with final estimates greater than 0.9999 and 0.999 were obtained within the first 1000 iterations for all traits with RRBLUP and BLUP-C  respectively. For BLUP-SSVS  correlations greater than 0.999 were obtained within 1000 iterations for four out of six traits. For UD and IFL  4000 and 7000 iterations were required to obtain correlations above 0.99. This suggests that for most applications of the BLUP models included in our study  convergence at the level of the GEBV is expected to be reached within the first 1000 iterations. Thus  monitoring convergence at the level of the estimated SNP and polygenic effects may unnecessarily increase the total number of iterations. Whether this holds for a particular application can be investigated by computing correlations between GEBV after different numbers of iterations with ¿final¿ estimates  as outlined above. To further test the hypothesis that the confounding between SNP and polygenic effects leads to poor convergence at the level of the estimated SNP and polygenic effects  the analyses with RR-BLUP in the FULL scenario were repeated without a polygenic effect in the model for all six traits  using a convergence criterion of 10. The results (Table ) show that in this case  only 29 to 131 iterations were required  i.e. less than 1% of the iterations required for the RR-BLUP model that did include a polygenic effect. At the same time  however  the obtained reliabilities were 0.015 to 0.031 lower than those obtained with the RR-BLUP model that did include a polygenic effect (Table ). This stresses that polygenic effects capture some additional variance in genomic prediction models []  which results in slightly higher accuracy of GEBV  as also demonstrated in other studies [] []  although this may require much more iterations to reach convergence of the BLUP models  as shown in our study. Within the proposed framework  an important question is how often the SNP variances should be estimated. Or in other words: how fast are estimated SNP effects expected to change in time? So far  there are no published reports based on real data that have investigated this issue. The answer probably depends on several factors  including selection intensity  effective size of the population  density of the SNP chip used  initial size of the training data  and whether or not the size and composition of the training data change over time. For instance  it has been shown that a strong increase in the size of the training dataset leads to a much wider range of estimated SNP effects  even in a model for which the variance allocated to each SNP was the same []. This indicates that increasing the size of the training dataset  will also change SNP variances because power to estimate these variances increases. Similarly  an important question for traditional pedigree-based genetic evaluation models is how often variance components should be re-estimated. For traditional genetic evaluation models applied in dairy cattle  the Interbull recommendation is to estimate variance components as often as possible and definitely  at least  once per generation []. Since the additive genetic variance estimated with an animal model is expected to be the same as the sum of all SNP variances  SNP variances are expected to change more than variance components used in conventional pedigree-based animal models. This suggests that SNP variances should be estimated more frequently than overall variance components. Moreover  our results indicate that the results of the BLUP models are very robust against using non-random subsets of the data to estimate SNP variances. This suggests that re-estimating SNP variances once a year is expected to be more than sufficient. Our results show that BLUP genomic prediction models can adopt the same characteristics and yield the same results as variable selection models  provided that they use SNP-specific variances that are estimated with the variable selection models. This permits a flexible genomic evaluation system  for which SNP variances are perhaps re-estimated once per year using a Bayesian model  while efficient BLUP models that permit easy evaluation of convergence during the analysis  can be applied to estimate GEBV at a much higher frequency. To monitor convergence in the Bayesian models  computing the effective chain length of the SNP variance component appears to be a useful measure. For the two Bayesian models used here  the estimated SNP-specific variances converged in considerably fewer iterations with BayesC than with BSSVS. Our results confirmed that in order to get unbiased GEBV  it is important that the training dataset covers the entire population and that it is not composed of a pre-selected group of animals. However  using a pre-selected group of animals to estimate the SNP-specific variances did not affect the resulting GEBV  provided that the training data used in the BLUP step covered the entire population. Genomic prediction models that use pre-computed SNP variances proved to be able to generate GEBV with better properties  in terms of reliability and bias  than the commonly used RR-BLUP model. Including a separate polygenic effect systematically improved the reliabilities of the GEBV but also substantially increased the number of iterations needed to reach convergence for the RR-BLUP model. de los Campos G  Hickey JM  Pong-Wong R  Daetwyler HD  Calus MPL: Whole-genome regression and prediction methods applied to plant and animal breeding.

Furthermore  it has the advantage that matrix inversion is not required. We have investigated parallel computing to speedup SSBR analyses so they can be used for routine applications. Due to advances in molecular biology  high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data are now being incorporated with phenotypic data into genetic evaluation [–] in what has been called genomic prediction or genomic selection []. Typically  genotypes are initially available only on a few thousand individuals at many thousands to several hundred thousand SNPs. Phenotypic values or deregressed estimated breeding values (EBV) on these genotyped individuals are used to estimate the effects of the SNPs using Bayesian multiple-regression models in which the marker effects are treated as random []. We refer to such models as marker effect models (MEM). The estimated marker effects are then used to predict the breeding values (BV) of animals that may not yet have phenotypes but have been genotyped. Nejati-Javaremi [] proposed an alternative approach to incorporate genotype information into genetic evaluation  where the BV of the animals are fitted  as in a pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) analysis  but with a genomic relationship matrix  computed from available genotypes  that replaces the pedigree-based additive relationship matrix. We refer to these models as breeding value models (BVM). Fernando [] showed that the MEM and BVM provide equivalent predictions of BV and that predictions could be more easily obtained from MEM than from BVM because at the time of their study the number of markers was much smaller than the number of genotyped animals. This situation changed when high-density SNP data became available and the BVM was rediscovered for genomic selection [  ]. In this context  BLUP using the BVM is often referred to as G-BLUP. When MEM are used and not all animals are genotyped  marker-based EBV are typically combined with pedigree-based BLUP EBV from the entire breeding population to improve accuracy  using various selection-index approximations [  ]. Legarra et al. [–] proposed an alternative to this approximate approach to combine information from genotyped and non-genotyped animals  where in a single step  they obtain BLUP EBV combining phenotypic  pedigree and SNP data using Henderson’s mixed model equations (MME) for a BVM with a modified version of the additive relationship matrix  that reflects the additional information from the SNP genotypes. Thus  their method is called single-step BLUP (SS-BLUP)  and is expected to yield unbiased predictions under multivariate normality  even in populations that are undergoing selection and non-random mating. This is important  because genotypes are usually collected only on superior animals and this can lead to biased evaluations. A properly calculated BLUP evaluation has been shown to be free of this selection bias [–]. Because their BLUP analysis is based on a BVM  we will refer to their SS-BLUP as SSBV-BLUP. In SSBV-BLUP  the SNP data are used to construct the matrix  of genomic relationships for the genotyped individuals [    ]. Conceptually  the remaining relationship coefficients constructed from pedigree are modified to provide consistency with []. Provided that  and the inverse  of the corresponding additive relationship matrix are available  an efficient algorithm has been developed to construct []. However  computing  and  is an inefficient process  because the computing time to obtain these inverses is proportional to   where  is the number of individuals with genotypes. Nevertheless  when  is a few thousands  SSBV-BLUP provides an elegant and convenient method to estimate BV that combines the available phenotype  pedigree and SNP data. Due to wide-spread adoption of genotyping in livestock  however   is becoming too large for SSBV-BLUP to remain computationally feasible much longer [  ]. One strategy to overcome this problem is to approximate  such that the inverse could be computed efficiently []. Another strategy is to obtain solutions to the MME without explicitly inverting []. Because  is very dense and it grows in size as more individuals are genotyped  these strategies are not very promising. As discussed by Stranden and Garrick []  when the number of genotyped individuals exceeds the number of marker covariates  use of MEM  which do not require computing  or its inverse  will lead to more efficient calculations. At present  however  most analyses that use MEM are based on Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques that are computationally demanding. In addition  analyses using MEM have not been able to accommodate animals without genotypes. In this paper  we extend MEM to accommodate animals without genotypes and propose alternative MCMC approaches to address computing requirements. The methodology presented here will extend the attractive features of SSBV-BLUP to Bayesian multiple-regression analyses that draw inferences from posterior distributions using MCMC techniques. Our extended MEM will enable BLUP evaluations without having to compute  or its inverse  while combining information from genotyped and non-genotyped animals. We begin this section with a short introduction to the most widely used MEM and equivalent BVM. Then  we briefly review the theory that underlies SSBV-BLUP and show that the BVM used in SSBV-BLUP is equivalent to an MEM that can be used for single-step Bayesian regression (SSBR). Finally  strategies will be presented to implement a Gibbs sampler for drawing inferences from the posterior distributions of the breeding values. The groundbreaking paper of Meuwissen et al. [] proposed three multiple-regression  MEM for genomic selection. These models can be described by the following general model: where  is the vector of trait phenotypes   is a known incidence matrix that relates the vector of non-genetic  “fixed” effects to   =-()   is a matrix of marker covariates   is the vector of random  partial-regression coefficients of the marker covariates  and  is a vector of residuals. The expected value of the marker covariates can be written as ()=   where the row vector  is the vector of expected values of marker covariates for a random animal in the absence of selection. Meuwissen et al. [] actually used haplotype covariates in their model  but now most analyses are based on SNP marker covariates. Their model assumed that the markers completely capture the first and second moments of the BV. When this is not true  a polygenic residual BV can be added to equation (). Strandén and Christensen showed that different allele coding methods lead to the same inference of marker effects when the general mean is included in the model and all genotypes are observed []. However  centered allele coding  as in matrix   had a numerical advantage when MCMC methods were used []. In the Bayesian implementation of the MEM  the fixed effects are usually given a flat prior. The  are a priori assumed independently distributed as: where  are a priori assumed identically and independently distributed (iid) scaled inverted chi-square variables with scale  and degrees of freedom . The residuals are typically assumed iid normal with null mean and variance   with a scaled inverted chi-square prior for   with scale  and degrees of freedom . In the first model considered by Meuwissen et al. []  the  were iid normal variables with null mean and a common “known” variance  which is equivalent to our general model with =0    and  set to the common known variance. This model was called “BLUP” in their paper []. The second model that they considered (BayesA) is equivalent to our general model with =0  and  and  set to “known” values. Their third model (BayesB) is identical to BayesA  except with =0.95 or some other “known” value. Kizilkaya et al. [  ] modified the “BLUP” model to have a value of >0 and an unknown common variance with a scaled inverted chi-square prior and referred to this model as BayesC. Furthermore  Habier et al. [] extended the BayesC model in which the value of  is unknown with a uniform prior and referred to this as BayesC . In Bayesian Lasso  the marker effects are assigned a double exponential prior. This can be achieved by setting  in equation () to 0 and using an exponential prior distribution for []. Inferences on the breeding values and other unknown parameters in the model are made from their marginal posterior distributions  using MCMC methods [    ]. Let  ' be the row vector of marker covariates for some selection candidate. Then  the conditional mean for its genomic EBV is   where  is the posterior mean of   which can be computed from the MCMC samples. Two mixed linear models are said to be linearly equivalent if the vector  of observations has the same first and second moments in both models []. In that sense  a model that is equivalent to (1) can be written as: where =   and =-() is the matrix of centered marker covariates. One of the advantages of using centered marker covariates is that the vector  of breeding values will have null means even if  does not have null means. The covariance matrix of the breeding values is: Then  in both models (1) and (3)  the mean of  is   and the covariance matrix is: Thus  these two models are linearly equivalent and the parameters of one model can always be written as linear functions of the parameters of the other model. “Consequently  linear and quadratic estimates under one model can be converted by these same linear functions to estimates of an equivalent model” []. When the number of markers is large relative to the size of   BLUP of  can be obtained efficiently [  ] by solving the MME that correspond to model (3). When =0 and  in (1)  the covariance matrix of marker effects is: and the covariance matrix of the genomic BV conditional on  can be written as: Furthermore  under some assumptions  the variance  of marker effects can be related to the variance  of BV as: where  is the frequency of SNP [    ]. Then  equation () can be written as: Suppose genotypes were not available and the analysis is conditional only on pedigree  which we denote as . Then  the conditional mean of  given  is null and the conditional covariance matrix is: where  is the additive relationship matrix  and the variance is computed over the conditional distribution of . Using this variance for  in setting up the MME for equation () results in the usual non-genomic MME for the BVM. Legarra et al. [] proposed an ingenious strategy to combine information from genotyped and non-genotyped animals in a single BLUP analysis based on a BVM  which we refer to as SSBV-BLUP. Suppose  is partitioned as: where  are BV of the animals with missing genotypes  and  are BV of those with observed genotypes . Following Legarra et al. []  the vector  can be written as: where  are partitions of  that correspond to  and . The first term in equation () is the best linear predictor (BLP) of  given   and the second is a residual genetic effect to accommodate deviations between the true breeding value    and its prediction from     which we refer to as   the “imputation residual”. Consider first the conditional distribution of  given . Then  as expected  the variance of  is: where the first term of equation () is the variance of the  (i.e. predicted from its relatives in ) and the second term is the variance of . Similarly  . In this situation  where the covariance structure of  and  is determined entirely by the pedigree  it is easy to see that  in equation () is uncorrelated to   and therefore if  and  are multivariate normal   and  are independent. Multivariate normality of    and consequently of  will be a good approximation if the effective number of loci that contribute to the BV is large. This will be the case even when the individual marker effects do not have a normal distribution  as in BayesA and BayesB. Consider now the conditional distribution of  given . Note that  given the observed genotypes   the distribution of  changes to a multivariate normal with mean  and covariance matrix . Now  to obtain the result in [] for the conditional distribution of  given   we have to assume that the change in the distribution of  occurs entirely as a result of the change in the distribution of . In other words  we only use the information in  that flows to  through  (see Discussion). Then  it can be reasoned that: where now the vector  has covariance matrix given by the first term of equation ()  and because  is independent of   the second term of equation () remains identical to that of equation (). Similarly  the covariance between  and  conditional on  is: Furthermore  assuming equation ()  the above results can be combined to show that conditional on    has a multivariate normal distribution with null mean and covariance matrix: where . An alternative derivation of this matrix was given by Christensen and Lund []. The inverse of this matrix is needed to set up the MME  and can be computed as which is the basis for SSBV-BLUP [    ]. Note that this requires that both  and  are computed beforehand  which is not computationally feasible because these matrices are dense and large when the number  of genotyped animals is large. Furthermore   2' is not full rank when  exceeds the number of markers. Thus to obtain a full rank   ad-hoc adjustments are often made  such as adding small values to the diagonals or regressing  towards   which is justified when the markers do not capture all the genetic variability. However  due to the increased adoption of SNP genotyping in livestock   and  are becoming too large for SSBV-BLUP to remain computationally feasible [  ]. A second problem in SSBV-BLUP is related to the scaling that is done using the SNP frequencies. As mentioned earlier  when all data that were used for selection are available for computing the conditional mean  it can be computed as if selection had not taken place [    ]. If selection has taken place  this requires using SNP frequencies from the founders  because these frequencies are not changed by selection. However  in most situations SNP genotypes are not available in the founders and frequencies observed in the genotyped animals are used  which can lead to biased evaluations  particularly in a multi-breed context. Assuming that BV are captured completely by marker genotypes  the mixed linear model for the phenotypic values can be expressed in terms of a BVM (12) or an MEM (13) as where we have introduced the incidence matrix  to accommodate animals with repeated records or animals without records. As in SSBV-BLUP  suppose  is not observed. Then it is not possible to use equation () as the basis for the MEM. Note that  is equal to . So  using equation () for  and writing =  the model for the phenotypic values becomes: To construct the matrix  of centered marker covariates  we need to know the value of ()=   where the row vector  is the vector of expected values of marker covariates for a random animal in the absence of selection. However  marker covariates are often available only for animals that have been subject to selection. So  we propose to write  as: where = is assigned a flat prior. The reason  can be considered an independent parameter is that  is a vector of unknown parameters. Substituting equation () for = in equation () gives: where       =-    The matrix  of imputed marker covariates can be obtained efficiently  using partitioned inverse results  by solving the easily formed very sparse system [see Additional file ]: where  are partitions of  that correspond to partitioning  into  and . Similarly  the vector  can be obtained efficiently by solving the system: The differences between this MEM (20) and the model that is currently used for Bayesian regression (BR) are: (i) estimation of an extra fixed effect: =  (ii) some of the marker covariates in (20) are imputed  and (iii) a residual term  has been introduced to account for deviations of the imputed marker covariates from their unobserved  actual values. When genotypes are not missing  the vector  is null  and the covariate for  only contains   which is in the column space of  when the model explicitly or implicitly contains the general mean. In this case  it has been shown that inference on differences between breeding values is not affected by the choice of vector  used to center the marker covariates []. This includes using =  which corresponds to not centering  and therefore   does not have to be included in the model. However  when genotypes are missing  may not be in the column space of   and thus  must be included in the model if  is not known and the marker covariates are not centered. A thorough investigation of this approach of including  as a fixed effect in the model in place of centering the marker covariates is beyond the scope of this paper  but a small simulation is included here to compare the accuracy of prediction when marker covariates are centered with those when marker covariates are not centered but  is included in the model. Regardless of the prior used for   the distribution of the vector  of imputation residuals will be approximated by a multivariate normal vector with null mean and covariance matrix  (see equation )  where  is assigned a scaled inverse chi-square distribution with scale parameter  and degrees of freedom . Imputing the marker covariates needs to be done only once  and it can be done efficiently in parallel. Imputation of unobserved marker covariates will not significantly increase the overall computing time  and the storage costs will not be greater than for centered observed genotypes. The MME that correspond to equation () for BayesC with =0 are The submatrix of these MME that correspond to  are identical to those for  from a pedigree-based analysis and are very sparse. Thus  as explained in the next section  conditional on  and    can be sampled efficiently by using either a blocking-Gibbs sampler [  ] or a single-site Gibbs sampler  as used in pedigree-based analyses []. Note that these MME  which do not have  or its inverse  may be used to overcome the computational problems with SSBV-BLUP. The predicted BV can be written as: The MME given by equation () have the advantage that they will not grow in size as more animals are genotyped  in contrast to the MME corresponding to equation () that are given by Aguilar et al. []. Results from solving equation () will not be identical to those from the MME corresponding to equation () because in equation ()   is treated as an unknown  and = is estimated from the genotypic and phenotypic data. However  the MME corresponding to: where   and = will give predictions for breeding values computed as: identical to those from equation (). Consider the pedigree in Table   and assume genotypes are available only on individuals 1  2  and 4. Genotypes  at 10 markers are in Table . Following Legarra et al. []  the relationship matrix is rearranged such that  are relationships among individuals 3  5  and 6  which do not have genotypes  and  are relationships among 1  2  and 4  which have the genotypes in Table . The inverse of the rearranged relationship matrix is given in Table . The imputed genotypes    and the marker covariates    for  of the non-genotyped animals  could be obtained efficiently by solving the sparse systems (21) and (22)  respectively (Table ). To set up the MME  we will assume that     and that   and  are the only fixed effects. Then  the MME (23) and solutions corresponding to the MEM (20) are in Table . For comparison  the MME and solutions for the single-step BV model are given in Table . The solutions for  and  are identical for the two sets of MME. The BLUP of  obtained as equation ()  using the solutions to equation ()  are identical to those obtained from equation ()  and are in Table . Accuracy of prediction was computed for SS-BLUP with and without centering of marker covariates. As demonstrated by the preceding numerical example  the MEM given by (20) or the BVM given by (25) can be used to get identical SS-BLUP predictions. When marker covariates were not centered  accuracy was computed with and without fitting  in the model. The simulated data consisted of 20 paternal halfsib families  each with 20 offspring. Thus  the pedigree consisted of 20 unrelated sires  400 unrelated dams and 400 offspring. Only genotypes from the 400 offspring were used in the analysis. Phenotypes from all 400 offspring and from 210 dams were used. Results are given for four scenarios of the simulation. In all four scenarios  the trait was determined by 50 QTL and had a heritability of 0.5. All QTL effects were sampled from a normal distribution with either mean =0 or mean =0.2. The analysis was based on either 100 or 10 000 marker genotypes  including the QTL. Correlations between the predicted and true breeding values for the three analyses and the four scenarios are in Table   which contains correlations for the non-genotyped animals  and Table   which contains the correlations for the genotyped animals. All three models had almost identical accuracies except when the number of observations exceeded the number of markers and the marker effects had a non-null mean. In this case  the model with centered marker covariates had a higher accuracy. The same accuracy could be achieved by including an extra covariate to model the mean of the breeding values. The results in this simulation indicate that this is necessary only when the number of observations exceeds the number of markers. When the number of markers greatly exceeds the number of observations  this extra covariate may become unnecessary even when the marker effects have a non-null mean. In most implementations of BR  a Gibbs sampler is used to draw inferences from the posterior distribution of the unknowns [      ]. This involves sampling from full-conditional posterior distributions. Sampling of fixed effects    is almost identical to sampling the marker effects  []. Thus  we will describe the strategy for sampling  directly. The most time-consuming task in a BR analysis is sampling  from its full-conditional distribution. Detailed derivation of these full-conditionals and illustrative R scripts are in Fernando and Garrick [] for BR models with complete genotype data. As shown in equation () of []  the first step in sampling  is adjusting  for all other effects in the model. In the case of equation ()    the vector of adjusted phenotypic values is: computed with the current values of    and . This vector is used to compute the right-hand-side for     which is needed to sample  in BayesA  BayesB and BayesC [  ]. In BayesB and BayesC   is either null or  conditional on the effect variance  normally distributed. Thus before  is sampled  a Bernoulli variable  is sampled that indicates whether  is null or is normally distributed. Sampling  requires computing the full-conditional probability that =1  which also requires   []. Calculation of    can be done more efficiently [] by initially computing: which is the vector  corrected for all effects in the model  using their current values. Then  before sampling   the right-hand-side for     is obtained efficiently as: and after sampling    is updated as: where  and  are the values of  before and after sampling. Then  sampling proceeds to the next locus. Thus for each marker covariate     is always computed  whereas in BayesB and BayesC  the vector  only needs to be updated when . In computing     the first term is the dot product of two vectors of length   the number of records. In the second term  the scalar  ' does not change from one round of sampling to the next  and so it is computed only once for each marker covariate. To speed-up computations  the dot product can be done in parallel  using the message passing interface (MPI) []. Suppose  processors are used for computing. Then  the first  elements of each covariate will be stored in memory of the first processor and the second set of  elements in the second processor and so on  where  is the whole part of   and the last processor gets the remaining elements. Similarly  blocks of  will also be stored with the  processors. Then  to compute   each of the -1 processors will do a dot product of length  and the last processor one of length =. Only the scalar result of the dot product from each processor needs to be communicated for the sampling and this will be relatively fast. After sampling   updating  will also be done in parallel. Before updating   the scalar  must be available to all  processors. Then  each processor will update its own block of  and will be ready for sampling the effect of the next marker covariate. The remaining calculations related to sampling marker effects do not depend on the number of records and will take only a negligible amount of time. Once the marker effects are sampled  sampling the locus-specific variances of marker effects in BayesA and BayesB  or the common variance in BayesC does not depend on the number of observations [  ]. To investigate the speedup from parallel computations  the Lonestar Linux cluster of the Texas Advanced Computing Center was used. According to the documentation at () a regular compute node on this cluster contains two Xeon Intel Hexa-Core 64-bit Westmere processors (12 cores in all) on a single board  as an SMP unit. The core frequency is 3.33 GHz and supports four floating-point operations per clock period  with a peak performance of 13.3 GFLOPS/core or 160 GFLOPS/node. Each node contains 24 GB of memory (2 GB/core). The memory subsystem has three channels from each processor’s memory controller to 3 DDR3 ECC DIMMS  running at 1333 MHz. The processor interconnect  QPI  runs at 6.4 GT/s. Initially  a data set with 1 million individuals and 5000 markers on each individual was used. Obtaining 100 samples of  and  for BayesC with =0 took 1167 seconds on a single core. By extrapolation  ignoring memory limitations  100 samples for 50 000 markers would take about 11 670 seconds on a single core. Next  MPI [] was used for parallel computation on 120 cores across 10 nodes. Then  obtaining 100 samples for 1 million individuals with 50 000 markers took 202 seconds. Thus  the speedup on 120 cores was about 58 times  and obtaining 40 000 samples would take about 22 hours. Using results from []  it can be shown that conditional on the sampled value of all other variables and the data  the conditional distribution of  is multivariate normal with mean  that is given by the solution to the following system: and covariance matrix: . The right-hand-side of equation () can be obtained efficiently as   where  is the current value of the sub-vector from equation () that corresponds to . A sample from this distribution can be obtained by using the blocking-Gibbs sampler described by Garcia-Cortes and Sorensen [  ]. This requires solving equation ()  which is very sparse  and can be done iteratively. Alternatively  a single-site Gibbs sampler can be used []. It can be shown that the full-conditional posterior for  is a scaled inverse chi-square distribution with scale parameter: and degrees of freedom   where  is the number of elements in []. The matrix  is very sparse  and thus computing  is fast. Here  we consider the situation where  is a “nuisance parameter” and interest is only on inference about marker effects: . The starting point for this sampler is the MME given by equation (). When =0 in the prior of marker effects of equation ()  conditional on the variance components in the model  the posterior for the location parameters is a normal distribution with mean given by the solution to these MME and covariance matrix given by the the inverse of the left-hand-side of the MME times []. Eliminating  from (23) results in the following MME: where . The solution to these MME for  and  are identical to those from equation (). Furthermore  the inverse elements of the left-hand-side of these MME are identical to the corresponding inverse elements of equation (). Thus  equation () can be used to draw samples from the posterior of  and . In BayesA and BayesC with =0  the blocking-Gibbs sampler of [] can be used to sample all effects jointly. In BayesB  BayesC and BayesC   the single-site sampler is more convenient. When the number of observations is larger than the number of effects in the model  equation (.12) of [] can be used to compute    efficiently  which is required to sample the  location effect from its full-conditional posterior distribution [  ] as: where  is the  element from the right-hand side of equation ()   ' is the  row from the left-hand side of equation ()  and  is the vector of sampled values of the fixed effects and marker effects. Once equation () is set up  the time for computing    as equation () does not depend on the number of observations. Thus  computing time for sampling  and  by either the blocking-Gibbs sampler or by the single-site sampler  using equation () to compute     does not depend the number on observations. Furthermore  when  is close to 1  the sampled value for most marker effects is null. Then  dramatic reductions in computing time can be achieved as described in the following. Sampling is started with   and so initially  the vector   =. As sampling proceeds and any non-null effect  is sampled     is updated as: and where  is the  column of . Then  before sampling      would be equal to equation (). In sampling marker effects  updating    using equation () is the only non-scalar computation  and when  is close to 1  the number of such updates can be very small. In such situations  40k samples of BayesB can be obtained on a single core in about half an hour  regardless of the number of observations. The most intensive computation in setting up equation () is that of  1'  and  2'. First  we consider computing the matrix of crossproducts:  2'. For an arbitrary matrix  of  rows and  columns  the crossproduct  can be written as: where  In equation ()  the crossproducts are independent and can be done in parallel. Next  we consider computing  1' . This can be undertaken in two steps. In step 1  the columns of =  are computed in parallel. Column  of this product can be written as: where  is the  column of . The second term in  can be computed efficiently as   where  is the solution to the sparse system: The Cholesky decomposition of this system is also sufficiently sparse for exact computation and has to be done only once. Once  is computed  in the second step  the product  1' = 1' can be computed in parallel  similar to equation ()  as the sum of independent matrix products. The Lonestar Linux cluster was used to examine the possible speedup that could be achieved by parallel computing of . Initially  a single core on this cluster was used to compute  with the number of rows in     equal to 1 million and the number of columns   equal to 5000. This computation took 11 669 seconds. If memory was not limiting  computation with  = 50 000 would take 100 times longer because now  would be 100 times larger than with =5000. Actual calculations with  = 50 000 were undertaken with 200 nodes. In each node   ' was computed with  being a slice containing a subset of the 50 000 rows of the  matrix. MPI [] was used to compute  as the sum of these matrices  as in equation (). The Eigen C++ template library []  which can exploit the multiple cores within a node  was used to compute  ' within each node. Although each node of the Lonestar cluster has 12 cores  using 8 cores within each node gave the best result: 912 seconds to compute . This was a speedup of about 1 279 times. Genomic prediction is based either on marker effects models (MEM)  where the effects of marker covariates are explicitly included in the model as random effects  or on breeding value models (BVM)  where the markers are used to compute the covariance matrix of the breeding values. Although BLUP using these two types of models can be identical []  computing using the BVM is more efficient when the number of marker covariates is much larger than the number of individuals. Furthermore  the BVM has also been used to combine information from genotyped and non-genotyped individuals to obtain BLUP in a single step (SSBV-BLUP) [    ]. SSBV-BLUP is based on the conditional covariance matrix    of  given both pedigree and observed marker genotypes. When this covariance matrix is written in terms of a single variance component  as in equation ()  a “base correction” is needed to ensure that relationships in  and  are expressed relative to the same base or founder population  as explained in detail by Meuwissen et al. []. In the MEM (20) presented here  the variance component  for  and  for  are kept separate. This strategy of keeping  and  separate can also be used in computing  by defining  as  instead of as . Legarra et al. [] and Christensen and Lund [] gave alternative derivations of the matrix . The derivation by Legarra et al. [] uses the identity given by equation ()  which was also used here to develop the MEM for single-step Bayesian regression. Here  we reasoned that if  has a multivariate normal distribution   and  would be independent because they are also uncorrelated. Furthermore  we assumed that when conditioning on the observed marker information  the change in the distribution of  results directly from the change in the distribution in . However  one might argue that this assumption is not reasonable because when you condition on the observed value of   the change in the distribution of  results from the correlated change in the distribution of  and not from the change in the distribution of . Christensen and Lund [] did not rely on equation () to derive   but they computed the mean of the missing genotypes conditional on the observed genotypes as: However  this is valid only for multivariate normal variables  and multivariate normality is not a good approximation for the distribution of marker covariates. They also used an expression for the conditional variance of the missing genotypes that is valid only for multivariate normal variables. They did not explicitly recognize these approximations in their derivation  but pointed out that the conditional distribution of breeding values of the non-genotyped animals will only be approximately normal. Similar reasoning was also used by de los Campos et al. [] who clearly showed that conditional on    has a mixture of scaled-multivariate normal densities. While we agree that conditional on    has a mixture of scaled-multivariate normal densities  it must be noted that even the unconditional distribution of  is only approximately normal. Furthermore  in G-BLUP  what is being conditioned on is not the observed value of  but the observed value of  2'. To see this  note that there are many different  matrices that result in the same matrix for   i.e.  2'  and thus the same G-BLUP breeding values. In other words  G-BLUP depends on  only through  2'  and therefore  all  that result in the same  2' will also result in the same G-BLUP. However   2' is proportional to the covariance matrix of . Thus  it would be correct to say that in G-BLUP  what is being conditioned on is the covariance matrix of  changing from being proportional to  to being proportional to  2'. This conditioning may be thought of as a selection process  where the unselected samples of  and  have a multivariate normal distribution with null mean and covariance matrix   while in the selected samples  selection based on  results in its mean still being null but its covariance matrix changing to . Then  the correlated change in  is given by equation ()  which is a result from Pearson [] that was also used by Henderson [] to develop theory for BLUP under a selection model. However  given the selection process that we have described  the distribution of  may not be multivariate normal. Hickey et al. [] imputed genotypes for non-genotyped individuals so that all individuals have genotypes for fitting a MEM. In their case  imputation was undertaken using linkage and linkage disequilibrium information. However  they did not account for any imputation residual. Liu et al. [] also have described a single-step MEM for combining information from genotyped and non-genotyped animals  which includes a residual polygenic component. Their analysis requires repeated multiplication of  by a vector  and an efficient algorithm has been developed for this multiplication. In another approach (Theo Meuwissen  personal communication  October 3  2013)  the LDMIP algorithm [] was used to impute missing genotypes  and for each SNP where the genotype of an individual  was not known with certainty  a random effect with covariance matrix  was fitted to account for the variability that is incompletely explained by the imputed genotype  where  is the linkage analysis based covariance matrix []. One of the advantages of this approach is that imputation of genotypes by LDMIP at a locus  uses information from the genotypes of all linked loci  in addition to the genotypes at locus . The implied imputation in SSBV-BLUP [–] and the method presented here  only uses genotypes at the current locus. Furthermore  best linear prediction is used for imputation  which is optimal only for normally distributed variables. In contrast  in LDMIP  conditional probabilities of the missing genotypes  given all observed genotypes at locus  and linked loci  that are computed approximately by iterative peeling and combine both linkage and LD information  are used to impute genotypes. Although the covariance matrix  is easier to justify than the covariance of  used here and in SSBV-BLUP  normality of the residuals of a single SNP covariate is more difficult to justify than normality of . Use of mixture genetic models [] addresses this weakness  but more work is needed to make these analyses efficient for routine use. The single-step Bayesian regression approach presented here and SSBV-BLUP have the same appealing property that phenotype  genotype and pedigree information are combined in a single-step. Unlike SSBV-BLUP  SSBR is not limited to normally distributed marker effects; SSBR can be used with -distributed marker effects  as in BayesA  and with mixture models  as in BayesB and BayesC . Furthermore  it has the advantage that matrix inversion is not required. However  this comes at the expense of using MCMC methods that are computationally intensive  but these methods have the advantage that computing time and memory requirements increase linearly with the number of observations and number of markers. Thus  as demonstrated here  computing clusters can be used to parallelize and speedup MCMC analyses for routine applications.

This work shows how the relationship matrix and its inverse can be developed for honey bee populations  and used to estimate breeding values and variance components. Currently  honey bees () draw a lot of public and scientific attention because of increased colony losses [] []  which are partly caused by infection with Varroa mites []. Although selection is a promising way to improve Varroa tolerance of honey bees  estimation of breeding values is not common practice in this species [] []. One reason is that it requires an organised collection of data on a relevant scale  which is rarely the case in honey bees. Currently  estimation of breeding values in honey bees is performed only in the German Beebreed program ()  for which breeding values are estimated from data that are collected annually on about 6000 colonies []. For specifics on the genetic evaluation method used in the Beebreed program that we refer to as BER for Bienefeld  Ehrhardt and Reinhardt  please see []. Methodology for breeding value estimation in honey bees has drawn the attention of animal breeders []-[]. They discussed the calculation of additive genetic relationships that account for the fact that the workers in a colony descend from a single diploid queen and 10 to 20 haploid drones. One approach that focused on the haplo-diploid nature of honey bees [] [] suggested that an allelic relationship matrix that contains relationships between gametes instead of between individuals  can be adapted to the specifics of honey bee ancestry. Another approach focused on the uncertainty about the father of an individual [] and suggested that methods developed for the use of mixed semen of sires can be adapted to honey bees. To our knowledge  these approaches have not been developed for implementation. Breeding value estimation with an animal model builds on the work of Henderson []  who derived the required inverse of the numerator relationship matrix using a decomposition of breeding values into Mendelian sampling terms. Because Mendelian sampling terms are mutually independent  the covariance matrix of these terms is diagonal  which facilitates inversion. However  it is not a diagonal matrix in honey bees []  because the paternal contribution to the additive genetic relationship differs between workers in the same colony and workers in different colonies. Bienefeld et al. [] solved this problem by using an approximation  in which both contributions are averaged and breeding values are estimated with an animal model. As a result  the matrix of Mendelian sampling terms is diagonal again  but the weighting of information of relatives is approximate. The purpose of this paper was to develop a method  referred to as BB (for Brascamp and Bijma)  to calculate the relationship matrix and its inverse for honey bee populations  in order to estimate breeding values and genetic parameters with an animal model. We used the approach of Henderson [] as a starting point to derive the required procedures  taking in account the biology of the reproduction in honey bees. We also summarize the BER method and provide insight into the quantitative differences between the BB and BER methods  using Monte Carlo simulation in a simple example. There are three types of individuals in honey bees: queens  workers and drones. Queens and workers are diploid  while drones are haploid. A colony of honey bees consists of a single fertilized queen  around ten thousand workers and several hundred drones. Workers contribute  for example  to the collection of pollen and nectar  the production of wax and nursing of the queen  but have no role in reproduction. Drones  in contrast  only serve for reproduction. The description of the reproduction cycle in honey bees starts with a virgin queen. Soon after emerging from the brood cell  the virgin queen leaves the colony (nuptial flight) to mate in flight with multiple drones that come essentially from other colonies. These drones concentrate in so-called drone congregation areas  bringing together queens and drones in a range as large as 10 km. Drones die immediately after mating  which means that they can mate to a single queen only. Queens are mated only during their nuptial flight  or perhaps during a few nuptial flights within a small time slot and they cannot be mated again later in life. The queen stores a life lasting stock of millions of sperm cells in her spermatheca. After returning to their colony  mated queens produce two types of eggs  fertilized and unfertilized eggs. Fertilized eggs usually develop into diploid workers  while unfertilized eggs develop into haploid drones. Occasionally  an offspring of a fertilized egg receives a special diet from the workers and as a consequence develops into a virgin queen  which means that both workers and a virgin queen develop from a fertilized egg. The haploid drones that develop from unfertilized eggs have no father. They can be considered as flying gametes  and produce cloned sperm (  all gametes produced by a drone are genetically identical). Controlled mating of queens requires control of drones  which is possible only by restricting the presence of drone-producing queens with a particular pedigree on isolated mating stations ( islands)  or by artificial insemination. Under normal circumstances  in a colony  drones are produced along with workers  but the production of drones can be stimulated by management measures. Note that queens are always mated to multiple drones  both with natural mating and artificial insemination. Thus  the worker progeny of a queen descend from multiple drones. This situation resembles that with mixed semen in the case of  pigs  for which the progeny of a sow derive from multiple boars. With respect to genetic relationships  the key difference between bees and mixed semen in pigs is that each piglet descends from a genetically unique paternal gamete  while subsets of the workers in a colony descend from the same drone and therefore from genetically identical paternal gametes. The Beebreed system is shown in Figure  (see reference []). On the maternal side  the pedigree is straightforward because each queen (  1a) has a single queen as mother (2a) but the paternal ( drone) side is more complex. A queen is mated to multiple drones that descend from a group of drone-producing queens (1b). These drone-producing queens descend from a single mother (4a)  which  in turn  has also been mated to drones that descend from a group of drone-producing queens (4b) with a single mother (12a). Note that  although drone-producing queens are also mated  the drones they produce contain genes of the queen only i.e. not of its mate.  Rectangles indicate fertilized queens with sperm cells in their spermatheca. The sperm cells derive from drones (small circles) produced by drone-producing queens (squares). The picture illustrates the pedigree of queen 1a in a colony with workers that derive from the queen and the sperm cells in the spermatheca. The numbers 1a-12a given to queens and 1b-4b given to drone-producing queens are those used in the Beebreed system. Drones cannot be not traced and it is unknown how many and which drones have mated to the queen. As a consequence  the contribution of each drone-producing queen to the offspring of the queen is unknown. For this reason  the group of drone-producing queens can be treated as a single “individual”  which we will refer to as the sire of the workers of the colony. In Figure   for example  the three drone-producing queens in 1b together constitute the sire of the workers in the colony of queen 1a. By grouping the drone-producing queens into a single sire  each individual in the pedigree has precisely two parents  a queen and a sire. This grouping makes it easier to trace the pedigree without loss of information. Observations in honey bees are on colony performance  and may relate to traits like honey production  behaviour and disease resistance []. The performance of a colony is affected by the joint genetic effects of the ten thousand workers (called worker effect) and by the genetic effects of the queen (called queen effect). Colony performance results from the action of the workers and the interaction between workers  but also from the effects of the queen on the workers  for example  due to the number of workers produced or by producing pheromones that affect worker behaviour. However  workers also affect the behaviour of the queen. Despite these different interactions  the performance of a colony can be partitioned into an additive worker effect and an additive queen effect  based on the principle of least squares []. Conceptually  this is similar to defining the average effect of an allele for a locus showing dominance  and to maternal effects in mammals []. Several studies [] [] have shown that the contribution of queen effects to colony performance is considerable  although smaller than that of worker effects  while the genetic correlation between worker and queen effects is negative. In the following paragraphs  we consider three types of individuals: (i) queens  (ii) sires  and (iii) groups of workers in a colony  referred to as worker groups. Queens are single individuals  while sires and worker groups are aggregates of individuals. With this categorisation  we cover individuals responsible for the phenotypes (queens and worker groups) and individuals in the pedigree (queens and sires). To emphasize that worker groups and sires consist of groups of individuals  we will write their breeding values as averages  using   while using  for the breeding value of a queen. Since breeding values are to be estimated on all three categories  the size of the numerator relationship matrix will be twice the number of queens (because each colony has one queen and one worker group) plus the number of sires. The performance of a colony    can be written as the sum of a worker effect    a queen effect    and a non-heritable residual   : where  is the average breeding value of the worker group for worker effect  and  the breeding value of the dam of workers    the queen in the colony  for queen effect. Thus  superscript  denotes the worker effect  superscript  the queen effect  and subscript  denotes a colony   the worker group of the colony  and  the queen of the colony. Equation () shows that the expected colony performance is equal to the sum of the queen effect and the worker effect. Candidates for selection are the queens of the colonies  either to produce the next generation of queens  or to produce the next generation of sires. It is important to realize that the queens were mated early in life and cannot be re-mated  which means that selection focuses on the combination of a queen and the drones it was mated to. This situation clearly differs from the usual situation in animal breeding  where parents of both sexes are selected separately and mated afterwards. Thus  when selecting queens  the criterion of interest is the estimated breeding value of an average female offspring of a mated queen  say   which equals the estimated breeding value of the workers in the queen’s colony: Here  we consider a single trait situation  where each observation is affected by the worker effect of the worker group in the colony and the queen effect of the queen in the colony. Thus  observations on colonies are modelled as: where  is the vector of observations on colonies   a vector of fixed effects with incidence matrix    a vector of worker effects with incidence matrix    a vector of queen effects with incidence matrix   and  a vector of residuals. In both methods BB and BER   and  simply contain 1’s to connect the breeding value to the observation. In Equation ()  the residual includes the non-genetic effects due to both the queen and its workers. However  since a queen has only one colony throughout its life and workers contribute to a single colony only  those two non-genetic effects can be combined into a single residual that is independent between colonies: . Estimates of the fixed effects and breeding values are obtained by solving the following mixed model equations []: Where  is the numerator relationships matrix and Here  and  are the additive genetic variances for worker and queen effect  respectively  and  is the genetic correlation between these effects. In the next section  we develop the method to derive  that is needed in Equation (). Henderson [] derived a simple method to compute the inverse of a numerator relationship matrix. Consider the breeding value  of individual   which is the sum of half the breeding value of its father    half the breeding value of its mother    and a Mendelian sampling term    In matrix notation  the breeding values of all individuals in the pedigree may be represented by a vector   such that: where  is a matrix connecting an individual to its parents  with offspring on the rows and parents on the columns. The row for an offspring contains two ½’s when both parents are known  one ½ when only one parent is known  and all 0’s when no parents are known. The vector  contains the Mendelian sampling terms. Let  denote the covariance matrix of   the numerator relationship matrix  and  the covariance matrix of . Under normal diploid inheritance  which is the most common in animal breeding   is a diagonal matrix because the Mendelian sampling terms for different individuals are independent of each other. From Equation ()  the vector of Mendelian sampling terms can be written as  = ( - ). It follows that  = ( - )  and consequently  = (( - ) ) = ( - ) ( - ). Taking the inverse yields: Equation () is used as the basis for a simple method to invert []  because  and  are simple matrices and  is a diagonal matrix for most livestock species. Equations () through () hold for honey bees as well  but  is no longer a diagonal matrix. In the following  we derive the diagonals and off-diagonals of   considering the three types of individuals defined above: queens  sires and worker groups. Because  is the same for all traits of interest  we do not distinguish between worker and queen effects  and therefore drop the  and  superscripts. The breeding value of a queen  say   can be decomposed into parental terms and a Mendelian sampling deviation: The interesting feature is in the diagonal element of  for queens  which is given by: where  is the additive genetic variance in the base population. The () follows from writing the variance of Equation () and solving the resulting expression for (). Taking the variance of Equation () yields: where  denotes the coefficient of inbreeding. Note that var() denotes the variance of the breeding value for the individual of interest  whereas  in Equation () denotes additive genetic variance in the base population. The variance of the breeding value of the sire in Equation () is given by: where  is the number of drone-producing queens constituting a sire   the inbreeding coefficient of the drone-producing queens  and  the additive genetic relationship between those drone-producing queens. Because all drone-producing queens within a sire have the same pedigree (Figure )  they all have the same value for  and . Furthermore    so that  cancels from Equation (). Finally  solving this equation for () yields (Appendix 1): The first component in Equation () represents the variance due to the Mendelian sampling of maternal gametes  the second one the variance due to the Mendelian sampling of gametes of an individual drone-producing queen  and the third one the variance due to the sampling among drone-producing queens. Note that this equation can be applied when both parents of individual  are known. If this is not the case  refer to Appendix 1. The breeding value of a sire can be decomposed into parental terms and a sampling deviation: Since a sire is a group of  (drone-producing) queens  the  in Equation () is the average of  individual d values as defined by Equation (): Taking the variance of Equation () shows that the sampling variance for sires equals: where () is given by Equation (). (Since all  have the same variance  we dropped subscript  in ()). Usually  in animal breeding  Mendelian sampling terms of individuals are independent because each individual descends from unique gametes  so that (  ) = 0. For example  in pigs for which mixed semen is used  two offspring born from the same artificial insemination of a sow have independent Mendelian sampling terms because they derive from different gametes. In that case  the covariance between sibs is completely taken care of by the pedigree  as described by the term  in Equation ()  so that (  ) = 0. The situation is different in the honey bee  because a drone produces clonal sperm that consists of identical gametes. As a consequence  two offspring of the same drone derive from identical paternal gametes  and therefore have identical paternal Mendelian sampling terms. Offspring can descend from the same drone if and only if they have the same mother  because drones can mate only once. Since drone-producing queens within a sire have the same mother  they may descend from the same drone. Thus  the paternal covariance between two drone-producing queens within the same sire  say  and   arises not only because they share a common sire (a drone-producing queen)  but also because they may descend from the same drone. The size of the covariance between the Mendelian sampling terms of two offspring of the same queen and sire combination  which can be written as (  ) = ()  where subscript  denotes full-sibs  is discussed in the next paragraph. Here we only rewrite Equation () to become: where () is given by Equation (). The diagonal elements for sires are equal to: Since worker groups and sires are groups of individuals that descend from a single mother  the decomposition of the breeding value of a worker group is the same as for a sire (Equation ()). Analogous to Equation ()  the variance of the average sampling deviation of the ten thousand workers in a colony can be written as    denoting the number of workers in a colony. Since  is very large  it follows that: Hence  Equation () shows that the worker group has a non-zero sampling term merely because workers may descend from the same drone; otherwise  would average to zero. Finally  diagonal elements for worker groups follow from Equation (). Off-diagonal elements of  occur only between individuals that derive from the same queen and sire combination and are given by (see above Equation ()): In honey bees  full-sibs are the offspring of the mating between a queen and a sire. Within a colony  some pairs of workers are full-sibs in the ordinary sense (when they descend from a common queen and a common drone-producing queen  but from different drones) with an additive genetic relationship of   ignoring inbreeding. A pair may also descend from the same drone  resulting in   or from different drone-producing queens  resulting in . Usually in animal breeding  the covariance between breeding values of relatives is fully accounted for by the pedigree. In general  however  this requires two conditions. The first condition is that  conditional on the pedigree  Mendelian sampling terms of offspring are independent. In honey bees this is not the case for full-sibs  because they may descend from the same drone  in which case their paternal Mendelian sampling terms are identical. The second condition is that the pedigree fully accounts for the contributions of parents to offspring. Usually in animal breeding  this condition is met  because a parent contributes precisely half the genes of an offspring. However in a honey bee pedigree  this condition is not met because the sire is an aggregate of multiple drone-producing queens and the contribution of individual drone-producing queens to offspring varies among the drone-producing queens that constitute a sire. This will occur by chance  even when the  expected contribution is the same for all drone-producing queens that make-up a sire but the pedigree accounts for only the average contribution of a drone-producing queen to the offspring  which is given by the  in Equations () and (). Variation among drone-producing queens in their contribution to offspring creates a paternal covariance among full-sibs that exceeds the  that is accounted for by the pedigree  and thus creates a covariance between the d terms of full-sibs. Thus  the d terms of full-sibs may be correlated because (i) sibs may descend from the same drone  and (ii) the contribution to offspring may vary among drone-producing queens. Let  denote the probability that two full-sibs descend from the same drone  and  the probability that they descend from the same drone-producing queen (including the case where they descend from the same drone  so  > ). The first term in equation () arises from the probability that two full-sibs descend from the same drone. The second term arises from variation in the contribution of individual drone-producing queens to offspring  around the expected value of . Thus  in the second term  the  term represents subtraction of the covariance already accounted for by the pedigree. Both  and  depend on variation in contributions of parents to offspring. For   suppose that the  drone contributes a fraction  to the offspring of the queen  so that   where  denotes the number of drones that mate to a queen. Then  the probability that two full-sibs descend from the same drone is . Since   this can be written as: where  is the variation among the drones that mated to the queen in their contributions to its offspring. This result shows that variation in contributions among drones increases the covariance among full-sibs. Analogously  for drone-producing queens  it follows that: where  is the variation among the drone-producing queens in their contributions to the offspring of the queen (thus  and ). Equations () to () are valid irrespective of the distribution of the contributions of drones and drone-producing queens to offspring. In other words   and  do not depend on the details of that distribution  but only on the variance. In practical applications  empirical values for  and  may be used. However  when such values are not available  the expected values of  and  may be derived under the assumption that the number of offspring of a parent follows a Poisson distribution  which is the default distribution for family size in population biology. Assuming that the number of offspring of a drone follows a Poisson distribution  it follows that (see Appendix 2): where  denotes the total number of offspring of a queen. Since  is very large   will be close to  when family size follows a Poisson distribution. Moreover  when the number of drones of a single drone-producing queen that mates to the queen follows a Poisson distribution and the number of offspring per drone is large  then it follows that (Appendix 2): Substituting those values into Equation () yields: Finally  off-diagonals of  are obtained from substituting Equation () into Equation (). Thus  when the number of offspring per parent follows a Poisson distribution  the covariance between Mendelian sampling terms of full-sibs depends only on the relatedness between drone-producing queens () and on the number of drones mated to a queen. Under the assumption that the number of drones of a single drone-producing queen that mates to the queen follows a Poisson distribution  there is no covariance between sampling deviations of paternal half sibs (  between two offspring of the same sire but of a different queen; see Discussion). Whether the assumption of a Poisson distribution is realistic will be addressed in the Discussion. In method BER   was used  assuming equal contribution of each drone to the progeny. To obtain   a Poisson distribution was not assumed but the total probability that full-sibs descend from different drones i.e.    was partitioned into a fraction  for the same drone-producing queen  and a fraction  for different drone-producing queens. In that case  the probability that two full-sibs descend from the same drone-producing queen equals  (the probability that two progeny descend from the same drone) plus  (the probability that two progeny descend from the same drone-producing queen but from two different drones)  which gives a total probability of: which differs from the  for a Poisson distribution by an amount equal to . Replacing  in Equation () by  yields: Note that the BER method does not implement off-diagonal elements in  (see below); here  we merely present Equation () to show the outcome of () for the  proposed by []. Note that for S-1 approaching S  Equation () approaches (). Calculation of the elements of  requires additive genetic relationships between drone-producing queens    and inbreeding coefficients  . These values can be obtained recursively when proceeding in the pedigree  starting with the oldest individuals. For sires from the base generation of the pedigree  it is reasonable to take  = 0  because their dams can be considered as unrelated just like the drones they are mated to. For later generations   builds up stepwise according to: In this equation  the first term represents the additive genetic relationship between drone-producing queens because they descend from the same dam  the second term relates to the case when they descend from the same drone  which has probability  and a paternal relatedness of   the third term relates to the case when they descend from the same drone-producing queen but from a different drone  which has probability ( - ) and a paternal relatedness of   the fourth term relates to the case when they descend from different drone-producing queens  which has probability (1 - ) and a paternal relatedness of   and the last term accounts for the additive genetic relationship between dam and sire of the drone-producing queens. With a Poisson distribution for the numbers of drones and drone-producing queens mating to the queen   and  (Equations () and ())  so that Equation () becomes: When substituting the  of BER  its expression being given by Equation () here  into Equation () we get: Inbreeding coefficients can be derived from the additive genetic relationship between the sire and the dam of individual  as: As a result   is a block-diagonal matrix  each block representing the offspring of a single queen   the combination of a queen and a sire. Chronologically  such a block starts with a single individual  being the worker group that descends from that queen. When the queen is selected to breed new queens  the queens in its progeny will be added to the block. Moreover  when the queen is selected to breed drone-producing queens  then one or more sires will be added to the block. The size of a block  therefore  equals 1 plus the number of queens plus the number of sires that descend from the mother queen. Thus  a block contains at maximum three distinct diagonal values  one for the worker group  one for queens  and one for sires. All off-diagonals within a block are equal  and equal to the diagonal element for the worker group (Equation ()). Off-diagonals outside blocks are 0. Since  is a block-diagonal matrix  the inverse of  is also a block-diagonal matrix  each block being the inverse of the corresponding block of . Since blocks of  have a specific structure  with at maximum three distinct values   can be obtained analytically    with the help of equation-solving software such as Mathematica []. However  since blocks of  can have different numbers of queens and sires  there are multiple analytical solutions  each of which is a complicated expression. Therefore  since the size of the blocks is usually small  numerical inversion of each block is easy and more practical and  thus  we do not present the analytical inversion of  here. The main methodological problem addressed in [] [] is that the additive genetic relationship that can be attributed to the sire differs between two workers in  colony versus two workers in  colonies. This difference arises because workers within a colony partly descend from the same drone  whereas workers in different colonies must derive from different drones. In the BER method  these two additive genetic relationships are replaced by a single additive genetic relationship  the square root of which is the path coefficient  between a sire and the workers descending from this sire. Consequently  breeding values are estimated using: The approach used by Bienefeld  Ehrhardt and Reinhardt [] consists of two steps. In the first step  the asymptotic value of the additive genetic relationship between full-sibs is calculated by ignoring inbreeding and the additive genetic relationship between dam and sire. The asymptotic value is obtained by solving the equilibrium condition  in Equation ()  together with  =  =  = 0. Numerically  the asymptotic value of   denoted by   is approached closely within a few generations []. Then  the paternal component of the additive genetic relatedness between workers in the same colony is obtained by subtracting the maternal component  . Because full-sibs can descend from the same drone  the resulting value differs from the additive genetic relationship between paternal half sibs (i.e.  workers in different colonies)  which is . In the second step of the BER method  both relationships are replaced by their mean  i.e. and the additive genetic relationship between a worker and its sire is calculated as the square root of this mean  i.e. Then   and  follow from the model in Equation (). In   the row for an offspring has  in the column for its mother (the queen) and  in the column for its father (the sire). Matrix  is assumed to be diagonal with elements  that equal: when both parents are known (Appendix 1). This result shows that  includes not only the Mendelian sampling variance but also a component due to the difference between  and . In the BER method  both the sire and the worker group are treated as single individuals  not as virtual individuals that consist of a group of individuals. As a consequence  the diagonal elements of  are neither affected by the number of drone-producing queens nor by the number of drones involved in mating  so that the sampling variances are computed in the same manner as those of queens. Note that in []  the breeding value of an individual is described as: where the term  is a correction to account for the fact that offspring inherit less than 50% of their genes from the sire in Equation (). In the current implementation of breeding value estimation in the Beebreed program   represents the average breeding value of sires of a particular year (Ehrhardt K  2013  personal communication). This correction is essential to properly account for genetic trend when parents are selected across years. The purpose of the simulation was to study properties of estimated breeding values from the BER and BB methods  and to compare the estimated breeding values. In the simulation  breeding values are generated for three types of individuals  queens  sires and worker groups  and subsequently the phenotypes for colonies are generated. Table  illustrates the selection scheme. Two-year-old tested queens produce the next generation of virgin queens. Just after birth  these virgin queens are mated to sires. The sires descend from queens that are three years old at birth of the virgin queens. In the actual Beebreed program  the dams may also produce offspring at an older age but Table  illustrates the most frequent situation. Table  also illustrates that sires on mating stations (or with artificial insemination) are mated to groups of full-sib queens. At two years of age each queen produces a colony observation that is added to the data to estimate breeding values. The basic simulation starts with NSY (number of sires per year) base sires generated in years 1  2 and 3  and NQY (number of queens per year) base queens generated in years 2 and 3. The base queens were simulated as full-sib groups with NQ (number of full-sibs per group) individuals each because that is also the structure in future generations. Sires from years 1 and 2 are mated randomly to queens in years 2 and 3 with an equal number of NFQ mates for each sire  each producing NQ full-sibs. From year 4  the NSY queens with the highest estimated breeding value according to Equation () are selected to produce the next generation of sires. The NSYxNFQ queens with the highest estimated breeding value are selected to produce NQ queens each. Allocation of mates (sires) to queens is random  but each queen within a full-sib group is mated to the same sire and each sire is mated to the same number of queens. The queens that will produce sires are therefore selected NSY out of NQY  and the queens that will produce queens are selected 1 out of NQ. Two breeding values are simulated for each individual  a breeding value for the worker effect and a breeding value for the queen effect. To allow for a correlation between these two breeding values  random samples for an individual are taken from a bivariate normal distribution (using the function mvrnorm from the package MASS in R; ). Because Mendelian sampling terms are correlated between offspring of the same queen  sampling terms were constructed as the sum of two independent components: a component specific to each individual and a component common to all offspring of the same queen. For the  queen belonging to the  dam family  the two breeding values were generated as: where  is a sample from a standard bivariate normal distribution with correlation   which was sampled once for each dam family (hence the subscript ). The  is another sample from the same distribution  independent of the previous  which was sampled once for each individual queen (hence the subscript ). Thus  the second term on the right-hand side of Equation () is common to all offspring of the same dam family  whereas the third term is specific to each individual offspring. The () denotes the sampling variance common to all offspring of dam family   superscripts  and  denoting the queen and worker effect respectively  and was obtained from Equation ()  assuming proportional contributions of sires and drones according to the BER method. The term () - () in Equation () represents the remaining sampling variation for an individual queen after subtracting the variance common to all offspring of the same dam  i.e. (). The () in Equation () was taken from Equation (). For the  sire belonging to the  dam family  the two breeding values were generated as where only the last term differs from Equation () and  was taken from Equation (). For worker groups  the individual sampling deviation is practically 0 because of the large numbers of individuals in a worker group (Equation ()). Since a queen has only a single worker group  in Equation () subscript  can be replaced by   so that the two breeding values for the worker group belonging to the  dam family were generated as: When a sire  queen or worker descended from the same dam  then the values of  in Equations () through () are identical for those individuals. Based on Equation ()  colony observations were generated as: where  is a sample from a univariate standard normal distribution. Using the simulated data and pedigree  the inverse numerator relationship matrix  (Equation ()) was created using either method BB or method BER  and breeding values were estimated by solving Equation (). The criterion to select queens to produce the next generation of queens and sires for method BB is given by Equation (). For method BER  the factor of  for the estimated breeding value of the sire in Equation () is replaced by . To evaluate the effect of selection using the two methods  we analysed the effect on the true breeding value of unfertilized queens (the breeding goal)  which were simulated as: which is the sum of the dam’s and the sire’s breeding value for worker and queen effects  plus Mendelian sampling. The Mendelian sampling consists of a term common to all offspring of the pair of dam and sire  using the common values for  and   and a residual sampling term  as in Equation (). Parameter values used in the simulation were  = 1   = 0.5   = 2 and  = -0.5  which are in line with estimates reported by []. Based on []  the number of drone-producing queens that constitute a sire (S) was equal to 8 and the number of drones mating to a queen (D) was equal to 12. We analysed the simulated data for a small example  in which the only fixed effect was the mean. NSY was equal to 5  the number of full-sib groups to which a sire is mated (NFQ) was equal to 5 and NQ was fixed at 3. We simulated 20 years of data  including colony performance of queens born in year 20. First  the properties of estimated breeding values (EBV) were investigated using 1000 replicated schemes without selection. The quality of EBV was judged by the regression coefficient of the true ( simulated) breeding value (TBV) on the EBV and by the correlation coefficient between TBV and EBV in year 20. We chose those criteria because the regression coefficient of TBV on EBV should be equal to 1 with BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction)  while response to selection on EBV is proportional to the correlation coefficient. We did not implement the correction factor  from Equation ()  since this does not affect results because regression and correlation coefficients were calculated within one generation. Second  we compared response to selection between the two methods  again using 1000 replicates. Because selection took place within years (non-overlapping generations)  we did not implement the correction factor of Equation () here either  since it did not affect results. Table  gives the regression coefficients of TBV (simulated) on EBV from 1000 replicates of simulation. The results with method BB were according to theory: regression coefficients of TBV on EBV were very close to 1  not only for year 20  but also for preceding years (results not shown). With method BER  regression coefficients deviated from 1 and  in early years  from the stable values reached in later years. For queens  the regression coefficient for the EBV for the queen effect was larger than 1  which means that the variance in EBV was too small  i.e. positive TBV were underestimated and negative TBV were overestimated. Thus  the BER method shrinks the EBV too much towards the mean. Also the regression coefficients for sires in year 20 were larger than 1  although with a large standard deviation. The regression coefficients for colonies were much lower than 1  which is primarily a variance issue: in the BER method  colonies are treated as single individuals so that their variance is taken to be equal to that of a queen  while in fact it is much smaller due to the averaging of Mendelian sampling terms. Response to selection depends on the accuracy of the estimated values for the breeding objective given by Equation ()  in pairs of queens and sires that are candidates to be selected to breed future queens. To get an impression of possible responses to selection using the two methods  we studied the correlations between the TBV (simulated) and EBV for the breeding objective. Results are in Table  and show that  for this simple example  the correlations with methods BB and BER were fairly similar. Across years  correlations differed by nearly 10% between both methods. Although the EBV obtained with the BER method were not unbiased  while those with the BB method were  the animals ranked similarly. Responses to selection are also in Table . The annual responses to selection started slowly in early years and remained somewhat irregular in later years. There was a strong similarity in results for the two methods in that respect. This irregularity is caused by the structure of the simulation. The simulation started with the simulation of base sires in years 1 to 3 and base queens in years 2 and 3. A first batch of offspring (born in year 4) is produced from base sires of year 1 and base queens of year 2 and a second batch (born in year 5) from base sires of year 2 and base queens of year 3. Genetically  progeny of these batches of offspring mixed in later years due to the fact that the dams of the sires were three years old at birth of the next generation of queens  while the dams were two years old at birth of the next generation of queens. However  this mixing developed fairly slowly and was delayed by the fact that pairs of queens and sires were selected to produce the next generation. Similar results have been observed in simulations of breeding schemes with overlapping generations in dairy cattle []. The cumulative selection response differed little between the two methods BB and BER but were 5% higher with method BB compared to method BER in years 8 to 10  and 4% higher in years 18 to 20. In this paper  we derived a method to calculate the relationship matrix and its inverse for honey bee populations  which is required to estimate breeding values and genetic parameters. The situation in honey bees differs from the usual situation in farm animal breeding  because of the honey bees’ mode of reproduction. The first major difference is that two full-sibs may carry identical paternal gametes. This occurs because sires (drone-producing queens) produce drones which may be considered as flying gametes that produce many identical sperm cells. Because a drone can mate to a single queen only  paternal half-sibs always carry different paternal gametes. Consequently  the paternal contribution to the additive genetic relationship between full-sibs differs from that between half-sibs  which results in a block diagonal  matrix of covariances between Mendelian sampling terms. Off-diagonals of those blocks equal the covariance between sampling terms of full-sibs. The second difference is that selection candidates (queens) are mated early in life  before they can be selected as parents. As a consequence  selection is not of individual dams but of matings from which breeding stock can be produced after the estimation of breeding values. Thus  the selection target is the breeding value of a future queen from this mating  which equals half the breeding values of both mates plus the part of Mendelian sampling that is common to all progeny of these mates. This also implies that the EBV of such a future queen equals the EBV of the colony. Another difference from traditional animal breeding is that the “father” of a queen is usually unknown because the drones that mate with the queen come from multiple drone-producing queens. In this context  our work follows that of Dempfle []  who discussed the consequences of mixed semen for the estimation of breeding values  rather than focussing on the haploid nature of the drones [] []. Equation () gives a general expression for the covariance of the Mendelian sampling terms of full-sibs. This covariance depends on the variance of the number of offspring per drone (Equation ()) and the variance of the number of drones per drone-producing queen (Equation ()). Without further knowledge  a Poisson distribution of family sizes is a common choice  which leads to Equation (). Numerically  this equation differs very little from Equation ()  which results from substituting the probabilities from the BER method (Equation ()) into Equation ()  but these probabilities do not have a theoretical basis. However in reality  the assumption of a Poisson distribution of family sizes does not seem to hold  since a review of the literature [] suggests that the proportion of progeny descending from different drones deviates from Poisson. Furthermore  results of an experiment using drone-producing colonies each producing a similar number of drones  suggested that drone-producing queens that contribute a higher proportion of drones to matings also produce drones with a higher proportion of offspring in colonies []. The Poisson distribution arises when variation in contributions is entirely by chance    when a priori the expected number of offspring is equal for each drone-producing queen and for each drone. When there are systematic differences between drone-producing queens or drones in the expected number of offspring  then the variance in contributions will be larger than in the case of a Poisson distribution  which implies a larger covariance between sampling terms of full-sibs. Numerically  this effect may be neutralised by assuming a smaller number of drones    by using an effective number of drones rather than the actual number of drones. Note that in this context  [] used a number of drones equal to 12  while a consensus number is around 16 []. When assuming a Poisson distribution  the covariance between Mendelian sampling terms for half sibs is 0. This is  however  not true if some drone-producing queens are systematically more successful to contribute drones to matings []. In practice  in the Beebreed program  inbreeding coefficients are computed for possible planned matings that are not yet included in the pedigree (). Efficient methods to compute inbreeding coefficients have been derived [] []  based on []. These methods exploit the fact that the  matrix is a diagonal matrix. We derived a modification to []  which takes into account the fact that the  matrix contains off-diagonal elements in the bee breeding case. This method  however  requires the whole pedigree of an individual to be searched for the occurrence of parents that are full-sibs  which may be very time-consuming. As an alternative  the  matrix of the pedigree may be kept in memory such that the required inbreeding coefficients can be used in Equation (). In the development of the methods and analyses presented here  we used the current mating system applied in the Beebreed program as a starting point. This implies that drone-producing queens are full-sibs from a shared dam and sire. That may not be the case for parts of the pedigree or for other programs. For those cases  we suggest to include the individual drone-producing queens in the pedigree  with diagonal elements in  equal to those of individual queens  combining Equations () and (). Elements in  then need to be adapted to reflect the fractions that are contributed by these individual drone-producing queens. Without prior knowledge on these fractions  we suggest to use equal fractions as an approximation  although this may not be true in reality [] []. We have presented methodology to construct the relationship matrix and its inverse for honey bee populations  which is required in the mixed model equations used for the estimation of breeding values and genetic parameters. The method allows for different assumptions on the contribution of drones and drone-producing queens to offspring  and is exact if those assumptions are correct. The method yields EBV that are unbiased predictors of TBV. We also carried out an exploratory comparison with the BER method [] that is currently used in practice and weighs information on relatives  differently. Although EBV obtained with the BER method were biased  selection candidates were ranked similar to those of our method and the response to selection was only slightly lower than with our method. This suggests that suboptimal weighting of information from relatives has limited impact on the ranking of selection candidates. It remains to be seen whether this conclusion extends to the estimation of genetic parameters. EWB had the initial idea of looking into the estimation of genetic parameters in honey bees based on the theoretical framework of Bienefeld [] for breeding value estimation. PB suggested focusing on this theoretical framework which led to this paper with a focus on breeding value estimation. EWB and PB jointly developed the theory and wrote the paper  with EWB writing the first draft. EWB designed the simulation and programmed it in R. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript. In this Appendix  first we derive Equation ()  the Mendelian sampling variance for queens with known parents for method BB. Subsequently  we derive the variances when parents are unknown  for queens and sires. Finally  we repeat all steps for method BER. Equation numbers between brackets refer to equations in the main text. The model describing the breeding value of a queen is: such that the variance of the breeding value can be written as: Because   and furthermore: it follows that: To rearrange this to a biologically useful form we replace: which gives: When both parents are unknown the following situations can be distinguished: A queen with unknown parents (base queen). In that case    =   and so . A sire with unknown parents (base sire). In that case   and   because the drone-producing queens constituting the sire are assumed to be unrelated. An individual with a known dam but an unknown sire. In that case   and  such that . An individual with an unknown dam  but a known sire. Then   and  and after some rearrangement: . A sire with an unknown dam and a known sire. This is very unlikely because it implies that a sire is bred from a dam for which neither pedigree nor breeding values are available. Nevertheless  in that case  and   as when both parents are known with   as under point 4 of this paragraph  such that  where ( ) is as under point 4 and  as before  when both parents are known. Therefore  . A sire with a known dam and an unknown sire. This also seems odd. Nevertheless  in that case   and  with   as under point 3. Now    with ( ) as under point 3. Covariances between   and   are equal to 0 because no covariance due to drones is involved. The model that describes the breeding value of a queen  and also of a sire or colony equals: Therefore Note that . Taking this into account it follows that: and When neither the dam nor the sire is known . In the case when only the dam is known   and . In the case when only the sire is known   =  +   and . Here  we derive the probability  that two offspring of a queen descend from the same drone  and the probability  that two offspring descend from the same drone-producing queen  under the assumption that the number of drones per drone-producing queen and the number of offspring per drone follow a Poisson distribution. Take the average number of drones per drone-producing queen to be equal to  and the average number of offspring per drone to be equal to . Furthermore  take the total number of offspring per sire to be equal to   such that  =  and the number of offspring per drone-producing queen to be equal to . The average number of drones is equal to   such that the average number of offspring per drone equals . Furthermore  because the number of offspring per drone follows a Poisson distribution: The proportion of offspring that derives from a particular drone is . It follows that . Using: it follows that: because  is very large. The average number of drones per drone-producing queen equals . This number follows a Poisson distribution such that . We have defined  as the proportion of offspring from a particular drone-producing queen  where on average   using  = . With this result  because  is very large. The derivation assumes that  and  are independent. This is a reasonable assumption: the number of offspring of a drone is independent of the number of drones produced by its dam. Using  ()  it follows that: Ghazoul J: Buzziness as usual? Questioning the global pollination crisis. Trends Ecol Evol. 2005  20: 367-373. 10.1016/j.tree.2005.04.026.

"Quantitative analysis of low-density SNP data for parentage assignment and estimation of family contributions to pooled samples"	"Authors: John M Henshall  Leanne Dierens and Melony J Sellars"	"CSIRO Food Futures National Research Flagship  CSIRO Animal  Food and Health Sciences  Armidale  2350  NSW  AustraliaJohn M Henshall CSIRO Food Futures National Research Flagship  CSIRO Animal  Food and Health Sciences  St Lucia  Qld  4067  AustraliaLeanne Dierens CSIRO Food Futures National Research Flagship  CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research  Dutton Park  Qld  4102  AustraliaMelony J Sellars"	"No Co-Author"	"2 September 2014"	"BackgroundWhile much attention has focused on the development of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays  the costs of developing and running low-density assays have fallen dramatically. This makes it feasible to develop and apply SNP assays for agricultural species beyond the major livestock species. Although low-cost low-density assays may not have the accuracy of the high-density assays widely used in human and livestock species  we show that when combined with statistical analysis approaches that use quantitative instead of discrete genotypes  their utility may be improved. The data used in this study are from a 63-SNP marker Sequenom® iPLEX Platinum panel for the Black Tiger shrimp  for which high-density SNP assays are not currently available.ResultsFor quantitative genotypes that could be estimated  in 5% of cases the most likely genotype for an individual at a SNP had a probability of less than 0.99. Matrix formulations of maximum likelihood equations for parentage assignment were developed for the quantitative genotypes and also for discrete genotypes perturbed by an assumed error term. Assignment rates that were based on maximum likelihood with quantitative genotypes were similar to those based on maximum likelihood with perturbed genotypes but  for more than 50% of cases  the two methods resulted in individuals being assigned to different families. Treating genotypes as quantitative values allows the same analysis framework to be used for pooled samples of DNA from multiple individuals. Resulting correlations between allele frequency estimates from pooled DNA and individual samples were consistently greater than 0.90  and as high as 0.97 for some pools.

This makes it feasible to develop and apply SNP assays for agricultural species beyond the major livestock species. Although low-cost low-density assays may not have the accuracy of the high-density assays widely used in human and livestock species  we show that when combined with statistical analysis approaches that use quantitative instead of discrete genotypes  their utility may be improved. The data used in this study are from a 63-SNP marker Sequenom® iPLEX Platinum panel for the Black Tiger shrimp  for which high-density SNP assays are not currently available. For quantitative genotypes that could be estimated  in 5% of cases the most likely genotype for an individual at a SNP had a probability of less than 0.99. Matrix formulations of maximum likelihood equations for parentage assignment were developed for the quantitative genotypes and also for discrete genotypes perturbed by an assumed error term. Assignment rates that were based on maximum likelihood with quantitative genotypes were similar to those based on maximum likelihood with perturbed genotypes but  for more than 50% of cases  the two methods resulted in individuals being assigned to different families. Treating genotypes as quantitative values allows the same analysis framework to be used for pooled samples of DNA from multiple individuals. Resulting correlations between allele frequency estimates from pooled DNA and individual samples were consistently greater than 0.90  and as high as 0.97 for some pools. Estimates of family contributions to the pools based on quantitative genotypes in pooled DNA had a correlation of 0.85 with estimates of contributions from DNA-derived pedigree. Even with low numbers of SNPs of variable quality  parentage testing and family assignment from pooled samples are sufficiently accurate to provide useful information for a breeding program. Treating genotypes as quantitative values is an alternative to perturbing genotypes using an assumed error distribution  but can produce very different results. An understanding of the distribution of the error is required for SNP genotyping platforms. High-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) assays have become a standard tool in the study of human  animal and plant genetics  due to a rapid increase in SNP density for a constant or falling price per assay. Concurrently  progress has been achieved in technologies for low-density SNP assays with a substantially reduced price per assay. These developments in two directions i.e. maximum density per unit of cost and minimum cost per assay  have provided tools at different price points that are suited to different applications across a broad range of genetics studies. While much of the focus in the literature is on discoveries that arise from the application of the newest  most powerful high-density assays  in many applications  especially in species other than humans  reducing the price per assay is more important than increasing the number of SNPs in the assay. Parentage assignment in commercial livestock industries is an example. The benefit of knowing pedigree is real and quantifiable  but is relatively small per individual animal  and the cost of alternative means of assigning parentage puts a cap on the price at which genomic assays will be beneficial. In commercial aquaculture there are often no alternative means of assigning parentage unless families are reared in isolation  which is undesirable from the perspective of tank infrastructure. Consequently  there is much interest in the use of genomic assays for pedigree construction. In aquaculture  the value of individual animals is perceived to be lower than in many terrestrial livestock species  so systems to assign parentage may be even more sensitive to the price of assays. However  the opportunities are significant. DNA-based parentage removes the need for single-family rearing  allows physical tagging at a much later age  and offers the opportunity to link phenotypes from individuals grown in commercial ponds to broodstock grown in specialized pond or tank systems []. In cases where recording pedigree through management from mating to tagging is impractical  the introduction of molecular-based parentage offers perhaps the only opportunity to embark on a modern genetic improvement program. Importantly  this does not necessarily require the use of high-density genotyping arrays. The shrimp industry is an example of an industry for which to date no high-density SNP assays have been developed  despite ongoing efforts. Establishment of Penaeid shrimp selective breeding programs over the last 20 years have underpinned global expansion of a sustainable shrimp aquaculture industry that is worth an estimated US 3 billion dollars in 2012 (MRP Briggs  personal communication). More recently  breeding programs have adopted microsatellite-based DNA testing to enable accurate pedigree assignment  both to select for specific genetic traits that maximise production efficiency and to restrict inbreeding []–[]. When applying molecular tools to parentage testing  statistical methods developed in other disciplines have usually been used. For example  in the analysis of SNP data from a designed Black Tiger shrimp  breeding program  Sellars [] applied maximum likelihood methods that were developed for parentage assignment using microsatellites in wild populations. Both the change from microsatellites to SNPs and differences between wild populations and managed breeding populations provide justification for reviewing the appropriateness of these existing methods for parentage assignment. Microsatellites have been empirically compared to SNPs for parentage analysis in a number of studies e.g. []–[] and parentage assignment using SNPs is discussed in other studies  e.g. []–[]. Earlier studies favoured microsatellites  especially for non-model organisms  due to the ease of developing microsatellites and the additional power that results from the larger numbers of alleles at each locus. However  the price per SNP in a high-density array is so much less than the price of an equivalent amount of information from microsatellites that more recent studies accept that SNPs can be more efficient in some circumstances. If SNPs are sufficiently closely linked  haplotypes of SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium can be estimated  and these are far more polymorphic than individual SNPs and can be treated as alleles in parentage analyses [] []. In these situations  the differences in polymorphism between SNPs and microsatellites become negligible. To date  comparisons of microsatellites and SNPs for parentage analysis have generally used the same methods and software for each assay platform  with little consideration of the properties of the method. Over the years  a number of statistical approaches to parentage analysis have been considered (see Jones [] for a review). The aim of the current study is the quantitative analysis of genotypes from low-cost  low-density SNP assays  focusing on maximum likelihood based methods that allow for the possibility of genotyping errors  e.g. []–[]. The likely form of genotyping errors in bi-allelic SNP data was explicitly discussed by Sieberts []  Anderson and Garza [] and Teo []. With only two alleles at each locus  a genotyping error is easily modelled as the probability of an allele being read as the alternative allele  and this probability can be assumed to be constant across SNPs and samples  or specific to SNPs or samples  e.g. []. A second reason for focusing on maximum likelihood methods is that the likelihoods of alternative pedigrees can serve as input into a second analysis  in which other  non genetic data is included [] []. For example  the probability of a particular mating having occurred can be affected by spatial location records  both in wild and in managed populations. In all studies mentioned above  assay results from microsatellites or SNPs were modelled as discrete pairs of alleles. However  in their raw form  SNP assays return quantitative estimates of area or intensity for two axes  X and Y  which relate to the two nucleotide alleles. For example  the Illumina BEADSTUDIO software can be configured to return the frequency of the B allele  a quantitative measure taking values between 0 and 1 []. Commonly  these quantitative values are used to estimate SNP allele frequencies in pooled samples of DNA  which can then be used to estimate SNP effects on disease or production traits  e.g. [] []–[]  but they can also be used to estimate population parameters  such as the proportional contributions from multiple families in a pooled sample []. This application is of particular interest for selective breeding in aquaculture  where individual animals are of low value  but family numbers are very large. In shrimp  genotyping assays of pooled DNA samples provide promise for linking substantial amounts of quantitative phenotypic data from commercial ponds to parental broodstock. High-performing families can be identified and young broodstock from these families can then be used to produce the next generation. In this study  we attempted to incorporate all of the seemingly disparate aspects of SNPs and parentage analysis noted above into a single approach. We used a low-density SNP panel to genotype individuals and pools from several generations from a domesticated  breeding population. Instead of applying an error function to discrete allele calls  we estimated genotype probabilities directly from the quantitative X-Y data from the assay  using SNP specific parameters that were calibrated from as many samples as are available. These genotype probabilities were then used in maximum likelihood parentage analysis  using a matrix formulation to simplify the algebra and reduce the risk of software errors. We also describe the matrix formulation of a traditional maximum likelihood method [] and of simply counting allele mismatches and  for comparison  applied them to the same dataset. The likelihoods from the parentage analysis were used to identify likely family structures that are consistent with known biological constraints in . Finally  we used the most likely parent pairs identified in this analysis to estimate family contributions in pooled samples of DNA from the progeny. A worked example of the statistical approach used in this study is in the Appendix. Samples were available from multiple generations of  shrimp from a single hatchery. All available pleopod tips (approximately 8 mm in size) from G9 (generation 9  n = 311) breeding shrimp and a random sample of 202 G10 shrimp from the same shrimp breeding line were used. Pleopod tips were snap-frozen on dry ice for transport back to the laboratory. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from each individual using CSIRO standard industry protocols that apply QIAGEN’s DNeasy extraction methodology. gDNA was also extracted from 583 G1 and G2 individuals from an unrelated breeding line from the same farm. In addition to the individual samples  the 202 G10 shrimp were allocated at random to nine pools  each containing between 18 and 24 individuals  and the 311 G9 shrimp were allocated at random to 13 pools  each containing between 23 and 26 individuals. Pooled gDNA samples were then created by mixing 5 µL of gDNA from each individual in the pool. Subsequently  60 µL from each pooled samples and 500 ng of gDNA from each individual shrimp were sent to GeneWorks® for genotyping using the 63-SNP marker Sequenom® iPLEX Platinum panel reported by Sellars   []. Of these 63 SNPs  two consistently failed and were removed from all analyses  leaving a 61-SNP assay. All 1096 G1  G2  G9 and G10 individual samples (i.e.  excluding the samples of pooled DNA) were used to estimate SNP specific parameters. In addition to the standard genotype call for each SNP for each sample  GeneWorks® provided estimates of the X and Y areas that relate to the A and B alleles for each SNP  which are the raw output from the Sequenom genotyping platform. For assay   for sample  and SNP   these consist of an area for each allele ( and ) and an uncertainty measure for each allele ( and ). We excluded assay results when the Sequenom software failed to call an allele. For all other assays  we converted Cartesian X-Y area measurements to polar coordinates [] to derive a measure of allelic proportion as: This can be interpreted as a measure taking a value between 0.0 and 1.0  corresponding to the polar coordinate range from 0 to . A figure showing the relationship between the X and Y areas and  is in the Appendix. We then used the genotype calls from the Sequenom software to estimate means (   and ) and standard deviations (   and ) for values  for each genotype class (homozygous AA  heterozygous AB  and homozygous BB) for each SNP. Unlike in the approach used to estimate B allele frequencies in []  where allelic proportions were scaled such that values  = 0.0  0.5 and 1.0 corresponded to the means    and   respectively  we did not scale the  values. As a measure of the power to discriminate between genotype classes  we used the Welch statistic (the t-statistic appropriate when the variances of classes are unequal  using the standard output for the t.test() function in R []). The Welch statistics t and t were estimated for the intervals ( to ) and ( to )  respectively. Parents from generation G9 were assigned to the G10 individuals in a two-step process. First  the likelihoods of sire-dam-offspring trios were estimated. Instead of first assigning genotypes and then applying a likelihood method that incorporated an error term (such as in [] [] [])  the likelihood method explicitly incorporated the SNP specific parameters (         and ) and the measures of allelic proportion . The latter were included regardless of whether the Sequenom software called a genotype  but were set to missing when  -  +  -  was less than 3.0. This cut-off was chosen after examining the values of  and  for those samples that were not assigned a genotype by the Sequenom software. For each   a quantitative ordered genotype probability matrix  was estimated as: where F is the height of the N(  s) distribution at <U+2009>=<U+2009>  F and F are each half the height of the N(  ) distribution at <U+2009>=<U+2009>  F is the height of the N(  ) distribution at <U+2009>=<U+2009>  and the sum SF is over genotypes AA  AB  BA and BB. The  matrices are symmetric  and have dimension (2 × 2) for biallelic SNPs. The vector of probabilities of allele transmission from a sire or dam  at marker  is Multiplying by the vector of 1s produces the row averages  and the column averages   which are equal because  is symmetric. So here the equation for  could be simplified  but there are situations where  might not be symmetric (for example  in a multigenerational dataset where parental origin of alleles is known)  so we chose to leave the equation in this more general format. For a potential parent pair  sire (s) and dam (d)  with transmission vectors  and   the transmission matrix  contains the genotype probabilities expected from that pairing. Thus  for offspring (o) with genotype probability matrix   the likelihood of the trio () for marker  is: where  is the Hadamard or entrywise product. To estimate the likelihood when marker data for one parent is missing  the genotype matrix for the missing parent was set to   where  is the (2 × 1) vector of allele frequencies for SNP   estimated from all G9 animals. In the likelihood ratio   the denominator  is the likelihood under the null hypothesis that the offspring is unrelated to the sire and dam  which is constructed by treating both parents as missing. The likelihood ratio across all markers is the product of the marker likelihood ratios  or the sum of the log-likelihood ratios. For consistency with earlier publications  we will refer to the summed log-likelihood as the log odds (LOD) score. We only retained LOD scores where  for at least 10 SNPs  none of the sire  dam or offspring genotypes were missing. This relatively relaxed threshold was used because the LOD scores were further processed in the second step  as described in a following paragraph. When the LOD for a sire-dam-offspring trio was less than the LOD for the sire-offspring pair with a missing dam  the sire-offspring LOD was used and the dam was assumed to be missing. Likewise  when the LOD for a sire-dam-offspring trio was less than the LOD for the dam-offspring pair with a missing sire  the dam-offspring LOD was used and the sire was assumed to be missing. The most likely pedigree was identified and will be referred to as the unrestricted pedigree. The second step in the parentage assignment was to impose constraints due to the reproductive biology of  and hatchery records. The G10 offspring were produced by natural mating of the G9 parents in large mating groups  spawned over a three-week period. Under natural mating  females can only mate immediately following moult  which occurs in a cycle of approximately three weeks  and at each moult  females mate with at most one male. Given the width of the spawning window  it is unlikely  but not impossible  that females produced offspring from more than one male. After mating  male  take 7 to 12 days to re-develop their spermatophores [] []. So similarly  it is unlikely  but not impossible  that males produced offspring from more than one female. Accordingly  we used a stochastic search process to identify two constrained pedigrees  first the set of full-sib families that maximised the total LOD (referred to as the full-sib pedigree) and second  the set of half-sib families that maximised the total LOD (referred to as the half-sib pedigree)  where for the half-sib families  parents could have no more than two mates. For each full-sib and half-sib pedigree  5000 independent random pedigrees were sampled and the one with the maximum total LOD retained. Each random pedigree was produced by proceeding through randomly ordered offspring  creating a family for the sire-dam-offspring mating pair with the highest LOD that did not violate mating constraints. With this approach  the largest families are likely to be identified first  maximising the chance of finding a high likelihood solution for the whole pedigree. We validated the method by repeating the process five times  and in each case the same solution was found  always within the first 1000 of the 5000 samples. To assist in determining whether departures from the hypothesized full-sib pedigree structure were due to lack of power in parentage assignment or to parents having multiple mates  we fitted two generalised linear models  with the response vector for the first model coded 0/1 when the parent pair was different/the same in the unrestricted and half-sib pedigrees  and with the response vector for the second model coded 0/1 when the parent pair was different/the same in the half-sib and full-sib pedigrees. For each offspring  the explanatory variable was the sum of the genotype probabilities for the most likely unordered genotype for each SNP. For comparison  we also conducted the analysis described above using an established maximum likelihood approach [] [] [] and by exclusion. Both of these are easily represented in matrix form. For the maximum likelihood approach  the genotype probability matrix is built as   where the discrete genotype matrix   the genotype probability matrix expected due to the allele frequency is   as described above  and e is the assumed error rate. Alternative formulations of the matrix for heterozygous individuals are equivalent  provided that the sum of the heterozygous probabilities equals 1  while the assumed error rates may be constant or differ between SNPs. We estimated SNP specific error rates in two different ways. First  as   where  is the vector for SNP  that comprised the maximums of the unordered genotypes in  (with the unordered heterozygous genotype being the sum of the two ordered heterozygous genotypes); and second  as: This second formulation allows for an underlying error rate regardless of the precision of the genotyping assay  which is similar to allowing a certain number of mismatches when using an exclusion method. We refer to  and  as the estimated and assumed error rates  respectively. To assign parentage  the genotype probability matrix  replaces the genotype probability matrix  in Equation   while no changes to Equation  are required. We refer to this maximum likelihood method as “perturbed”  since the  matrices are perturbed with an assumed error function. In forming the  matrices  we included only markers for which the most likely genotype in the quantitative ordered genotype probability matrix  was greater than 0.98 (or 0.49 for the two heterozygous genotypes). Counting mismatches for the exclusion method using the matrix formulation is equally straightforward. Matrix  is used instead of  to produce the transition matrices in Equation  and  similar to the likelihood calculation in Equation   the number of mismatches is the number of markers for which  equals 0. In assigning parents  we either allowed for no or three mismatches. Three mismatches out of 61 SNPs is small relative to the 15 out of 122 SNPs allowed by []  but SNPs have only two alleles  so mismatches between unrelated individuals are expected to occur by chance far less frequently with SNPs than with microsatellites. For each SNP (subscripted )  for each of the nine pools (subscript ) we assumed that the reaction had failed for assays for which <U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>3. For the remaining assays  allelic proportions  were estimated for each pooled sample using Equation . As in Peiffer . []  the genotype means (   and ) estimated from individual samples were used to adjust the allelic proportions to obtain estimates of allele frequencies   where As an estimate of the variation associated with   we used the relevant Welch statistic (t or t): Allele frequencies of pooled samples    were also estimated from the genotype probability matrices of the individuals that were used to create each pool. This was done using the estimated allelic proportions for the individuals. The correlation between  and  was estimated for each pool  and the effect of genotyping success rates on the correlation was tested using a regression analysis. The families represented in the nine G10 pools were determined using the known G10 individuals in the pool and the full-sib  half-sib and unrestricted pedigrees were identified using the stochastic search described above. With  being the number of SNPs for each pool   containing individuals from  families  matrices  (subscript  implied)    and  were assembled as follows: where  contains estimates of the allele frequencies for SNP  and family   given the estimated genotype probability matrices for the sire and dam described above. Missing values in  and  were replaced with 0.5  and missing values in  were replaced with 1.0. These  and  matrices are equivalent to those of Kinghorn []  except that we add a vector of weights . These weights are based on the differences in resolution between genotype clusters for individual samples  which we assume is related to the variance of allele frequency estimates for pooled samples. We then used the pcls() function in the R package mgcv [] [] to solve the weighted least squares problem  for the ( × 1) vector of family contributions   subject to the constraint ()<U+2009>><U+2009>0. Strictly  an additional constraint <U+2211><U+2009><U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0 applies  but we found that the sum of the solution vector * returned by pcls() was generally close to 1.0 (min = 1.02  max = 1.12)  and we scaled *  to produce a final estimated family contribution vector . For each pool  we also constructed vectors  using the means of allele frequencies for individual samples in the pool (i.e.  using  instead of ) and we estimated family contributions from these for comparison. Of the 64 538 assays (1058 G1  G2  G9  and G10 animals by 61 SNPs)  an estimated genotype was returned by the Sequenom software for 54 761 assays. There was a lot of variation in genotype call rates between SNPs. The reasons for this become evident when the raw data are examined. In Figure   intensity is plotted against allelic proportion () for selected SNPs  based on X-Y areas unadjusted for area uncertainty on the left  and based on X-Y areas adjusted for area uncertainty on the right. For the adjusted plots  the means (   and ) and standard deviations (   and ) from values  in each genotype class (AA  AB  and BB) are also provided. The first SNP (78443-0_3537) illustrates the value in subtracting the uncertainty value; although there was little change in the values of  for heterozygous individuals  the variation in the values of  for homozygous individuals was much reduced. The second SNP (550057-0_189) illustrates that the variation in heterozygous individuals could be much higher than that in homozygous individuals  and that the mean  for heterozygous individuals may not lie half way between the means for the homozygous individuals. For this SNP  most assays produced a genotype estimate. The third SNP (484475-0_438) exhibits even more variation  and the mean value of  for homozygous GG individuals was not close to 1.0. For this SNP  a genotype was not returned for some assays when  values did not clearly lie within the clusters. For the final SNP (753848-0_614)  the within-genotype variation was smaller and clusters were quite distinct  with few uncalled genotypes  but the mean values of  were very different from 0.0  0.5  and 1.0. The Welch statistics (t  t) for these four SNPs were (224.24  155.44)  (132.96  46.95)  (48.17  35.44) and (58.97  67.92)  respectively. For the second SNP  there was a large difference between t  and t  with a clearer distinction between the means of the AA and AG genotypes than between the AG and GG genotypes.  Intensity is plotted against allelic proportion  (see Equation ) for all individuals for four selected SNPs  using both the unadjusted areas (left hand side) and areas adjusted for the uncertainty associated with the area estimate as provided by the genotyping provider (right hand side); intensities are estimated as Euclidean distances from the origin to the data points in Cartesian coordinates; for the adjusted areas  the mean and standard deviation of the allelic proportion estimates () are provided. For three of the 61 SNPs  the number of genotype calls was not sufficient to estimate the SNP parameters  and  for the remaining 58 SNPs  quantitative genotype probability matrices (quantitative genotypes) could be estimated only for 43% of individuals. The estimated error rates  of 47 SNPs were lower than 0.01  and the assumed error rates  for these were set to 0.01. For the remaining SNPs  seven had estimated error rates lower than 0.02  three had estimated error rates lower than 0.04  and one had an estimated error rate of 0.08. For 87% of individuals  quantitative genotypes could be estimated on 50 or more SNPs  but for 10% of individuals  less than 20 SNPs provided quantitative genotypes. When quantitative genotypes could be estimated  in 95.4% of cases the most likely unordered genotype class had a genotype probability that exceeded 0.98  our threshold for declaring a genotype for use in the perturbed maximum likelihood and exclusion methods. In Figure   quantitative genotype probabilities are compared to perturbed genotype probabilities. Generally  the quantitative genotype probability was far more certain (i.e.  closer to 0 or 1) than the perturbed genotype probability. The patterns for estimated error and assumed error were remarkably similar; the effect of imposing a floor of 1% in the assumed error was reduced by multiplication by the expected genotype frequency given the allele frequencies. Consequently  although the assumed error rate was greater than or equal to 0.01  genotype probabilities were still commonly less than 0.01 or greater than 0.99. The patterns in panels A and D were affected by the threshold of 98% quantitative genotype certainty before a perturbed genotype was assigned  but a perturbed genotype was missing for that reason in only 3414 out of 72 039 cases.  Perturbed genotype probabilities were estimated using either an estimated error (top three panels) or an assumed error (bottom three panels)  and were only estimated when the quantitative genotype probability exceeded 0.98; the data in the left hand panels   are expanded in the centre   and right hand panels  . G9 males (166) and females (124) recorded as potential parents of the G10 offspring were tested as parents of G10 progeny (210). Using the quantitative genotypes  of the 34 860 sire-offspring pairs  a LOD score was produced for only 28 566 pairs  the others having less than 10 SNPs for which both sire and offspring had an estimated allelic proportion. For dam-offspring pairs  19 872 LOD scores were produced from a possible 26 040 pairs. Testing each sire by dam combination for the 207 offspring resulted in LOD scores for 2 741 922 sire-dam-offspring trios for which at least 10 SNPs in all three animals had a valid genotype. In Figure   LOD scores from quantitative and perturbed maximum likelihood are compared using the estimated error  and using the assumed error  for the perturbed maximum likelihood. The LOD scores that were estimated using the quantitative approach have the greatest range  followed by those estimated using the perturbed approach with an estimated error  followed by those estimated using the perturbed approach with an assumed error.  In the top two panels  the genotypes were perturbed (x-axis) using the estimated error rate  and in the bottom two panels  the genotypes were perturbed (x-axis) using the assumed error rate; the left hand panels contain LOD scores for all pedigrees  while in the right hand panels only LOD scores for the 10 most likely pedigrees for each progeny are plotted; these are coloured according to whether the pedigree appeared in the top 10 pedigrees obtained using perturbed genotypes  the top 10 pedigrees obtained using quantitative genotypes  or the top 10 pedigrees for both approaches. Differences in the distributions of LOD scores produced differences in the distribution of most likely pedigrees. Table  summarises  for each progeny  whether both parents appear to have genotype records included in the analysis  whether one parent appears to be missing  or whether both parents appear to be missing. Results differed largely between methods; exclusion allowing zero mismatches produced the least assignments and exclusion allowing three mismatches produced the most assignments. The three maximum likelihood methods were intermediate  with the quantitative method most similar to exclusion allowing zero mismatches  and the perturbed method with an assumed error most similar to exclusion allowing three mismatches. To understand the reasons for these differences  we examined individual cases when the perturbed method produced a high likelihood for a trio and the quantitative method did not. The differences were due to a small number of SNPs  which when perturbed moved genotype probabilities away from 0 or 1  while the quantitative estimates were very close to 0 or 1. In one example (progeny 2443  sire 1819  dam 1728)  for SNP 78443-0_3537 (the first SNP in Figure   with error rates )  the probabilities of the progeny genotype not being AA were < 1.0e-28  0.0009 and 0.0091 for the quantitative and perturbation () approaches respectively  and the probabilities of the sire genotype not being GG were <1.0e-14  0.0005 and 0.0050. The effect of this SNP on the log likelihood was -31.9 for the quantitative genotype  -5.1 for the perturbed genotype () and -2.9 for the perturbed genotype () approaches. The penalty for an inconsistent genotype can be much larger for the quantitative approach  since the genotype probabilities can be much closer to 0 or 1. In Figure   for each progeny  the LOD scores for the most likely pedigree is compared to d  the difference in LOD between the most likely and second most likely pedigrees. For arbitrary thresholds of maximum LOD greater than 3.0 and d greater than 3.0  assignment rates for the quantitative maximum likelihood and perturbed maximum likelihood () approaches were similar at 23  22 and 20% respectively. However  the families assigned under the approaches frequently differed; for only 9% of progeny did the quantitative and perturbed approaches most exceed the thresholds for the same parent pair  regardless of whether the estimated or assumed error rate was used for the perturbed approach.  For each progeny  the LOD score of the most likely sire-dam family (x-axis) and d  the difference between the LOD for the most likely and second most likely sire dam family (y-axis)  are plotted; colours indicate whether quantitative or perturbed (estimated error or assumed error) genotypes were used. The remaining results relate to the quantitative genotypes and likelihoods. Summaries of the impact of the pedigree constraints are in Table . The three largest families were the same for all three analyses  each comprising a known sire and unknown dam. In Figure   the LOD scores for unrestricted pedigrees are compared to LOD scores for full-sib and half-sib pedigrees. Most of the increase in LOD score observed when going from full-sib families to half-sib families occurred due to a small number of individuals  each with a large LOD score  leaving a full-sib family to form their own half-sib family. The quality of the individual genotype  measured as the sum of the genotype probabilities for the most likely unordered genotype for each SNP  had no effect on whether individuals were assigned to the same or different parents in the half-sib and unrestricted pedigrees (P > 0.3)  but there was a suggestion that it had an effect on whether individuals were assigned to the same or different parents in the full-sib and half-sib pedigrees (P = 0.08  residual deviance 133.17 on 205 degrees of freedom).  The maximum sire-dam-offspring trio LOD score is plotted for each of the 207 G10 progeny; on the y-axis  the maximum LOD score for the unrestricted pedigree is plotted  while on the x-axis the maximum LOD scores for the half-sib and full-sib pedigrees are plotted; the order of plotting is full-sibs followed by half-sibs; full-sib data points are masked by half-sib data points  except when the two differ. Genotyping of three of the 22 pools failed and only results for the other 19 pools are presented  in Table  and graphically in Figure . The proportion of genotypes available for individuals known to be in pools differed between pools  with a higher average proportion of individual shrimp genotypes available for pools with G10 individuals. The G9 and G10 samples were taken a year apart  and DNA was extracted soon after collection  so there was a batch effect of unknown cause. Not surprisingly  differences in the proportion of genotypes available for individuals known to be in the pools had a significant effect on the correlation between  and  * (P = 0.034). Generation (G9 or G10) only affected the correlation through its effect on the proportion of genotypes available on individuals; if this proportion was in the model then the generation effect on the correlation was not significant. There was also variation in the number of SNP genotypes available per pool  and this also had an effect on the correlation (P = 0.002). This suggests that for assays with fewer SNPs called  results for other SNPs were also more variable. The estimate of the Welch statistic (Figure   panel B) had a highly significant effect on the correspondence between  and  * (P < 1e-7); the difference between  and  * tended to be smaller for estimates with high Welch statistics (i.e. those in intervals where genotype clusters for samples from individual DNA were clearly distinguished).  SNP allele frequencies estimated from pooled or individual samples are compared in panel   and  in panel   the absolute value of the difference between allele frequency estimates from pooled and individual samples is plotted as a function of the estimate of the relevant Welch statistic (t). For the eight G10 pools  family contributions estimated from pedigree ranged from 4 to 35% (1/24 to 8/23). The most abundant family generally accounted for between one quarter and one third of the individuals in a pool (Table ). The correlation between the contributions estimated from pedigree and from the pooled DNA samples (i.e. using ) differed based on the pedigree used (Figure   left hand panels)  with the highest correlation (0.85) for the full-sib pedigree and the lowest correlation (0.54) for the unrestricted pedigree. Contributions of the larger families were over-estimated with the pooled DNA samples and contributions of the smaller families were under-estimated. If family contributions were estimated from the mean value of  for individuals in the pool (i.e. using   *) instead of from pooled DNA samples  correlations with pedigree-based estimates were 0.87  0.65 and 0.60 for the full-sib  half-sib and unrestricted pedigrees  respectively. These correlations did not differ greatly from the correlations obtained from pooled DNA samples  which may be explained by the high correlation between contributions estimated from pooled and from individual samples (Figure   right hand panels).  Estimates of family contributions to pools from pooled DNA samples (y-axis) are compared to family contributions to pools estimated from pedigree (x-axis  left hand panels) and to family contributions estimated from individual DNA samples (x-axis  right hand panels). This study focussed on the inference of relationships between individuals using genotype data obtained from a low-cost low-density genotyping platform. We used an example from aquaculture but the results are also relevant to other industries for which the value of an individual animal is low. We chose to restrict our genotype data to that obtainable from a single low-density Sequenom 63-SNP multiplexed assay  the cost of which is similar to that of genotyping a very small number of multiplexed microsatellites (e.g. two panels of six and seven microsatellites  as used by Sellars []). Rather than increase power and cost by using multiple Sequenom assays to genotype additional SNPs  we used statistical approaches to extract more information from the data available from an existing single SNP assay. Notably  quantitative genotype estimates were used in data processing  rather than genotypes that had been classified into discrete genotype classes. This also meant that extension to analysis of DNA from groups of individuals was straightforward. The differences in the pattern of area measurements between SNPs (Figure ) provide immediate justification for treating SNP genotypes as quantitative values. With the assay used in this study  it is clear that there is often considerable variability amongst X-Y signals within a genotype cluster  while other clusters form very tight groups. We chose to use a normal distribution to model the distribution of area measurements  for consistency with algorithms used to call alleles  but another distribution is clearly more appropriate for some alleles and some SNPs. We recognise that the benefits of quantitative genotypes may be less for other  more accurate genotyping platforms  or for Sequenom panels with more rigorous SNP screening. The panel used here  although of modest power  was very affordable in terms of both development and application. However  we do believe that investment in better SNP screening is often justified. As with the use of statistical approaches to increase power  and in contrast to using multiple panels to increase power  once development costs have been accounted for  an up-front investment in SNP screening produces no ongoing additional cost per sample. We tried to keep our approach to parentage assignment as clear as possible. The Mendelian transmission rules are simple and constant for diploid species  and are easily represented by matrix operations  regardless of whether genotypes are discrete or continuous. The error function we used for our quantitative approach assumed that area estimates produced by the genotyping platform have a normal distribution. Alternative maximum likelihood approaches make different assumptions about the distribution of the error  but the matrix algebra is the same. One characteristic of our error distribution is that  unlike (for example) Marshall []  we did not allow for additional errors associated with the possibility of sample swaps. Because the Sequenom assay is applied to all SNPs in parallel  all SNP genotypes come from the same DNA sample. Thus  a sample swap will either be identified due to inconsistencies with the known pedigree  or if it goes unnoticed  its impact will be equivalent to a tagging error. We observed large differences between results for the quantitative approach and the perturbed error approach in our study  which highlights the importance of the error term in the maximum likelihood procedure. For some SNPs and some individuals  the quantitative approach sets the error term to a very low value  essentially zero  and therefore applies a strict exclusion criterion for these SNPs. For other SNPs and individuals  a more lenient error term is applied. Whether this is better or worse than SNP specific error rates  or the arbitrary error rate of 1% used for comparison with perturbation  depends on how well the alternatives match the true but unknown error distribution. For a SNP genotyping technology for which the probability of the relevant homozygous genotype is effectively equal to 0 whenever the signal for either X or Y is effectively 0  the quantitative method is preferred. If there is a probability that at random one of the X or Y signals totally drops out for a heterozygous individual  while the other signal remains strong  then the perturbed method is preferred. There is nothing in our dataset to help us to choose between these two alternatives. The assignment rates for the two approaches were both unacceptably low at around 20%  due either to a lack of power in the panel or missing genotypes on parents. However  because the families assigned using one error distribution had only a small overlap with the families assigned using other error distributions  it is clearly very important that we learn all we can about the true distribution of errors. Based on Figure   it is apparent that  the application of constraints to the pedigree in the second stage of parent assignment to account for biological constraints and hatchery records affected only a relatively small number of individuals. In the unconstrained pedigree  most offspring were assigned to full-sib families  which is consistent with our understanding of the data. For the constrained pedigrees  without access to a more powerful DNA parentage panel  it is not possible to determine whether departures from a full-sib model are due to parents having multiple mates  or to incorrect assignments. The weak association between the quality of the individual’s genotype data and consistency of assignment between full-sib and half-sib families suggests that the departures from a full-sib model may be at least partly due to incorrect assignments caused by poor quality genotype data. A weakness of this study is the lack of knowledge on the true parentage of the G10 progeny  especially for families for which a parent was declared as missing. We do not know whether the true parent was not tested  or whether the true parent was tested but genotyping failed (which occurred in around 10% of cases)  or whether the true parent was tested and wrongly excluded. However  for industrial application in the  breeding program  although not desirable  this incomplete information is not an insurmountable problem. Individuals in such families  while missing one parent  are known to be full-sibs  and the potential mates of the identified parent are likely known and from a common genetic background. Thus  it is unlikely that breeding decisions would differ in a significant way if the missing information was available. Correlations between allele frequencies estimated from individual and from pooled samples were consistently greater than 0.9. Not surprisingly  given the variability between SNPs (Figure )  there was a strong association between the Welch statistics (t or t) related to the interval that contained the allele frequency estimate () from pooled DNA  and the absolute value of the difference between the allele frequency estimate from pooled DNA and from individual DNA (Figure   panel B). This suggests that for low-density SNP assays  variation in SNP quality is as important as other forms of variation when analysing samples from pooled DNA. The high correlations between allele frequency estimates from pooled and individual samples were reflected in the high correlations between estimates of family contributions to pools when using allele frequencies from the two sources (Figure   right hand panels). The correlations between family contributions to pools estimated from pedigree and from allele frequencies were not as high (Figure   left hand panels). This indicates that 50 SNPs is too few to produce accurate estimates of contributions for pools containing individuals from around 12 families. However  especially in the case of the full-sib pedigree  the correlations were positive  and probably high enough to provide useful information. Despite this  because much fewer assays are needed when DNA samples are pooled  it will be cost effective to use multiple low-density SNP assays such as the four  multiplexed assays already available [] or high-density SNP assays when they become available. Treating SNP genotypes as continuous instead of as discrete values in parentage assignment poses no additional statistical problems. The maximum likelihood framework seamlessly incorporates quantitative allele probabilities; they only require an alternative formulation for the distribution of the error term. However  since the distribution of the error term can have a large impact on pedigree assignments  it is important to gain an understanding of this distribution. The likelihood equations can be conveniently formulated using matrix algebra  allowing easy implementation on any software platform that supports matrix operations. Using the Sequenom assay with only 63 SNPs  most individuals were assigned to full-sib families  as expected given the origin of the samples. Further refinement of the pedigree by constraining parents to only one mate reduced the number of families from 64 to 43  and probably results in a more accurate pedigree given the uncertainty in the parentage assignments from a low-density SNP panel. Estimates of family contributions in pooled samples of DNA obtained with 63 SNPs were of low accuracy  and for this application the use of multiple multiplexed low-density SNP assays would be beneficial.                                                                   Additional file : Figure S1 illustrates the mapping from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates for SNP 186827-0_535. In this example  the X and Y areas that relate to SNP alleles A and G  are adjusted for the area uncertainties. The plots highlight the data points for the sire  dam and offspring used throughout this Appendix to illustrate the method. Adjusted X and Y values are (36.6  13.4)  (25.3  22.9) and (30.4  0) for the sire  dam and offspring  respectively. SNP specific parameters for SNP 186827-0_535 are in Additional file : Table S1. For the sire  the estimate of allelic proportion is Similarly  values for the dam and offspring are equal to 0.468 and 0.000  respectively.                                  For this SNP  the alleles are A and G  and for the sire: where () is the height of the normal ( <U+2009>) distribution at . Scaling to make the sum equal to 0 gives the genotype probability matrix for the sire: It is most likely that the sire is heterozygous AG but there is a small probability that it is homozygous AA. Likewise   and  are respectively. The transmission vector for the sire is: and the transmission vector for the dam is  so the transmission matrix for the sire dam pairing is: The likelihood of the trio () for marker  is: The likelihood  is the likelihood under the null hypothesis that the offspring is unrelated to the sire and dam  and is equal to the likelihood for a random parental pair given the allele frequencies. For this SNP  the frequency of the G allele is equal to 0.354  so the transmission vector for a random parent is: and the transmission matrix for a random sire dam pairing is: The likelihood that the offspring comes from a random pair of parents is: The log of the likelihood ratio is . The likelihood for a random pair of parents is greater than the likelihood of the sire dam pair for this offspring for this SNP  so the log of the likelihood ratio is less than 0.                                  At this same SNP ()  for a pool () with allelic proportion <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.289  because <U+2009>< <U+2009><<U+2009>  and the Welch statistic associated with  is equal to 48.170.

"Prioritizing animals for dense genotyping in order to impute missing genotypes of sparsely genotyped animals"	"Authors: Xijiang Yu  John A Woolliams and Theo HE Meuwissen"	"Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences  Norwegian University of Life Sciences  PO Box 5003  Ås  1432  NorwayXijiang Yu & Theo HE Meuwissen The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies  University of Edinburgh  Easter Bush  Midlothian  EH25 9RG  UKJohn A Woolliams"	"No Co-Author"	"26 August 2014"	"BackgroundGenotyping accounts for a substantial part of the cost of genomic selection (GS). Using both dense and sparse SNP chips  together with imputation of missing genotypes  can reduce these costs. The aim of this study was to identify the set of candidates that are most important for dense genotyping  when they are used to impute the genotypes of sparsely genotyped animals. In a real pig pedigree  the 2500 most recently born pigs of the last generation  i.e. the target animals  were used for sparse genotyping. Their missing genotypes were imputed using either Beagle or LDMIP from  densely genotyped candidates chosen from the whole pedigree. A new optimization method was derived to identify the best animals for dense genotyping  which minimized the conditional genetic variance of the target animals  using either the pedigree-based relationship matrix (MCA)  or a genotypic relationship matrix based on sparse marker genotypes (MCG). These  and five other methods for selecting the  animals were compared  using <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 or 200 animals  SNP genotypes were obtained assuming  =100 or 200  and MAF thresholds set to <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01  0.05 or 0.10.

Using both dense and sparse SNP chips  together with imputation of missing genotypes  can reduce these costs. The aim of this study was to identify the set of candidates that are most important for dense genotyping  when they are used to impute the genotypes of sparsely genotyped animals. In a real pig pedigree  the 2500 most recently born pigs of the last generation  i.e. the target animals  were used for sparse genotyping. Their missing genotypes were imputed using either Beagle or LDMIP from  densely genotyped candidates chosen from the whole pedigree. A new optimization method was derived to identify the best animals for dense genotyping  which minimized the conditional genetic variance of the target animals  using either the pedigree-based relationship matrix (MCA)  or a genotypic relationship matrix based on sparse marker genotypes (MCG). These  and five other methods for selecting the  animals were compared  using <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 or 200 animals  SNP genotypes were obtained assuming  =100 or 200  and MAF thresholds set to <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01  0.05 or 0.10. The performances of the methods were compared using the following criteria: call rate of true genotypes  accuracy of genotype prediction  and accuracy of genomic evaluations using the imputed genotypes. For all criteria  MCA and MCG performed better than other selection methods  significantly so for all methods other than selection of sires with the largest numbers of offspring. Methods that choose animals that have the closest average relationship or contribution to the target population gave the lowest accuracy of imputation  in some cases worse than random selection  and should be avoided in practice. Minimization of the conditional variance of the genotypes in target animals provided an effective optimization procedure for prioritizing animals for genotyping or sequencing. Genomic selection (GS) has been rapidly adopted by the dairy breeding industry after its introduction in 2008. Indeed  at present more than 90% of the bulls of the Holstein  Jersey  and Brown Swiss breeds in North America are genotyped every year[]. To date  35 populations have genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) recognized by Interbull[]. The success of the implementation of GS in dairy breeding has also encouraged the use of genomic evaluation in other livestock and in plants  and the exploration of its value for medical genetics. Meanwhile  it has become clear that the size of the reference population used for training is an important factor for the reliability of genomic breeding values[  ]  which means that more genotyping is required. Therefore  there is a need for the identification of cost-effective methods to increase the size of reference populations  and reduce the cost of genotyping candidates  so that this technology becomes both more accurate and more widely applicable. Genomic selection requires sufficiently dense SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chips to capture sufficient genetic variation to provide useful accuracy in predicting breeding values. However  high-density genotyping of many animals is very costly  and with the fast development of molecular technology  denser chips continue to be developed. For example  the Illumina BovineHD chip[] that became available in 2010 has 777 962 SNPs. Another new step forward is whole-genome sequencing  e.g. the 1000 bull genome project[]. However  the high price of whole-genome sequencing and high-density SNP chips is a barrier for the application of these new technologies to large numbers of animals  especially in species for which individual animals are not as valuable as dairy bulls. One solution proposed by[] was to use a mixture of dense and sparse chips together with genotype imputation  which can markedly reduce costs while maintaining high-density results. The question then arises: which animals should be densely genotyped and which sparsely? The aim of this work was to identify a set of animals in a pedigree which  when densely genotyped  provide the highest imputation accuracy. We derived a theoretical optimal strategy  both with and without genomic information  and compared it to other empirical solutions. The effectiveness of the method was assessed based on (1) the genotype imputation error rates and the correlation between true and predicted genotypes  and (2) a utilitarian measure given by the accuracy of GEBV derived with the imputed genotypes. A Landrace pig pedigree provided by NORSVIN AS [] was used. It consisted of 13 276 pigs  including 619 sires and a total of 12 generations. The 2500 most recently born animals of the last generation  all without offspring in the dataset  were chosen as the target population on which imputation would be judged. Therefore  sets of  pigs were selected from the entire population based on different criteria for dense genotyping (or whole-genome sequencing). Success of imputation was measured in the target population  which was sparsely genotyped. To assess the accuracy of genomic selection in the target population  2000 animals from the target population were randomly chosen as the training set  for which phenotypes and imputed genotypes were both recorded  and the remaining 500 were treated as a validation set. GEBV were estimated and the accuracy of the GEBV was evaluated as the correlation between GEBV and true breeding values. Seven methods were used to select sets of pigs for dense genotyping from the entire pig pedigree  including the target population. It was assumed that the budget necessary for dense genotyping of  individuals was available and that the target animals for testing imputation were all sparsely genotyped at density  was equal to100 or 200 and  was equal to 50  100 or 200 markers per Morgan. The seven methods are described below. Two of the methods described below have optimal properties for the problem based upon minimizing the genetic variance of the target population conditional on the selected set  using either relationships obtained from Wright’s numerator relationship matrix   (MCA)  or a genomic relationship matrix   (MCG) obtained from sparse genotyping. These criteria minimize the mean square error of an unbiased predictor of an imputed genotype from dense genotype information on the selected set. The remaining five methods are either heuristic (KIN  REL  CON  SRS) or random (RAN). For method MCA  it is assumed that the only information available on relationships prior to dense genotyping is from the pedigree. The variance-covariance matrix for the count of a reference allele at any locus for the pedigree is proportional to Wright’s numerator relationship matrix  . The variance-covariance matrix conditional on the selection of a set of animals for dense genotyping (but prior to having obtained any genotypes) is given by  where the bold subscript 1 denotes the set of target animals and bold subscript 2 denotes the set of densely genotyped animals. Thus  for example   represents the sub-matrix of pedigree relationships among the target animals. The conditional variances  diag  are the residual variances that are expected to remain if dense genotypes were to be obtained from the selected set and used to predict the genotypes of the target set. Therefore  it is diag that is to be minimized  and the summary statistic used was . This minimization to select the densely genotyped animals was carried out using an iterative procedure: first  the animal that most reduced  was selected  i.e. animal  that maximized  (/)  where  is the vector of relationships of animal  with the target set of animals   is its transpose  and  is the relationship of animal  with itself. After selecting animal   the entire relationship matrix was made conditional on the genotype of animal   <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>/ where  is the vector of relationships of  with all individuals in the pedigree.  will have 0s in the row and column corresponding to the selected individual . The next individual (a new ) was then selected to maximize   and the relationships of the entire pedigree were made conditional on this second individual to give   where. Subsequent selection then proceeded using . This iterative procedure continued until  animals for dense genotyping had been selected. The exact solution would require a search through all subsets of size . The proposed algorithm is computationally faster and assumes that the set that is optimal for size  will be contained within the set that is optimal for size <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. For method MCG  it was assumed that the sparse genotypes of the target animals were available prior to the choice of animals for dense genotyping. This allowed the numerator relationship matrix  to be replaced by a genomic relationship  matrix based upon the sparse genotyping.  was constructed using the FG method described by[]: first  genotype probabilities were calculated with LDMIP[] using only the linkage analysis options  and a relationship matrix  was calculated following the principles of[]  averaging over all marker positions. Candidate animals were then selected as for MCA  except that  was substituted by . Method MCG was tested for each of the sparse marker densities (50  100 and 200 markers per Morgan)  which are denoted MCG-50  MCG-100 and MCG-200  respectively. Four of the remaining methods are heuristic. For KIN  the  animals in the pedigree that have the highest mean kinship coefficients with the animals in the target population were selected. Therefore  the selected  animals maximize   where  denotes an appropriately sized column vector of 1s. REL[] differs from KIN in that it selects the  animals that maximize the sum of the  variate regression coefficients of the allele counts for the target set on those for the selected set. (The heuristic justification for REL given in[] of maximizing relationships between selected and target animals is actually more appropriate to KIN). For SRS  the  individuals that have the largest numbers of sons and daughters in the pedigree were selected. For CON  the  animals selected were those that had the highest genetic contribution by descent to the target population  for which contributions were obtained from  in the LDL decomposition of the  matrix  as described by[]. Finally for RAN  a random sample of  animals was drawn from the whole pig pedigree without replacement. A forward simulator [] was used to simulate ideal populations in which SNP mutations were accumulated through generations of random mating by spontaneous mutations and recombinations. The effective sizes () of the ideal population were 100 and 200  and the mutation rate was 10 per base pair per meiosis. After 10 000 generations of random mating  the simulated SNP genotypes of the last generation were transmitted through the founders of the Landrace pedigree into the population by gene-dropping. The number of marker loci generated was equal to ~2200 loci/Morgan for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  and ~4900 loci/Morgan for <U+2009>=<U+2009>200. These numbers are close to the expected results of[] who reported 2120 loci for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  and 4790 for <U+2009>=<U+2009>200. Among the simulated loci  proportions 0.47 and 0.52 had a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.05 for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and 200  respectively. A further reduction in computing costs was obtained by simulating only one chromosome with a size of 1 Morgan (M)  which will not affect the accuracy of imputation. To test the accuracy of genomic evaluation  30 additive QTL were randomly selected from the segregating loci  ignoring MAF. The allelic effects at the QTL followed a Laplace distribution with mean 0 and scale parameter 1. Individual phenotypes were then simulated with a heritability of 0.02 by adding NIID error terms to the individual’s breeding value  which was the sum of the allelic effects at the QTL. Although accuracy of genotype imputation is not affected by the number of chromosomes simulated and trait heritability  genomic evaluation is. The use of a low heritability offsets the small 1 M genome size  according to the concept that accuracy of genomic prediction is determined by / where  is the effective number of independent segments in the genome[]. To simulate sparse genotyping  <U+2009>=<U+2009>50  100  or 200 loci were randomly sampled from among all available loci  including those that were sampled for the QTL. The minimum MAF for selected marker loci was equal to 0  0.05 or 0.10 and this was applied to the selection of loci assumed to be on the ‘sparse chip’  and to the selection of loci on the ‘dense chip’ that was used on the  animals used for training  and hence on genotypes to be imputed. The genotypes at the unselected loci in the sparse set were then reconstructed by using (i) Beagle[] or (ii) LDMIP[] which  unlike Beagle  exploits the available pedigree information. Genotypes were scored 0  1 or 2 corresponding to the number of mutant alleles in comparison to the reference alleles. Error rates were calculated as the frequency of incorrect imputed genotypes averaged over all loci and target animals. The correlation between imputed genotypes (scored as 0  1 and 2) and the true genotype among animals was calculated per locus and then averaged over all loci. The correlation has been shown to be much less dependent on MAF than error rates[]. Two genomic selection methods were used for GEBV estimation  MixP[] and GBLUP (Genomic best linear unbiased prediction)[]. GBLUP is reported to be robust in real data analyses  but it benefits less from an increase in the marker density and is indifferent to QTL architecture. The MixP method fits a mixture of two normal distributions to the SNP effects  similar to BayesC[]  and thus attempts to give extra weight to important markers and no weight to others  while keeping computation costs to a level comparable to GBLUP. The accuracies of the GEBV from the two methods were recorded  accuracy being defined as the correlation coefficient between the true simulated breeding values and GEBV. Methods RAN  KIN  CON  SRS  and MCA were compared for all combinations of the three values of   three MAF thresholds  two values of  and two values of  In this complete factorial design  all methods were replicated 1000 times and imputation was done with Beagle. For MCG  because there was some variation among replicates  the computational load was much greater and therefore the comparisons for MCG were restricted to all three values of  with  =100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>200  and with MAF greater than 0.05. In these cases  a minimum of 400 replicates was performed  which was sufficiently large to keep standard errors small relative to effects. Comparisons of the method REL to the other methods using Beagle were restricted to 400 replicates of <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 only. Comparisons of all seven methods using LDMIP for imputation rather than Beagle were also restricted to 400 replicates of <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 only. Table  summarizes the number of animals shared between the lists of animals selected for dense genotyping. KIN  CON  SRS and MCA share the property that they are constant over replicates conditional on the pedigree  unlike RAN. MCG also varies over replicates due to the simulation of new genotypes  with each replicate resulting in a different   and hence the selection of a different subset of  animals Therefore  the values shown in Table  for MCG are the averages of the shared numbers of individuals for the different values of . The strongest similarities were found between MCA and MCG. While the list obtained with SRS appeared to be the one that had the highest number of animals shared among the methods  MCA  KIN and CON have very little in common with each other. No individual was common to all four lists obtained with KIN  SRS  CON and MCA. As the sparse marker density    increased  the number of animals shared between MCG and SRS and MCA decreased. The imputation results are summarized in Figure . The proportion of markers correctly imputed and correlations between true and imputed genotypes for different values of  are in Figure a  and the correlations for different values of  and MAF thresholds are in Figure b. For all levels of  and  considered  methods MCG and MCA gave the most accurate imputation rates  although the benefits over SRS were generally not large. Imputation results using KIN or CON always gave the poorest accuracy and their performance was worse than that of RAN; typically the performance of CON was worse for <U+2009>50 SNPs/M  while that of KIN was worse for higher values of . Figure b shows the substantial benefits of increasing the size of the training set from <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 to <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and the loss in accuracy when using and predicting alleles with low MAF. The performance of REL was similar to that of KIN and CON; for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 with Beagle  the accuracy of imputation for REL was 0.56 c.f. 0.55  0.59 and 0.70 for KIN  CON and MCA  respectively. Note that results for <U+2009>=<U+2009>200  <U+2009>=<U+2009>50  MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 are in both Figures a and b.  <U+2009> Figure a shows the true call rate and the correlation between true and imputed genotypes for  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  and 200 SNP/Morgan with <U+2009>=<U+2009>200 and MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05; closed symbols with solid lines and open symbols with dashed lines denote the true call rate and correlation respectively; green  red and blue denote 200  100 and 50 SNPs/Morgan. Figure b shows the correlation between true and imputed genotypes for when <U+2009>=<U+2009>50 markers per Morgan for different  and MAF thresholds; closed symbols with solid lines and open symbols with dashed lines are <U+2009>200 and 100  respectively; black  dark and light grey denote thresholds of 0.10  0.05 and 0.00  respectively. The mean standard error of the correlation coefficients for both Figure a and b ranged from 2.83x10 to 1.78x10. When  increases  the effective number of segregating segments increases[] and the accuracy of GEBV is expected to decrease  which was observed. The genetic architecture of the design used in this study had relatively few QTL  so MixP was expected to have an advantage over GBLUP in terms of accuracy[]. When using only loci with a MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 instead of all loci  the difference in accuracy between MixP and GBLUP decreased; since the QTL were selected independently of their MAF  increasing the MAF threshold excluded more QTL and increased the reliance on LD with marker loci. The accuracies with true genotypes [see in Additional file: Table S1]. Since changes in  did not modify the ranking of the selection methods  results for <U+2009>=<U+2009>200 are not shown. Figure  shows the GEBV accuracy against the correlation between true and imputed genotypes when using GBLUP. Accuracies using imputed genotypes should be compared to accuracies of approximately 0.50 when using GBLUP with true genotypes  and all accuracies were less than this value  as expected. The differences between the selection methods mirrored those for imputation accuracy although differences in GEBV accuracy were smaller. [see Additional file: Table S2] contains the data that was used to generate Figure  and that permit the selection methods to be distinguished. Methods MCG and MCA gave the most accurate GEBV  while the accuracy was slightly lower with SRS. Typically  KIN gave the least accurate GEBV. The average results of the other sets lie in between these extremes. The effects of the different strategies for selection on the GEBV accuracy following imputation from MixP were similar to those for GBLUP  although the magnitudes of the accuracies were slightly greater when using MixP; these are not shown in Figure . It is clear that both between and within combinations of MAF and   the accuracy of the GEBV increased with the correlation between the true and imputed genotypes. Figure  also shows the regression of GEBV accuracy with GBLUP on genotype imputation accuracy within each MAF and  subclass.  <U+2009> <U+2009> Data are the means for each of the different methods when selecting the training set for <U+2009>=<U+2009>50  100 and 200 SNPs/Morgan and MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00  0.05 and 0.10; squares  triangles and circles denote 200  100 and 50 SNPs/Morgan  respectively and symbols in black  grey and white denote MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10  0.05 and 0.00  respectively; regression lines within MAF by  subclasses are also shown; identification of the different selection methods [see in Additional file: Table S2]; standard errors for accuracy of GEBV vary between 0.003 and 0.004. Clearly  the accuracy of GEBV increases with imputation accuracy. One interesting phenomenon is that higher genotype imputation accuracy does not necessarily mean higher GEBV accuracy (Figure ). For example  with a sparse marker density of 50 SNPs/Morgan  the imputation result is better with KIN than with CON  but the opposite occurred for the accuracy of GEBV estimations. This might be because KIN yielded greater imputation accuracy so close relatives were very accurately imputed  but the final GEBV had poorer accuracy because the less related animals impacted GEBV estimation. This phenomenon is observed in Figure  across values of  where equal accuracy of imputed SNPs does not directly translate to equal accuracy of GEBV; for example  this is the case when comparing 100 and 200 SNPs/Morgan for imputation accuracy of<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.8  perhaps because the denser SNP chip has more known genotypes. The effect of imputation accuracy on GEBV accuracy was studied in more detail by fitting linear models to the data on the accuracy of imputation and accuracy of GEBV when using GBLUP. Averaging over the selection methods for each  ×  × MAF subclass  the regression coefficient of the mean GEBV accuracy on mean imputation accuracy for the 18 subclasses was 0.491 (standard (se)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.008)  i.e. increasing imputation accuracy by 0.01 gave 0.005 extra accuracy in GEBV. However  within these subclasses  the pooled regression coefficient of GEBV accuracy on imputation accuracy was lower  i.e. 0.218 (se<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.009)  but with evidence (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) of variation in this regression among the 18 subclasses. Conditional on the observed imputation accuracy  the size of the imputation training set  had no further effect on the accuracy of GEBV  which might be as expected  and there was only a small trend (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.1) for the MAF threshold to have additional effects on accuracy  other than through imputation accuracy. However  marker density  had a strong effect on accuracy of GEBV after accounting for its effect on imputation (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001); compared to 50 SNPs/Morgan  accuracy of GEBV increased by an additional 0.031 (se<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13) and 0.070 (se<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.013) units for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 and 200 SNP/Morgan in this dataset  with an average accuracy of 0.4. Figure  shows all the data on accuracies of imputation and GEBV obtained with RAN. As  increased  the variance of imputation accuracy among replicates decreased faster than the variance of the accuracy of GEBV  and the regression of GEBV accuracy on imputation accuracy decreased  which suggests diminishing return in GEBV accuracy from increasing imputation accuracy. The variance of GEBV accuracy was larger than the variance of imputation accuracy because GEBV estimation has more sources of error.    The three groups of points correspond to  from left to right  50  100  and 200 markers per Morgan; dashed line is the regression line for all the data points and solid lines are the local regression lines fitted within each level of . Qualitatively  the results obtained when using LDMIP for imputation were largely similar to those when using Beagle. In particular  SRS  MCA and MCG remained superior to KIN  CON and REL in imputation accuracy and GEBV accuracy when using LDMIP instead of Beagle. LDMIP increased imputation accuracy compared to Beagle  with the correlation for MCA increasing from 0.70 (se<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) to 0.80 (se<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) for <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  <U+2009>=<U+2009>100  MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 [see in Additional file: Table S1]. With RAN  Beagle and LDMIP gave very similar accuracies  but for the lists that depend on relationships  LDMIP achieved greater imputation accuracy; this might be as expected since LDMIP uses family information for the imputation. The benefits of LDMIP in terms of GEBV accuracy were smaller in magnitude than for imputation accuracy. For example the accuracy of GEBV for MCA increased from 0.384 to 0.408 (se of the difference<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006). We have compared seven methods for prioritizing animals for dense genotyping  with the objective of imputing a set of target animals up to high-density genotype information. Although there was no selection to create the data used for testing  the commercial pedigree used was developed by selection. The two novel methods  MCA and MCG  that were developed for this objective  were shown to be superior over other methods  including heuristic methods based on contributions (CON  SRS) and relationships (KIN  REL). Somewhat surprisingly  there was relatively little overlap in animals between the lists  although the lists for SRS  MCA and MCG had considerable overlap. These last two lists  closely followed by SRS  were consistent in achieving the highest imputation accuracies. The list obtained with CON had a lower imputation accuracy because it tended to choose older ancestors that had been favored over generations by selection  hence making large contributions to the target population. However  since these ancestors are often only distantly related (through generations) to the target animals  the haplotypes they have in common are rather short and thus more difficult to detect by the imputation software. KIN will tend to focus on relationships with subsets of the target population and not with the whole population  whereas MCA and MCG use relationships but make the choice conditional on the impact of the set as a whole. The previously published method  REL  was markedly inferior[] and its performance was similar to that of KIN and CON. The differences in overall performance of all methods in[] were similar to those of REL (see the large difference in overall performance between MCA and REL observed here). One of the modifications (IDTS) carried out in[] adapts REL  but it makes the selection criterion for dense genotyping independent of the impact of those selected on the target population. Other criteria in[] consider heuristic empirical scoring criteria and so are unlikely to be easily generalized  even if performing well in particular situations. Minimizing the conditional variance based on the  matrix (MCA makes sense since the aim is to predict the missing genotypes and thus  conditional on (dense) genotypic information  to minimize the unexplained genetic variation. In the absence of any further information  we used the pedigree relationship matrix  to describe the genetic (co)variances between the animals. In the presence of sparse genotype information  we used the genomic relationship matrix  for this  i.e. the MCG method. One can also imagine a situation where some animals are sparsely genotyped and some are not genotyped  in which case the one-step method could be used to set up a relationship matrix across these two types of animals  [    ]. Similar to MCG  the  matrix could be used to minimize the conditional variances i.e. the MCH method. In this case  it will be important to regress the sparse-markers-based  matrix back to the  matrix[] (see[] for incorporation into the one-step method) in order to account for the imperfect prediction accuracy of sparse markers. The observation that sires with the largest number of sons and daughters gave good GEBV accuracy is reasonable since (1) in our example  they contributed most genomes to the target animals; and (2) they are a set of relatively distantly related animals that are in part selected in order to avoid inbreeding in the breeding scheme. Experience from applying this methodology to other commercial pedigrees (not shown here) supports large but imperfect correspondence between the lists arising from MCA and the individuals with the largest number of offspring in the target population. Interestingly  random lists performed reasonably well and resulted in more accurate GEBV than CON and KIN  and may be considered because of its ease of implementation. The empirical positive relationship between imputation accuracy and accuracy of GEBV when using the imputed genotypes needs to be interpreted with care since it is not absolute. For example  imputation accuracy was increased by avoiding the imputation (prediction) of genotypes at loci with low MAF (see Figure b). However  when true genotypes were used  the inclusion of low MAF loci increased the accuracy of the GEBV [see in Additional file: Table S1]  contrary to this empirical relationship  although the ranking of the methods for selecting those for dense genotyping was not affected. Thus  in a genomic selection scheme  loci with low MAF should not be ignored. We proposed and tested two novel criteria (MCA and MCG) for prioritizing animals for dense genotyping when the intended use of the dense genotyping is to impute the missing marker data on sparsely genotyped animals in a target population. The two criteria apply to (i) when only pedigree information is available  MCA  and (ii) when all animals are already sparsely genotyped  MCG. MCA and MCG minimize the conditional genetic variance in the target population based on  respectively  the numerator relationship matrix  and the genomic  matrix calculated from the sparse genotypes. The simulation study showed that the new criteria resulted in higher imputation accuracies of the missing genotypes than alternative criteria such as selecting a random set of animals for dense genotyping  selecting sires with the largest number of offspring  selecting animals that were most related to the target population  or selecting animals that had the highest genetic contributions to the target population.

This paper also shows that ignoring the existence of this major gene in genetic evaluation of prolificacy can lead to a large overestimation of polygenic breeding values. The Lacaune sheep breed is the main breed raised in France  with approximately 1.2 million ewes. There are different strains of this breed  depending on the production purpose (dairy or meat). In 1975  the artificial insemination (AI) cooperative Ovi-Test designed a selection program to increase prolificacy of sheep bred for meat production []. Prolificacy is considered as a difficult trait to select for because of its low polygenic inheritance. However  the improvement in prolificacy was higher than expected with  between 1975 and 1996  an increase from 1.28 to 1.98 for ewe lambs mated at approximately 11 months of age in June and July []. This rapid response to selection  together with several other observations  suggested a non-polygenic inheritance and the segregation of a major gene in this population []. Since 1982 and the first evidence of a major gene for prolificacy in Booroola Merinos [  ]  various studies demonstrated or suspected the existence of major genes in other breeds [  ]. In the Lacaune meat sheep population  two major genes that affect prolificacy have been identified: (1) the  mutation (C53Y) of the  gene  which is located on the X chromosome and results in a high ovulation rate (1.5 additional ova per ewe) in heterozygous ewes and sterility in homozygous mutated ewes [] and (2) the  gene that is located on chromosome 11 and for which two SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) close or within the  gene are candidate causal mutations [  ]. The  gene has two alleles and each copy of the mutant allele (designated L) increases ovulation rate by approximately 1.5 additional ova compared to the wild allele (designated +). In 2006  allele frequencies of both genes were estimated in the Lacaune sheep population by genotyping the males at the AI centre [] and the proportion of ewes with the mutant allele was estimated at 15% for  and 45% for . Homozygous mutant animals for either of these genes are not adapted to breeders’ needs because of the sterility of  homozygous ewes and excessive prolificacy of  homozygous ewes. Moreover  some on-farm observations and experimental data [] showed that the prolificacy of double heterozygous animals reached levels similar to that of homozygous  animals. Because of the relative frequencies of each of these genes  the sterility induced by the  mutation in the  gene  the excessive prolificacy of homozygous  ewes  and the poor prolificacy of wild type ewes  the Ovi-Test cooperative chose to remove animals that carried the  mutation from its population and to manage the  gene at the heterozygous state. Thus  since 2002 all sires are genotyped for both genes and  since 2010 every replacement ewe lamb is genotyped for the  gene. In 2006  the first estimate of the effect of the  mutation on prolificacy was reported []  but only a few ewes from commercial flocks were genotyped at the time and the study compared the daughters of carrier and non-carrier sires. The recent systematic genotyping program has provided a large amount of data. Using this data  the present study aimed at estimating the effect of the  mutation on prolificacy in a large and unselected sample. Potential effects on fertility after AI  lamb growth and mortality were also analysed to check if the mutation affects these traits directly  since they are important traits for the breeders. In addition  we quantified the bias in estimates of the additive polygenic values since  currently the evaluation process of estimated breeding values (EBV) considers that genetic effects are transmitted according to Fisher's infinitesimal model []. The cooperative nucleus consisted of 26 breeder flocks  with 430 ewes per flock on average (from around 150 to 1000)  and a total of 11 201 ewes in June 2013. Most flocks perform three lambings every two years. This breeding program is on-going. Male candidates used in the nucleus are preselected when they are about 45 days old and are genotyped for  when they enter the central testing station for own performance test. Then  they are selected on their own performances for growth  fatness and conformation. Those with less favourable performances (about 50%) are used for natural mating in the nucleus  sold or slaughtered  while the best males continue on in the selection process and undergo a progeny test set up on-farm by AI. The females used as replacement ewes are chosen among the AI-born lambs (about 40% of the lambs result from AI in the nucleus). The first mating for these replacement ewes is a natural mating (ewe lambs are not artificially inseminated in this breeding program). In order to manage the  gene within the population to address the breeder’s goal of optimal prolificacy  the Ovi-Test cooperative imposed various mating rules. The objective is to obtain a nucleus consisting of 50% heterozygous ewes (designated L+) and 50% homozygous wild-type ewes (designated ++)  and to minimize the production of homozygous mutant ewes (designated LL). When AI is used  L<U+2009>+<U+2009>and LL ewes must be mated to ++ rams  and ++ females to L<U+2009>+<U+2009>rams. Only ++ rams can be used for natural mating. From 2004 to 2009  the presence of the  mutation was predicted by a combination of alleles at three microsatellite loci that determine an L-haplotype that was never detected on wild-type chromosomes [  ]. Since 2009   genotyping is based on SNP  803A<U+2009>><U+2009>G (GenBank accession number FJ654646)  which is in high linkage disequilibrium with the  mutation (<1% recombination) and located in the 3' UTR sequence of the  gene []. Until recently  it was the most efficient marker that INRA could transfer to Aveyron-labo  the commercial genotyping company that performs the genomic analyses for the Lacaune breed. All data (performances for AI result  litter size  lamb mortality and growth; pedigree over five generations) were extracted from the national database for genetic evaluation and research managed by the Institut de l’Elevage (French Livestock Production Institute) and the CTIG (Centre de Traitement de l'Information Génétique  Jouy-en-Josas  France). Only females born after 2010 (when consistent genotyping of replacement ewes began) and sires genotyped since 2002 and used in the nucleus were retained (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5775 and 1025  respectively). However  too few LL ewes were available to calculate accurate estimates for this genotype and they were removed; thus only ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotypes were compared. Allele and genotype frequencies were estimated separately for female and male populations. Potential changes in frequencies between years  as well as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  were tested with a Chi-squared test. In addition to the genotype of the ewe  many factors can affect the four traits analysed and they were defined as similar as possible to those of the national genetic evaluation system. However  not all factors were tested for each model due to the structure of the data. The list of factors tested for each trait and included in the final analysis is in Table . The fixed effects and all one-way interactions with biological meaning included in the models were initially selected step-by-step using nested models that were compared with the likelihood ratio test. These models were fitted using the mixed procedure of SAS V9.2  while final analyses were performed using the ASReml software []. The distribution of raw litter size (LS) per genotype is in Table . A total of 4260 records from ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes were used. Litter size is a categorical trait that has to be analysed by a threshold model []  assuming the existence of an underlying normal variable and a set of thresholds that determine the observed categories. In this study  to avoid extreme case problems []  litters of more than three lambs were clustered into a single class. Once the final model was chosen  fixed effects and variances were estimated with a threshold animal mixed model []. The model was fitted with the fixed effects chosen as described previously (Table ). The model considered a standard normal underlying variable N(0 <U+2009>1) and a set of thresholds shared both by ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotypes  as well as their interaction with genotype  resulting in a set of thresholds for each genotype ({} and {}). Since a drastic relationship between mean and variance exists for sheep prolificacy []  the comparison of variances on the observed scale was not direct but based on the predicted distribution of LS for each genotype through a back transformation to the observable scale using the estimated thresholds for each genotype (). The probability of response in the  category for genotype  was computed for an underlying variable N( <U+2009>1) as:  setting  and . Then  mean and variance were estimated for a given  as: and . These calculations were done for several values of . Another more illustrative method is proposed in the Appendix. It consists in a transformation of the threshold sets estimated for ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes into a common set for both genotypes and instead of fixed parameters ( = 0  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1) for the underlying variable to give specific values for each genotype. In this case  the variance of the underlying variable is higher for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>than for ++ ewes. Both methods provide similar evidence that the  gene affects both the mean and the variability of litter size. Polygenic heritability was estimated by the ratio of the animal variance component to the total variance on the underlying scale  which was equal to the sum of the animal variance component and the residual variance; that last variance was set to 1 in this threshold model. Since the mutation affects the number of ovulations  it was relevant to investigate whether it also affects their quality  which can be assessed indirectly by female fertility. Since conditions of natural mating are not well documented in our database  in this study we focused on the effect of the gene on AI fertility. Because ewe lambs were not artificially inseminated in the nucleus  the data used to evaluate the effect of genotype on the success of AI included only a particular sub-sample of ewes. These ewes were more than 14 months old and were primiparous or multiparous when inseminated. Because the number of inseminated ewes that had suckled three or more lambs during their last litter was very small  they were discarded from the analysis. The fixed effects considered for this trait are shown in Table . For this sub-sample  the interval of time since the last lambing was considered as a covariate and the season was divided into three periods (November to March  April  and May to July). Finally  for the 1206 available ewes  the AI was considered as fertile if lambing occurred between 142 and 152 days after it was performed. AI success is a discrete variable for which genotype and other fixed effects were estimated using a threshold animal mixed model. The aim of this analysis was to observe the effect of dam genotype on the weight of lambs at 30 days of age (30dLW)  which is used as a maternal capacity selection criterion in the Ovi-Test breeding program. It was carried out only in 17 flocks in which all lambs were weighed at about 30 days of age. Because some lambs were not weighed at exactly 30 days  the 30dLW was calculated by linear regression using the actual weight at the given age and a fixed birth weight for each lamb category (sex  litter size). The variable 30dLW was analysed for 3829 lambs using a linear animal mixed model  with fixed effects as described in Table . The effect of dam genotype on lamb survival was studied by measuring lamb mortality from birth to 30 days of age. Sex could not be included as a fixed effect because the gender of stillborn lambs was unknown. The rearing type was discarded for similar reasons. This binary trait was analysed for 8338 lambs using a threshold animal mixed model. Bias in estimates of additive polygenic values for prolificacy of the 2711 genotyped females with lambing records was estimated by comparing BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) of their breeding values from a threshold animal mixed model which did (EBV|) or did not (EBV) include the genotype effect as a fixed effect. Comparison of these EBV between ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes was done by a simple ANOVA. Bias due to ignoring the genotype effect in the evaluation of breeding values were assessed within genotypes by comparing the difference between EBVand EBV| with a paired Student's t-test and the slopes of the regressions of EBVon EBV| Genotype frequencies of the female genotyped population are in Table  by year of birth and genotype frequencies of the sires are in Table . The frequency of the L allele in the replacement females was 15.3%. For these females  the genotype frequencies were very stable and did not depend on year of birth (P-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.50); globally they were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05). Moreover  genotype frequencies differed between the farms  with values ranging from 62.1 to 81.7% (average [standard deviation]<U+2009>=<U+2009>70.5 [5.2]) for ++ ewes  from 17.9 to 34.7% (27.3 [4.6]) for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes  and from 0.0 to 6.3% (2.15 [1.4]) for LL ewes. The frequency of the mutation was slightly higher in sires genotyped between 2002 and 2013 (17.4%) than observed for ewes  which resulted in slightly different genotype frequencies compared with the females (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02) but genotype frequencies satisfied Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99). The linear model run to select the significant effects showed highly significant effects for genotype (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  oestrus type (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  flock (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)  month of lambing (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and the composite effect or physiological status of the dam at lambing (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). In the threshold animal mixed model  the interaction between thresholds and genotypes was significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and the likelihood ratio test showed a better data fit when a separate set of thresholds was considered for each genotype ({t} and {t})  compared considering a common set of thresholds {t} and an effect of genotype on the mean of the underlying variable. As expected  estimates of the thresholds were lower for the prolific L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes than for the ++ ewes (Table )  but the sets of thresholds could not be simply translated between the genotypes. Since the model was not linear  predictions were obtained for a given combination of levels of fixed effects. Predictions of LS corresponded to the actual estimated value when the mean  of the underlying variable was set to 0 for each genotype. The difference in means on the observable scale was then equal to 0.47 lambs per lambing. Other values of  led to theoretical distributions of LS. Figure  shows that regardless of the value of  (within a range which gives a mean on the observable scale between 1.60 and 2.20)  the variance on the observable scale was always higher for the L<U+2009>+<U+2009>than for the ++ genotype. In particular  an underlying variable N(0.86  1) associated with the thresholds {} led to the same mean on the observed scale than an underlying variable N(0  1) associated the thresholds {} but resulted in a much higher variability for the L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotype (+39%). Another way to show that the  gene has an effect on both the mean and variance of the trait is presented in the Appendix.   Predicted mean and variance of litter size on the observable scale were calculated for each genotype by combining the specific set of thresholds {t} and {t} with an underlying variable <U+039D>(<U+03B7>  1) for which the mean <U+03B7> varied from -1 to +1. Plain markers correspond to the underlying variable <U+039D>(0  1) of the output of the threshold model. The polygenic genetic variance was estimated at 0.156  which resulted in a polygenic heritability in the underlying scale of 0.14 (s.e. = 0.020). As expected  estimates of additive genetic variance and heritability were higher when the model did not include the effect of genotype (genetic variance<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.221; heritability<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.18 (s.e. = 0.02)). Genotype of the ewe (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.016)  flock (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  rearing mode (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05)  interval since the last lambing (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04)  and number of lambs suckled in the previous litter (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) had a significant effect on the AI fertility. The average fertility observed following AI was high (0.74) and higher for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes (0.79) than for ++ ewes (0.72). Based on results of the model  L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes were significantly more fertile than ++ ewes (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.016) and fertility decreased as the number of lambs suckled in the previous litter increased (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). The difference between genotypes was 0.3 on the underlying scale. Predictions on the observed scale were obtained for a given combination of levels of fixed effects. For ewes in a flock with an average effect  rearing a single lamb  and having suckled two lambs at the previous lambing  the difference between genotypes was 11% points on the observed scale: 62% for ++ ewes and 73% for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes. Genotype of the dam  flock  month of lambing  physiological status and birth type of the dam  and sex  birth and rearing type of the lamb had significant effects on 30dLW (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Male lambs were heavier than female lambs and the weight decreased when the birth type or the rearing type increased. When all possible sources of variation linked to dam prolificacy but independent of the  genotype were taken into account  lambs of ++ dams were about 300 g heavier at 30 days of age (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) than lambs of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>dams. This difference accounted for about 3% of the lamb’s weight at this age. Flock (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  month of lambing (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04)  rearing type of the dam (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05)  and lambing rank (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001) had significant effects on the risk of mortality. The effect of genotype of the dam was not significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13) but the interaction between birth type of the lamb and dam genotype was significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). However  the difference between genotypes was significant only for twin litters (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). In order to better characterize this effect  the model was run again for twin lambs only. The probability of death was higher for twin lambs of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>dams than for those of ++ dams and the estimated difference between the genotypes was 0.19 on the underlying scale. For a particular combination of fixed effects (average flock  lambing in May  first lambing)  these estimates converted to probabilities of 0.155 and 0.114  for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>and ++ dams respectively. When the genotype effect was included in the model  there was no significant difference between estimated additive polygenic breeding values (EBV|) of ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes (Table )  whereas when this effect was ignored  estimated polygenic breeding values (EBV) were significantly lower for ++ than for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). The latter difference was greater than 1 standard deviation unit of the EBV| (s<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.192). Ignoring the genotype effect led to a very small underestimation of additive polygenic values for ++ ewes and a large overestimation for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes of about 1 standard deviation unit of the EBV| (Table ). Furthermore  the slope of the regression of EBV on EBV| showed that the small underestimation of additive polygenic values was almost constant for the ++ genotype (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.07  standard error<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01) while the overestimation observed for the L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotype increased slightly when the additive polygenic value increased (ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.30  standard error<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02). The genotype frequencies observed in females were slightly different from those estimated in 2006 (Ovi-Test  personal communication). Two reasons could explain these differences. First  the study performed in 2006 was based on a small number of genotyped animals. Moreover  before consistently genotyping replacement ewes  the cooperative excluded animals that were genetically estimated as very prolific. Males with an EBV for prolificacy greater than 1.5 standard deviation units above the mean  and ewes with an EBV greater than 3 standard deviation units above the mean were automatically discarded from the breeding program. This strategy  which was used from 1996 to 2010 to avoid animals that were too prolific  probably reduced the proportion of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>animals. The high stability of genotype frequencies observed since 2011 is not really surprising  despite the cooperative’s aim to achieve 50% of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes. A substantial number of genotyped ewes ready for insemination were available only in 2012 and a too sudden change in genotype frequencies would not be suitable for the breeders. The considerable variation in genotype frequencies observed between flocks was somewhat surprising since by obligation  all replacement ewes in the nucleus originated from collective AI sires. This rule was set up at the beginning of the selection scheme in 1975 and is still compulsory. Therefore  these differences in genotype frequencies could result from the different strategies implemented by individual breeders to select their replacement ewes. Some breeders may select ewe lambs born as triplets  and most probably born from carrier dams  whereas others may avoid keeping these smaller ewe lambs. These counter-selection procedures  together with the higher mortality of progeny born from prolific carrier ewes  also explain the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium observed for females. In contrast  the male selection strategy is imposed by the cooperative as a group strategy. It slightly favours the carriers  counterbalancing their higher mortality  which brings the male genotype frequencies back to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The effect of the  mutation on prolificacy found in the present study agrees with the first observations previously reported []. As for other major genes that affect prolificacy in sheep  the effect is lower on this trait than on ovulation rate [      –]. The increase of about 0.5 lambs per lambing for one copy of the mutant allele is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of all other known major genes for prolificacy. However  it is slightly lower than the prolificacy increase previously reported for Booroola ewes (+0.9 to 1.2 lambs per litter) that carry a single copy of the mutant Booroola allele []. The estimate of the effect of  on prolificacy is also similar to the lowest effect of the Booroola gene stated in the extensive review performed by Fogarty []. It is also lower than the effect of a single copy of the  gene that contains either the Hanna [] or Inverdale [] mutations  the Belclare or Galway mutations []  or the Rasa Aragonesa []  Lacaune [] or Olkuska [] mutations. However the effect reported here seems much higher than the effect of the Grivette mutation of the same  gene []. The four known mutations in the  gene in Belclare []  Thoka []  Santa Ines [] and Norwegian White Sheep populations [] also induce a slightly higher increase in LS in the heterozygous state than the  mutation. As for most mutations that do not induce sterility at the homozygous level  the prolificacy of homozygous LL ewes is too high and not useful for breeders. The significant interaction between the set of thresholds and genotype can be interpreted as a double effect of the genotype  impacting the mean of LS and also its variability in addition to the systematic increase induced by the mean change. If the difference between prolificacy of ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes had resulted only in a simple shift in the mean of the underlying variable  as was observed between breeds by Bodin and Elsen []  it would have induced a much lower increase in the observed variability of LS (see Additional file : Table S1); in particular  the percentage of twin lambing would have increased up to 64% in L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes compared to 51% actually observed (see Additional file : Figure S1). To our knowledge  this is the first time that a major gene controlling the mean of LS has been reported to have an additional effect on the variability of the trait. Due to the low number of LL ewes  we could not determine whether the same effect would be conserved if a second copy of the mutant allele was added. This effect on the mean and the variability is perhaps not common to all major genes that affect LS in sheep and could result from specific physiological mechanisms that are regulated by the Lacaune gene. It is known that  in contrast to other mutations  the  mutation induces shorter delays of pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) surges after sponge withdrawal [] and that treatments used for oestrus synchronisation (which also modify these events) have an important effect on the variability of LS []. Therefore  it would interesting to determine whether the LS variability is further increased in L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes that are synchronized with the classical synchronisation treatment (vaginal sponge impregnated with injections of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) at withdrawal) compared with non-treated L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes. The estimates of the genetic parameters for prolificacy were in agreement with estimates reported in the literature from threshold models [  ] or from linear models [] and transformation using the formula given by Gianola []. However  in our case  the estimate of additive genetic variance  which was found to be towards the upper limit of the range of values found in the literature  included the permanent environmental variance  which could not be efficiently estimated in an independent manner. Although the estimate of heritability of LS obtained when ignoring the existence of the major gene was biased  the estimate was lower than the very high estimates found in the same Lacaune population in 1988 after 12 years of intensive selection for prolificacy (heritability<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.37 [])  or in 2001 after 25 years of selection (heritability<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.39 []). The lower estimate obtained in this study results from the strict management rules that have been implemented over the last 12 years to prevent the gene from being disseminated too rapidly and  most of all  to avoid producing homozygous animals. The lower heritability also results from the elimination of the  mutation  which was still segregating in 2001 []. Finally  based on the estimate of the gene effect and its frequency in the current Lacaune population  the  gene accounts for a very large part (42%) of the total additive genetic variance and this could explain the rapid increase in genetic progress for LS observed in this population. The rate of AI success was very high in this data and higher than the value reported in dairy Lacaune sheep []  although the latter strain is renowned for its very high AI results. In our data  the age of the ewes and the insemination periods were favourable and these factors  together with the fact that 2012 was a good year for AI fertility in Lacaune sheep  could explain this high success rate. To our knowledge  this is first time that a major gene controlling prolificacy is reported to have an effect on fertility  except for some  and  mutations in the homozygous state [  –  ]. This effect might be explained by the particular endocrine profile of LL ewes when compared with ewes that carry mutations in other major genes (    ) []. Indeed  after sponge withdrawal following a classical progestative treatment  FSH and LH surges appear 20 h earlier in LL ewes than in ++ ewes []. Although these results were observed without the PMSG injection  which normally follows the progestative treatment at the time of insemination  the difference in delay in the LH surge might explain the effect on fertility due to a difference in the optimum time for AI after sponge withdrawal. However  the higher fertility of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes would indicate that the delay between the end of the treatment and AI is not optimal for ++ Lacaune ewes. Before changing this delay  it is necessary to accumulate and analyze more data that take other potential variation factors  which were not available in our study  into account []. The effect of the  genotype of the dams on the weight of their lambs at 30 days was quite surprising and no similar effects have ever been described for other major prolificacy genes. The data available did not enable us to determine whether the difference between lambs was due to weight at birth  growth between 0 and 30 days  or both. A difference in weight at birth could be due to a higher rate of embryonic losses in the carrier ewes. It has been observed that  in the event of embryonic losses  the remaining foetuses weigh less at birth than foetuses from litters of similar size but without embryonic losses []. Therefore  the possible influence of the dam’s genotype on embryonic mortality requires further study. Another hypothesis is that the difference in lamb weight at 30 days of age is due to different maternal abilities of the two genotypes. It can be assumed that such differences in dairy capacities exist but that they are not directly due to the effect of the  gene. In the breeding program used in this study  animals were selected on a genetic index  combining EBV for prolificacy and maternal ability. Thus  animals with very good prolificacy EBV were selected even if their dairy EBV was moderate  and conversely animals with a very high maternal ability value were selected even if their prolificacy value was slightly lower than average. Because the average prolificacy EBV of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>animals was higher than that of ++ ewes  it is possible that these L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes were selected despite their low maternal ability. The likelihood of death was higher for twin lambs born from L<U+2009>+<U+2009>dams than from ++ dams. This result was surprising. Indeed  the effect of birth type on lamb mortality is well documented [  ]  and the effect of the  gene most probably results from the higher ovulation rate and pregnancy wastage of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes  as is the case for F<U+2009>+<U+2009>Booroola ewes []. However  there is no clear explanation for the interaction between dam genotype and litter size  except the low statistical power of the test due to the low number of triplets born from ++ ewes. If differences in mortality exist between the progenies of ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes  they are probably lower than those observed for litters of twins. In particular  for litter sizes of 1  for which a large amount of data is available for both genotypes  the gene effect is very low and the associated P value is high (P<U+2009>><U+2009>075). If this effect is confirmed  it would be necessary to genotype the dam and its lambs (even those that die before 30 days) in order to separate the maternal and direct effects of the gene. When the evaluation model included the effect of genotype  the EBV accounted only for the polygenic effects and  as expected  there was no difference between the ++ and the L<U+2009>+<U+2009>animals. In contrast  when the genotype was not included in the model  its effect was not dissociated from the polygenic effects and was included in the EBV  which led to much higher EBV for L<U+2009>+<U+2009>than for ++ ewes. For L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes  this bias in the estimates of the additive polygenic values  assessed by the difference between EBV and EBV|  was very large and can contribute to biased selection for polygenic values. Furthermore  the increase of bias when the additive polygenic value of L<U+2009>+<U+2009>ewes increased  might express an interaction of the  mutation with the rest of the genome or more simply with another gene. Although carrier sires of the  mutation are systematically discarded from breeding  this mutation is still present in the female population and might contribute to this interaction. The bias observed for ++ ewes was much lower  perhaps due to the high percentage of this genotype in the sample. For several reasons (economic superiority of heterozygous ewes  optimization of future genetic progress  etc.)  the global genetic values should not be used for selection and the gene effect should be separated from the polygenic effects in the genetic evaluation. Before changing the entire evaluation system  a first improvement would be to estimate a pseudo polygenic EBV for animals with a known genotype. This pseudo polygenic EBV would be assessed by removing or adding the value of the genotype from the current individual EBV. However  in the future  the evaluation model will take the genotype effect into account  which will be estimated as in the present study. Individuals without known genotypes would be assigned a unique common genotype or individual probabilities of each genotype. Genotype probabilities can be calculated exactly using iterative peeling [] when there is no inbreeding  or estimated in the case of a complex pedigree with many loops []. The large amount of genotyping data accumulated for  in the Lacaune sheep of the Ovi-Test population since 2011 has enabled us to better estimate genotype frequencies and the effect of this gene on prolificacy and fertility (traits related to quantity and quality of ovulation)  as well as other important traits for breeders. The negative effects of the maternal genotype on growth and mortality of lambs are nevertheless relatively low in comparison to the effects on litter size and fertility after AI. The increase in variability of litter size due to the  mutation is not a negative outcome  to the extent that triplets are accepted by breeders. However  since some breeders wish to limit the number of triplets and to avoid litter sizes greater than 3 at all cost  management of the  gene should be associated with a reduction of litter size variability  perhaps by canalyzing selection []. This paper also shows that ignoring the existence of a major gene in genetic evaluation could lead to a large overestimation of polygenic breeding values for prolificacy. A threshold model of categorical traits supposes an underlying variable with a standard normal distribution and a set of thresholds which transforms this continuous variable into a multinomial variable with  ordered categories. However  any threshold model with two thresholds <U+2009>~<U+2009>N(0 <U+2009>1) ; {   } can be re-parameterized by a homothetic transformation that scales and shifts the set of thresholds to the values of a reference model and changes accordingly the parameters of the underlying variable. Thus  two models:<U+2009>~<U+2009>N and <U+2009>~<U+2009>N are strictly equivalent to the two models: <U+2009>~<U+2009>N and <U+2009>~<U+2009>N<U+2009>  where  and . It is then possible to interpret the differences of these models having the same set of thresholds  by a shift  and a scaling effect  of the underlying variable of the model for . This homothetic transformation can be also used for re-parameterization of models with three thresholds if In other cases  an approximate re-parameterization can be done if In this case  the values of the two first thresholds of the common new set can be those of the reference threshold set   but the third is given by  with . In our particular case  if one argues that the third threshold for the ++ genotype (corresponding to litters of more than three lambs) was poorly estimated (322 litters of three lambs in 4071 lambing; 7.91%<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.09)  it was possible to change the parameters by an approximate re-parameterization (see Additional file : Table S1). This parameter transformation induced a small change of the third threshold for the ++ genotype that resulted in a negligible change of the estimated percent of triple lambing (from 5.36 to 5.61%). By this transformation  we can interpret the effect of the gene as an increase of the mean and an 81% increase of the underlying variance for the L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotype (see Additional file : Table S1). Figure S1 (see Additional file : Figure S1) shows the distribution of LS for ++ and L<U+2009>+<U+2009>genotypes with this approximate re-parameterization. Figure S1 (see Additional file : Figure S1) also shows the theoretical LS distribution of a population with an increased L<U+2009>+<U+2009>mean but a conserved ++ variance.

Our hypothesis that intermediate-aged relationships yield more accurate genomic predictions than  was confirmed for two of four traits  but these results were not statistically significant. Use of estimated genotype probabilities for ungenotyped animals proved to be an efficient method to include the phenotypes of ungenotyped animals. Wright’s [] numerator relationship matrix    is based on pedigree relationships and relies on the assumption of a base population  in which animals are unrelated  i.e.  without known parents and non-inbred. Relationship and inbreeding coefficients are expressed in terms of Identity-by-Descent (IBD) probabilities  where the IBD occurs after the base population was established. If the base population is moved further back in time  IBD probabilities increase and eventually approach 1. Inbreeding coefficients (F) and relationships should thus be evaluated relative to each other and not in terms of their absolute values. For instance  the rate of inbreeding  <U+0394>F = (F<U+2009>-<U+2009>F)/(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>F)  expresses the difference in inbreeding between generations t and t-1 relative to the maximum level of inbreeding  and is robust to the choice of the base population. For practical reasons  base populations are usually quite recent  because old pedigrees may not be available  or are rather incomplete  or because numerator relationships () reduce quickly over generations and Best Linear Unbiased Prediction of Breeding Values based on  (ABLUP-EBV) are not much affected by information from old ancestors. GBLUP-EBV are BLUP- estimated breeding values based on genomic relationship matrices    and are commonly used in genomic selection (GS) [  ]. Genomic relationship matrices are based on alleles at molecular genetic markers being Identical-By-State (IBS). When tracing the inheritance of the two marker alleles back in time  their paths of inheritance eventually coalesce into a single common ancestor  and IBS thus implies that there was no mutation in any of these inheritance paths. Because of this (ancient) common ancestor  two alleles that are IBS are also IBD. Thus  marker-based IBS relationship matrices are also expressed relative to a base population  which is on average 1/(2<U+03BD>) generations ago  where <U+03BD> is the SNP mutation rate  as shown by [] but considering recombination events instead of mutations. However  if the effective population size  N  is small  the two paths coalesce rapidly  which implies that only recent mutations result in DNA polymorphisms (old mutations have either been fixed or lost in a small population). Thus  for small N  a slightly higher mutation rate may be assumed in the 1/(2<U+03BD>) term to mimic the young age of most mutations. Especially when the markers on the SNP panel were selected based on having high minor allele frequencies (MAF)  the SNP markers reflect rather old mutations. This is because all mutations start at a low frequency  and most mutations are lost before reaching substantial allele frequencies. It follows that low MAF alleles are mainly due to young mutations and high MAF alleles represent quite old mutations. Thus  if markers are selected based on high MAF  marker mutations may well predate QTL mutations that affect traits of interest  because traits of interest have been under selection  and old mutations that affect them were either lost or fixed. In the case of disease resistance traits  natural selection may have weeded out deleterious alleles and existing genetic variation may be due to relatively recent mutations. Even for neutral loci  e.g. for a neutral trait  there will be relatively more low MAF genes than on the SNP-chip. IBS between alleles at a locus for two gametes is strictly defined as the molecular coancestry  i.e.   where x (x) is the allele state code (x<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 or 1) for gamete i (j) []. VanRaden’s [] estimate of the genomic relationship is   assuming allele frequencies of 0.5 in order to maximise expected relationships. Since   these estimates are proportional to each other  and we will thus consider the resulting genomic relationship matrix    as indicating IBS relationships. IBS-based relationship matrices  as commonly used in GS  reflect rather old relationships  whereas pedigree-based relationships    are rather young and decay quickly. The latter may be improved by the use of relationship matrices based on genome-wide linkage analysis  G  which combine pedigree and marker information  which in dairy cattle have yielded similar accuracies as GBLUP []. However  linkage analysis relationships may be as young as pedigree relationships  or even younger when the base population is put forward in time due to lack of genotype data on old ancestors. Although  and  relationship matrices yielded very similar accuracies []  they contain quite different relationships  which suggests that intermediate-aged relationships may improve the accuracy of GS. Habier et al. [] distinguished three sources of information for GS: (i) family relationships  as contained in the pedigree; (ii) linkage analysis information  as contained in   which they called co-segregation of alleles; and (iii) linkage disequilibrium (LD) information  as contained in   and which is already present in the base population. This distinction of information sources coincides well with our distinction of ages of the relationships  indicating that the relationships at different ages tend to reflect fundamentally different sources of information. In view of this background  it seems that the  matrix traces relationships that are too old and  traces only very recent relationships. Thus  we hypothesised that relationships of more intermediate age are more appropriate for GS  and developed a haplotype-based relationship matrix    since recombination of haplotypes occurs more frequently than mutations at single SNPs. Our aim was to compare relationship matrices that express relationships over different genetic distances (ages)  and the resulting accuracies of GS in a pig breeding situation. Genotyping and phenotyping data were kindly provided by Norsvin AS. Genotypes from 3250 Norwegian Landrace pigs were available  of which 2553 boars came from the boar-test station and 697 dams from the nucleus herds  all born between 2010 and 2013. All animals were genotyped at CIGENE ()  using the porcine 60 K SNP array from Illumina (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). Clustering and genotype calling were performed using the genotyping module in the Genome Studio software (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA). In total  60 451 SNPs were used for genotyping  and 38 453 informative markers passed quality control  which was based on having a MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01  call frequency<U+2009>><U+2009>0.10  and parent–child Mendelian errors<U+2009><<U+2009>0.025. Samples were included in the analysis if their call rate was<U+2009>><U+2009>75%  although the average call rate was equal to 99.5% with a standard deviation of 1.6%. Parentage tests are routinely performed for all boars at the boar test station so no pedigree errors were observed. Occasional missing genotypes were imputed and the genotype data were phased using Beagle v3.3.1 []. After quality control  a total of 3250 genotyped animals were available for analysis. The pedigree of the genotyped animals was traced back for five generations to form a pedigree file containing 8187 animals. Four traits were chosen for analysis  mainly based on their high frequency of recording  such that the number of animals with missing phenotypes was relatively small. The traits were a mixture of production  product quality and reproduction traits: growth rate (GR)  measured in number of days required to grow from 25 to 100 kg live weight; meat percentage (M%)  which is measured on live evaluation of boars by computer tomography  using Norsvin’s image analysis software (Jørgen Kongsro  Norsvin  personal communication); weight at 3 weeks of age (W3W)  which is mainly viewed as a fitness trait of the piglet; number of teats (NT)  which is counted on both males and females. All available phenotypes on all 8187 animals in the pedigree were collected  including on non-genotyped animals. The number of phenotypes and trait heritabilities (as used in Norsvin’s routine breeding value evaluation) are in Table . The data were analysed with single-trait animal models using statistical models that were the same as those used by Norsvin for their routine EBV estimation: where (for brevity  trait subscripts are omitted): <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects of farm-year with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed sex effects with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects of the version number of the method used to calculate meat percentage with design matrix ;  b denotes the regression of meat percentage on the weights of the animals  ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects of the parity of the mother with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed effects of month of birth with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of random Normal independently distributed litter effects with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of random NIID distributed pen effects with design matrix ; <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of random normally distributed animal effect with design matrix  and V() = s  where  is the relationship matrix calculated by method x (see below for the methods used). Variance components of the random effects were previously estimated in a large Norsvin dataset for regular breeding value estimation using pedigree relationships (see Table )  and were used as known input parameters in the current study. Thus  the variance of the animal effect was assumed constant and did not depend on the relationship matrix used. The analyses were performed by ASREML []  using the BLUP option. The alternative methods used for the breeding value estimation are explained below:  the numerator relationship matrix  (and its inverse) was set up based on pedigree relationships []. : following Luan et al. []  linkage analysis was used to calculate a relationship matrix  at every marker position j  which were then averaged over all marker positions j to arrive at the final  matrix. The  matrices were set up using the approach of Fernando and Grossman [] based on the segregation probabilities  i.e. the probability of inheriting a paternally or maternally derived allele. The latter probabilities were estimated by the LDMIP software []. Computationally   is the most demanding of the  matrices. After running LDMIP  it was necessary to set up a gametic relationship matrix at all positions  j  which requires four times as much computer resources per position than setting up . Calculation of the 38 453  matrices was parallelised  but computer memory demands increased linearly with the number of  matrices that were calculated in parallel  which may limit the degree of parallelisation of the computations. : The relationship matrix  was constructed using the approach of []: where  is a matrix of standardised genotypes  with element <U+2009>=<U+2009>-2 and  being the number of “1” alleles that animal  carries for SNP . The LDMIP program [] was used to estimate genotype probabilities for the ungenotyped animals. These genotype probabilities were used to estimate  in the case of missing genotypes. Because the genotyped animals cannot predict the genotypes of the ungenotyped animals with certainty  a residual relationship matrix    must be accounted for  i.e. the relationships of the ungenotyped animals given the genotyped animals [  ]. Following []  this residual relationship matrix was calculated using  instead of   .  = <U+2009>-<U+2009>  where subscript 2 (1) denotes the (un)genotyped block of animals. This R matrix was added to the elements of G pertaining to the ungenotyped animals to arrive at the final matrix: . : Haplotype alleles were set up following a suggestion by Mike Goddard (personal communication): starting at SNP position j<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  Step 1: set j<U+2009>=<U+2009>j<U+2009>+<U+2009>1 and include SNP j into the haplotype (which is relatively easy since the genotypes were phased by Beagle); repeat this step until the number of haplotype alleles exceeds a fixed number (we used 10); Step 2: output the detected haplotype alleles  and go back to Step 1 to set up the haplotypes for the next segment until the entire chromosome is processed. In contrast to the usual methods for setting up haplotypes  in which haplotype boundaries are pre-set  here the boundaries occur at positions where the number of haplotype alleles expands and exceeds the maximum of 10. When extending the size of the haplotype  a large increase in number of haplotype alleles suggests that we are no longer handling a single haplotype but a combination of two adjacent haplotypes  i.e. such positions form a natural place for a haplotype boundary. The total number of haplotypes formed by this method was 54 303. In order to analyse these haplotypes by the SNP-based methods and software  the haplotypes were translated into SNPs in the following way. If a haplotype at a particular position had four alleles A  B  C and D  this was translated into four ‘artificial’ SNPs where SNP1 has allele ‘1’ when haplotype A occurred and otherwise ‘0’<U+2009>  SNP2 has allele ‘1’ when haplotype B occurred and otherwise ‘0’<U+2009>  SNP3 had allele ‘1’ when haplotype C occurred  etc. The recombination rate between these four artificial SNPs was assumed to be very small (10). In order to obtain predictions of haplotype alleles for ungenotyped animals  the haplotypes were analysed by LDMIP. Next  the artificial SNP genotypes were translated into a relationship matrix    following the same procedure as used for GBLUP  to which the same  matrix as for GBLUP was added for the ungenotyped animals to arrive at the final matrix . In order to assess the accuracy of GS  the phenotypic records of the youngest animals born after September 2012 were masked in the analyses  i.e. their phenotypes were set to missing. See Table  for the numbers of masked records. Next  these records were predicted using the estimates of the effects in the model. The squared correlation    between the predicted and real phenotypic records was calculated and interpreted in terms of explained variance of the records  i.e. a fraction  of the variance of the records could be explained and the unexplained fraction was (1-). Similar to how SAS (SAS Institute  Cary NC) interprets the (un)explained sum of squares relative to a model that includes only an overall mean  we interpreted the (un)explained variance relative to a model that includes all non-genetic effects  i.e. all effects except the animal effect. If the fraction of the explained variance achieved by a model including only non-genetic effects is denoted by   the extra variance explained by the animal effect in model x    was obtained from: i.e.  the total variance reduction is the product of the variance reduction from the non-genetic model and the variance reduction due to fitting the animal effect. Since the animal effect cannot explain the environmental variance  the maximum variance reduction is (1<U+2009>-<U+2009>) = /()  where  is from Table   and V() is the variance of the masked records. Using equation ()  this variance reduction was put relative to a model that already contains all non-genetic effects  resulting in . Note that  is probably over-estimated because its derivation assumed that not only the animal effects are predicted with an accuracy of 1  but also all other non-genetic effects. Finally  the accuracy of the prediction of the animal effects using model x  i.e. the correlation between predicted and true values  was calculated as  = /  which is expected to be underestimated because of the over-estimation of . The increase in the accuracy of prediction when using a more sophisticated relationship matrix was tested for its statistical significance. A more powerful test can be devised than just considering the standard errors of correlation estimates (which tests whether any two correlation estimates differ)  since all correlation estimates were based on the same set of phenotypes. Let   and   denote the recorded phenotype value  its prediction using method 1  and its prediction using method 2 for record   then the correlations between   and   were estimated using the model: where [  ]<U+2009>‘denotes the mean  and []’ denotes the residuals  which were assumed to have (co)variance matrix: where all variances and correlations were estimated by ASREML []  together with the log likelood of this alternative-hypothesis model  . In the null-hypothesis model  the correlation between y and  was assumed equal to that between y and   i.e. the restriction was <U+2009>=<U+2009>  which resulted in the likelihood of the null model: . Under the null-hypothesis  2(- ) is approximately chi-squared distributed with one degree of freedom. The resulting P values were halved here because a one-sided test was performed (a priori one of the methods was assumed superior  and if the data did not support this assumption  the test was always considered not-significant). This significance test was applied within one cohort of the youngest animals using another (older) cohort of training animals  and thus does not account for extra variability  e.g. due to different relationships between animals  that occurs if the design would have been replicated. Table  shows the relationships between the off-diagonal elements of the relationship matrices  since the off-diagonals are most important for the accuracy of breeding value prediction. The variances of the relationships increase as we go from  to  to  to   where  shows 2.3 fold the variance of . This is expected as the relationship matrices make an increasing use of the marker data in this order. The regression coefficient of  on  is equal to 1.001  which is expected since both are known to be unbiased estimators of relationships. For the regressions of  and  on   the regression coefficients are slightly smaller than 1  showing that genetic differences picked up by  are also reflected in  and   with only minor scaling differences (however the regression of  on  is less than 1 and differences in genomic relationships are not fully reflected in ). These minor scaling differences suggest that the use of the same animal variance for all  matrices is justified. The regression of  and  on  are similar to those on . Correlations between the relationships can be as low as 0.6  which shows that pedigree and genomic relationships are quite different; correlations are lower than those found in dairy cattle []. The correlations between the elements of  and  are high (0.94). Table  shows the raw correlations  <U+03C1>  between the masked records and their predicted values using the alternative relationship matrices. Generally  there is a substantial improvement in accuracies when moving from the  matrix to genomic relationship matrices. Although the improvement due to the implementation of the linkage analysis matrix    is more moderate  it is statistically significant. Moving from  to  yields in most cases a clear and significant improvement. There is a tendency for the  matrix to improve the accuracies for two (GR and M%) of the four traits analyzed  but these differences are not significant. It is notable that prediction accuracies are lowest for growth  despite its quite high heritability. This is probably because growth has historically been a major part of the breeding goal  which reduces the between-family genetic variance for this trait  and the between-family component is easier to predict than the within-family (Mendelian sampling) component. Table  shows the accuracies of selection    for the alternative relationship matrices. Apart from growth (which is commented above)  the genomic selection accuracies range from 0.3 to 0.65  which are quite high  especially when considering the fact that candidates have masked phenotypes  the number of genotyped animals is low and the data consist of phenotypic records instead of accurate deregressed proofs. The pattern of the accuracies is similar to that for the correlations in Table . For W3W  the accuracy of traditional selection is quite high and is relatively not much improved by genomic selection. Possibly the assumption that W3W is determined only by the genetics of the piglet is not valid  in that the genetics of the mother may also play an important role  but the genotype of the dam was unknown in the current analysis. The  matrix yields substantially less accuracy than the IBS-based relationship matrices. Genomic selection may be seen as a form of traditional BLUP selection where the pedigree relationship matrix    is substituted by a (more accurate) genomic relationship matrix. Our hypothesis was that genomic relationship matrices based on the IBS of single SNPs may put the base population too far back in time  especially because the SNP panels are often selected for high MAF. Identities at QTL alleles may be due to more recent common ancestors because natural and artificial selection may have eroded ancient genetic differences. The results in Table  suggest that we have succeeded in creating relationship matrices that increasingly consider old relationships in the order      and   since the variance of relationships increases in this order  probably due to considering more old relationships. These more variable relationships are real in the sense that the regression on younger relationships is close to 1 and they result in higher prediction accuracies. Although  there was a tendency for the haplotype-based relationship matrix    to yield higher prediction accuracy than the single-marker based matrix  (for two of four traits)  these results were not statistically significant. Interestingly  the traits for which  tended to yield higher accuracy than  (GR and M%) are more heavily selected in pig breeding than the other traits (W3W and NT)  suggesting that the use of more recent relationship matrices than  is beneficial for more heavily selected traits. However  the  and  matrices apparently resulted in relationships that were too young. The  matrix was based on haplotypes with an average size of 8.4 SNPs (result not shown). With a median inter-marker distance of 28 kb [] and assuming a recombination rate of 1 cM per 1000 kb  the recombination rate over a 8.4 SNP region is <U+2009>˜<U+2009>0.0022  resulting in a base population that occurred approximately 1/(2)<U+2009>=<U+2009>223 generations ago []. The effective population size of Norwegian Landrace is about <U+2009>=<U+2009>100 (personal communication Dan Olsen  Norsvin  2013)  which yields an expected heterozygosity of the haplotypes of []: Since this expected heterozygosity is close to 50%  the information contained in the haplotypes is close to maximum. The use of larger haplotypes with a higher recombination frequency would not maximise the information contained in the haplotypes but would point to a quite recent common ancestor in the case of haplotype homozygosity  which would be useful when trying to trace young mutations (e.g. disease mutations). Setting the base population to about 200 generations ago agrees also with the history of modern European pig breeds  which originate from a hybridisation with Asian breeds in the 18 or early 19 century []. The linkage analysis matrix  yielded poorer prediction accuracies than the  matrix (Table )  which is contrary to the results reported for dairy cattle []. The poorer results of linkage analysis in pigs relative to dairy cattle may be because: (1) there was only about one generation of genotyped and phenotyped animals  leaving little opportunity for tracing chromosome segments from one generation to the next by linkage analysis; (2) the information content of phenotypic records is lower than that of deregressed proofs  which combined with the fact that linkage analysis requires re-estimation of chromosomal effects within families  results in a relatively low  for the pig data; (3) the porcine genome sequence map may not be as accurate as its bovine counterpart  which may have hampered the linkage analysis; (4) the  of the recent pig population may be larger than that of cattle  which implies that older ancestors and thus relationships are important; (5) the prediction of deregressed proofs in dairy cattle may not require such old relationships compared to prediction of phenotypic records  because deregressed proofs are themselves predicted by a linear model using only recent relationships; (6) the aforementioned hybridisation with Asian breeds [] will have caused considerable LD  which predates pedigree recording and thus is not captured by . Explanation (5) does  however  not explain the results in Table   where the correlations between the relationships in the  and  matrices are lower than found by [] in dairy cattle. In our view  explanations (1) and (2) are the most likely  also if one considers that the youngest animals that were predicted were rarely sibs of the phenotyped animals  due to the high turn-over rate of the elite boars in pig breeding. Moreover  dairy cattle results also indicated that several generations of linkage analysis are needed for high []. Several authors have attempted to fit haplotypes for genomic prediction [–]  mainly based on the argument that haplotypes may show stronger LD with QTL than single SNPs. Here  we used the argument that haplotypes trace younger relationships than the old relationships traced by single SNPs. However  these two arguments are equivalent  which is similar to the equivalence of SNP-BLUP genomic selection with GBLUP [  ]. Our results also agree with those of [–]  i.e. the use of haplotypes increases accuracy only sometimes and not by much. In machine-learning  prediction is viewed as striking a balance between bias and error variance []  where a model with strong (oversimplifying) assumptions is biased and a more realistic model fits too many effects and thus has large prediction error variances. Haplotype-based models may reflect the LD structure or the relevant age of the relationships better  but they usually fit more effects and  in a situation with limited numbers of training records  may not prove to be more accurate than GBLUP. The SNPs in GBLUP predict relationships over long genetic distances  which reduces the prediction error variance and increases bias but apparently not to the point that the haplotype models are clearly favoured. In the future  the numbers of genotyped animals will increase  which will reduce prediction error variances  and in sequence data  the number of haplotypes is lower than the number of SNPs. All this will favour models that fit haplotype effects. Deregressed proofs (but the same holds for daughter-yield-deviations or other estimates that more accurately reflect the genetics of an animal than a phenotypic record) are derived from a linear model including the masked and unmasked records. If we write the deregressed proof as DP<U+2009>=<U+2009>TBV<U+2009>+<U+2009>ERR  where TBV is true breeding value  the error term  ERR  is partly due to unmasked records in the training data  and thus can be predicted by the genomic selection model (especially when it is similar to the model that was used to calculate the DP). Hence  when predicting masked DP  predicted accuracies of GS are biased because where GEBV denotes genomic breeding value estimates. I.e. the second term inflates the covariance between GEBV and masked DP above that due to prediction of TBV by GEBV (assuming that the errors of the GEBV are positively correlated with the errors from the model that predicts the DP). In this study  we predicted masked phenotypic records. Errors in phenotypic records  i.e.  the environmental effects  cannot be predicted by genomic selection  and thus a high accuracy of prediction of records can only be achieved by a high accuracy of prediction of TBV. Thus  when predicting masked phenotypes  the predicted accuracies are not expected to be biased  in contrast to the use of DP or daughter-yield-deviations. Especially for the analyses of W3W and NT  the data included many phenotypic records on non-genotyped animals (Table ). Genomic prediction analyses for such data are usually performed by the so-called one-step approach [  ]. We used an alternative approach here  because of bias problems with the one-step approach [  ]. For instance  a relationship of 0.55 between full sibs can be explained by linkage analysis  i.e. the sibs happened to inherit more chromosome segments in common from their parents than expected. However the one-step approach explains such increased relationships between family members by adapting the relationships between the founder animals. The latter is because it leaves the regression of ungenotyped onto genotyped animals unaltered (in contrast to linkage analysis). The use of relationship matrix  instead of  solves this problem  because in the  matrix these regressions are altered by the marker information []. Following []  we used the estimated genotype probabilities to calculate relationships of ungenotyped animals. In contrast to the one-step approach  this does not require quantification of the difference between a  and  matrix (also not on the inverse scale)  and this avoids scaling problems associated with the one-step approach (e.g. []; although the    and  matrices had quite similar scales here; see Table ). Matrix  was added to account for unexplained relationships  but this increased the accuracy of prediction of records only by up to 0.01 (result not shown). The largest increase was for NT  which had most phenotypes recorded on ungenotyped animals. In the future  it is expected that a small minority of phenotypes will come from ungenotyped ancestors  which may make the computationally demanding calculation of the  matrix redundant. This will probably require that the diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix are calculated by the method of [] because otherwise they systematically fall below 1 for ungenotyped animals. For ungenotyped descendants of genotyped animals  the one-step method can and should be used  since it is unbiased and optimal for such animals [].

A model that included a polygenic effect did not recover the loss of prediction accuracy from exclusion of X chromosome markers. The results from this study suggest that markers on the X chromosome contribute to accuracy of genomic predictions and should be used for routine genomic evaluation. According to the UMD 3.1 assembly  chromosome X is the second largest chromosome in the bovine genome []. A total of 1128 annotated genes have been reported on the X chromosome in the ENSEMBL version 72 []. However  markers on the X chromosome are not used for genomic prediction in some countries and populations. Previously  Nordic genomic evaluations used X chromosome markers for genomic predictions in Nordic Red and Jersey populations but not in the Holstein population because markers on the X chromosome were not included in the EuroGenomics project []. In mammals  inheritance of chromosome X differs from inheritance of autosomes. In cattle  a sire passes its X chromosome to all its daughters but never to its sons. Consequently  a male inherits a copy of the X chromosome from its mother only  while a female inherits one copy of the X chromosome from its father and one copy from its mother. Therefore  the relationships caused by the X chromosome are different for males and females. Furthermore  a small region of the X chromosome  called the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) is homologous to the Y chromosome and is inherited in an autosome-like fashion. This increases the complexity of the genetic relationships between individuals based on the X chromosome. Moreover  in genomic prediction of dairy cattle  deregressed proofs (DRP)  daughter yield deviations (DYD) and estimated breeding values (EBV) are usually used as response variables. These variables are predicted using a model in which a pedigree-based relationship matrix is constructed based on inheritance of autosomes. In addition  the density of markers on the X chromosome is markedly lower than that on the autosomes in the current SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chips [  ]. These characteristics may reduce the impact of X chromosome markers on accuracy of genomic prediction  and could be the reason why they are not used for genomic prediction in some countries and populations. Based on the characteristics of the X chromosome  it can be hypothesized that X chromosome markers can contribute to the accuracy of genomic predictions  but will generally have a smaller impact than autosomal markers. Moreover  genomic prediction using a genomic relationship matrix that takes sex-linked inheritance for X-specific markers into account will probably perform better than using a genomic relationship matrix that does not distinguish between autosomal and X-specific markers. In addition  because marker density is lower on the X chromosome  imputation of X chromosome markers may be less accurate than that of autosomal markers. When genomic predictions are performed using data from SNP chips with different densities  genotypes of SNPs absent from low-density chips are usually inferred (imputed) from the higher density chips. Therefore  it is necessary to investigate the accuracy of imputation of markers on the X chromosome in order to perform genomic prediction using these markers. However  so far there are very few reports on the imputation accuracy of X chromosome markers [] and on their contribution to accuracy of genomic predictions []. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the accuracy of imputing missing genotypes on the X chromosome  (ii) to demonstrate a method to calculate a genomic relationship matrix which correctly accounts for genetic relationships with regard to markers on the X chromosome  and (iii) to compare the accuracy of genomic predictions with and without X chromosome information using different models and different scenarios. Data from Nordic Holstein cattle were used to address these objectives. The data used in this analysis consisted of 5643 progeny-tested Nordic Holstein bulls born from 1974 to 2010. The data did not include cows since the number of Nordic Holstein cows available as reference animals was insufficient for the present analysis. Animals were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip []. In order to investigate the accuracy of imputation for markers on the X chromosome  low-density (LD) marker data were created from the SNP50 BeadChip marker data by masking markers that are absent from the Illumina BovineLD BeadChip []. The Bovine SNP50 BeadChip (about 54K) and the BovineLD BeadChip (about 7K) marker data were edited by removing markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.01  an average GenCall score lower than 0.60  or an unknown location in UMD 3.1 []. After editing  44 141 markers remained in the 54K data  and 6699 markers in the LD data. The numbers of markers available on the autosomes and on the X chromosome are in Table . The bulls were divided into a reference population and a test population according to birth date  i.e.  3995 bulls born before January 1 2005 constituted the reference population and the remaining 1648 bulls constituted the test population. Four sets of data were used to validate accuracies of genotype imputation and genomic prediction: (1) 54K_real: all animals had marker data from the 54K chip; (2) IMP_test: for the test animals  the 54K marker data were imputed from LD marker data; (3) IMP_0.5ref: for half (randomly chosen) of the reference animals  the 54K marker data were imputed from LD marker data  and (4) LD_real: all animals had LD marker data without imputation to the 54K marker data. The phenotypic data for genomic prediction were DRP that were derived from the Nordic genetic evaluations of January 2013. Fifteen traits included in the Nordic Total Merit index () were analyzed. DRP with reliabilities lower than 10% for animals in the reference data and lower than 20% for animals in the test data were deleted. The number of animals with phenotypic information differed between traits because the number of bulls with published EBV differed between traits. The number of animals available for genomic prediction and the heritability (provided by Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation) for each trait are in Table . For datasets IMP_test and IMP_0.5ref  the LD marker data were imputed to the 54K data using two programs: Beagle version 3.3.1 [] and Findhap version 2 []. Beagle uses population information and a hidden Markov model to impute missing genotypes. Findhap is a fast program that imputes missing genotypes using both family and population information and takes the inheritance pattern of the X chromosome into account. Therefore  when using Findhap  markers on the PAR of the X chromosome were treated as autosomal markers  while the rest were treated as X-specific markers. The PAR was approximately identified based on the region of the X chromosome where markers had a substantial proportion of heterozygous genotypes (H%) in the genotyped bulls. The starting position of the region was determined with the criteria that the H% at a SNP was higher than 5%  and at least five of the following 10 SNPs with a MAF larger than 0.05 had a H% higher than 5%. The PAR stopped at the end of the X chromosome. For datasets 54K_real and LD_real  sporadic missing genotypes (4%) were imputed using Beagle. Genotypes for the imputed markers (in datasets IMP_test and IMP_0.5ref) were compared to their corresponding real genotypes in 54K_real. Accuracy of imputation was measured by the ratio of the number of falsely imputed alleles to total number of imputed alleles  which will be referred to as allele error rate and the ratio of the number of falsely imputed genotypes to the total number of imputed genotypes  which will be referred to as genotype error rate  as well as the correlation between imputed and true genotypes. As presented by VanRaden [] and Hayes et al. []  a genomic relationship matrix () can be calculated as: where elements in column  () of  are 0 - 2  1 - 2 and 2 - 2 for SNP genotypes AA  AA and AA  respectively   is the frequency of allele A at SNP . The  matrix is calculated based on identity by state (IBS)  with centering and scaling. Consequently  elements of the  matrix are approximations of realized proportions of the genome that are identical by descent (IBD) between pairs of individuals []  which makes the  matrix analogous to the conventional numerator relationship matrix []. The  matrix describes the realized genetic relationships between pairs of individuals at the autosomal markers. However  genetic relationships between individuals at markers on the sex chromosomes and the autosomes are different. For example  for markers on the X-specific region of the X chromosome  the genetic relationship is 0 between father and son   between mother and son and between father and daughter  0.50 between mother and daughter and between full brothers  0.75 between full sisters  and  between full brother and sister. For autosomal loci  these relationships all have an expectation of 0.50. Therefore  sex-linked inheritance should be considered when building a genomic relationship matrix based on marker data that include X chromosome markers. When X-specific markers are treated as autosomal markers  the resulting genomic relationship matrix reflects sex-linked relationships  but on an incorrect scale because males have one X chromosome while females have two. For example  the relationship between sire and son is 0  but the diagonal element for a male is 2  instead of 1. Consequently  the covariance structures for males  for females  and between males and females differ from each other. Let AO and AO denote genotypes of an X-specific marker in males (O means null  since males have only one X chromosome)  and AA  AA and AA denote genotypes in females. Assuming that AO in males has the same effect on the performance of a trait as AA in females  genotypes of an X-specific marker can be coded in the same way as autosomal markers. Thus  genotypes AO and AO of males are coded as 0 and 2  and genotypes AA  AA and AA of females are coded as 0  1 and 2. In addition  define <U+03B3> as the effect of A (i.e.  allele effect on performance of a trait is expressed as the deviation from the effect of A1  thus the effect of A1 is zero)   as the frequency of A and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1-. The expectation of the genetic value () accounted for by an X-specific marker for a male is: Let  be the genotype code as defined above and assume that the allele effect is independent of allele frequency and is additive (i.e.  absence of non-additive genetic effect)  then the variance of genetic value () at an X-specific locus in the population of males is: where  is the variance of the random additive allele effect . For females  the expectation and variance are the same as those for autosomal markers  i.e. and Let  be the element of matrix  for individual  and marker   as defined previously. The relationship coefficient between male  and male  caused by the X-specific marker  can then be calculated as: The relationship coefficient between female  and female  has the same form as for autosomal markers  i.e. The relationship coefficient between male  and female  is: Alternatively  it can be assumed that genotype AO in males has half the effect of genotype AA in females. Then  the genotypes can be coded as the number of copies of A  i.e.  0 and 1 for genotypes AO and AO of males  0  1 and 2 for genotypes AA  AA and AA of females  respectively. For females  the expectation and variance accounted for by an X-specific marker are the same as the above. The expectation of the genetic value for a male is: and the variance of the genetic value for males is: Let  be the element for individual  and marker  in the corresponding  matrix. Define <U+2009>=<U+2009>0- for genotype AO and <U+2009>=<U+2009>1- for genotype AO of males  and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0-2  1-2 or 2-2 for genotypes AA  AA  or AA of females. Then  <U+2009>=<U+2009>/2 for males  and <U+2009>=<U+2009> for females. Then  the relationship coefficient between male  and male  caused by the X-specific marker  is: the relationship coefficient between female  and female  is: and the relationship coefficient between male  and female  is: This demonstrates that the two alternate assumptions for the effect of the male genotype of X-specific markers lead to the same relationship coefficient. Thus  the  matrix based on both autosomal and X chromosome markers can be calculated as for autosomal markers  but element  of the  matrix must be divided by  if marker  is a X-specific marker and individual  is a male  i.e. where ° is the Hadamard product operation  element  in vector  is 1 if individual  is a female  and  if individual  is a male. To construct the  matrix  when the codes for AA  AA and AA are 0  1 and 2  the X-specific genotypes of AO and AO are coded as 0 and 2. Genomic predictions based on marker data with and without markers on the X chromosome were carried out using the following GBLUP models implemented in the DMU package []: (1) G(A): GBLUP with the  matrix built using autosomal markers ( ) only:  (2) G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X): GBLUP with the  matrix built using all markers and treating X-specific markers as autosomal markers ( ):  (3) G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X): GBLUP with the  matrix built using all markers and accounting for the sex-linked inheritance of X-specific markers ( )   (4) G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X): GBLUP using both the autosomal  matrix and the X chromosome  matrix ( ):  (5) G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol: model G(A) plus a residual polygenic effect:  (6) G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol: model G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) plus a residual polygenic effect:  In the above models   is the vector of DRP  µ is the intercept   is the vector of genomic breeding values accounted for by autosomes   is the vector of genomic breeding values accounted for by the X chromosome   is the vector of total genomic breeding values associated with the  matrix that treats X-specific markers as autosomal markers   is the vector of total genomic breeding values associated with the  matrix that accounts for X-specific markers as sex-linked markers   is the incidence matrix relating genomic breeding values to    is the vector of residual polygenic effects   is the incidence matrix that associates  with   and  is the vector of random residuals. Random effects are assumed distributed as follows: where  is the pedigree-based relationship matrix  and  is a diagonal matrix used to account for heterogeneous residual variances due to different reliabilities of DRP (). The diagonal element  of matrix  was computed as . Reliability of DRP was calculated as  where EDC is the equivalent daughter contribution and []. All variances ( and ) were estimated from the DRP data used in the analyses  using the corresponding models. The allele frequencies used to construct the  matrix were calculated from the current marker data of the genotyped animals. In addition to the above analyses  genomic predictions were also performed using four reduced 54K marker datasets. These datasets were: (1) Non-2: marker data excluding the markers on chromosome 2 that has a length similar to that of the X chromosome; (2) Non-10: marker data excluding the markers on chromosome 10 which is similar to the X chromosome in terms of number of annotated genes; (3) Non-26: marker data excluding the markers on chromosome 26 which is similar to X chromosome in terms of number of markers; (4) Non-ran: marker data excluding a random sample of 827 markers (equivalent to the number of markers available on the X chromosome). Genomic predictions based on these datasets were carried out using the GBLUP model <U+2009>=<U+2009>µ<U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>   where  is the vector of genomic breeding values accounted for by the reduced marker data. The  matrix used for the analyses considered sex-linked inheritance for X-specific markers. Genomic predictions using different marker datasets and different models were validated by comparing genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) and DRP for animals in the test data. GEBV were calculated as the sum of the genomic effect and the residual polygenic effect for models G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol  and as the sum of the autosomal effect and the X chromosome effect for model G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X). Reliabilities of genomic predictions were estimated as the squared correlation between genomic predictions and DRP  and then divided by the average reliability of DRP  based on []: where TBV is true breeding value. Bias of genomic predictions was assessed by regression of DRP on GEBV []. A necessary condition for unbiased prediction is that the regression coefficient does not deviate significantly from 1. The log-likelihood ratio statistic (-2lnLR) was used to test the difference in goodness of fit between model G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X) and model G(A)  and between model G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol and model G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X). Taking G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol as alternative model while G(A) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) as null model  the log-likelihood ratio statistic was calculated as -2lnLR<U+2009>=<U+2009>-2ln(likelihood of null model/likelihood of alternative model). The P value of -2lnLR was calculated assuming that -2lnLR is asymptotically  distributed []  and calculated assuming that the asymptotic distribution of -2lnLR is a 50:50 mixture of  and  so that P(-)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5P () []. Hotelling-Williams’ t-test [  ] was implemented to test the equality of two dependent correlations (Cor(GEBV  DRP)) from two models for the same trait. The log-likelihood ratio test and Hotelling-Williams’ t-test were implemented in the analysis using the 54K_real marker data . The accuracy of imputation from the 7K to the 54K SNP panel was high (Table ). Using Beagle  the allele error rate for autosomal markers averaged over the two datasets (IMP_test and IMP_0.5ref) was 1.1%. Compared with autosomal markers  the allele error rates for X-specific markers and PAR markers were increased by 2.1 and 7.7%  respectively. The accuracy of imputation with Findhap was slightly lower than that with Beagle  with an increase of the allele error rate of about 0.7% for autosomes  0.3% for X-specific markers  and 1.5% for PAR markers  averaged over the two datasets. Correlation coefficients between imputed and true genotypes for autosomal markers  pseudo-autosomal markers  and X-specific markers were 0.983  0.856 and 0.937 with Beagle  and 0.971  0.831 and 0.935 with Finhap. Genotype error rate was nearly twice as large as the allele error rate for markers on autosomes and PAR  but almost the same for X-specific markers (Table ). This was because animals in the present data were all bulls  thus genotype error was in principle equivalent to the allele error for X-specific markers. The reason for a slightly higher genotype error rate than allele error rate for X-specific markers was that some genotypes were heterozygous in the real 54K data (due to typing error) and in the imputed data (due to imputation error). Although animals with LD genotypes in the IMP_test dataset had more ancestors with 54K genotypes  while animals with LD genotypes in the IMP_0.5ref dataset had more progeny with 54K genotypes  these two datasets had similar accuracies of imputation (Table ). Allele error rates were equal to 1.9% with Findhap and 1.2% with Beagle  averaged over the two imputation datasets and calculated from the data pooled over the autosomes and the X chromosome markers. As shown in Table   for the four datasets  genomic predictions using all markers gave a slightly higher reliability than predictions without markers on the X chromosome. Averaged over the 15 traits  the gain in reliability from using the X chromosome markers was 0.4 to 0.5% points when using models without a residual polygenic effect  and 0.3 to 0.4% points when using models with a residual polygenic effect. Models G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) resulted in the same reliability of genomic predictions  which indicates that a  matrix that took sex-linked inheritance for X-specific markers into account did not improve genomic prediction more than a  matrix that dealt with X-specific markers as autosomal markers  possibly because animals in the present data were all bulls. In addition  model G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X) did not improve predictions compared to models G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)  which suggests that it is reasonable to assume that the effects of the markers on the X chromosome and the autosomes have the same distribution. A model that included a residual polygenic effect improved the reliability of predicted breeding values  with an average increase of about 0.8% points (Table ). For all scenarios  the greatest improvement in reliability by including a residual polygenic effect in the model was observed for the traits longevity and other diseases. Reliability of GEBV using the LD genotypes was 5% points lower than when using the real 54K genotypes and applying models without a polygenic effect  and 3.4% points lower when applying models with a polygenic effect. Furthermore  genomic predictions based on the imputed datasets of IMP_test and IMP_0.5ref were almost as accurate as predictions based on the real 54K data. Regression coefficients of DRP on genomic predictions based on the real 54K or imputed 54K genotype data ranged from 0.782 to 1.064  except for longevity  for which the regression coefficients ranged from 0.631 to 0.685 (Table ). Averaged over the 15 traits  the regression coefficients were slightly closer to 1 with than without using the X chromosome markers for prediction. Regression coefficients were the same when using real versus imputed 54K genotype data. In addition  models that included a residual polygenic effect resulted in regression coefficients considerably closer to 1 than models without a polygenic effect  which indicates a reduction of prediction bias from including polygenic effects. Regression coefficients deviated more from 1 for genomic predictions based on LD genotype data than for predictions using the 54K genotype data  which indicates a larger prediction bias for the former. However  when using models with a residual polygenic effect  the regression coefficients based on LD genotypes were very close to those based on the 54K genotype data. Table  shows the reliability of genomic predictions when excluding one of four selected chromosomes or when deleting a random sample of markers. Compared to excluding the X chromosome  excluding chromosome 2 (similar to the X chromosome in length)  chromosome 10 (similar to the X chromosome in number of annotated genes)  and chromosome 26 (similar to the X chromosome in number of markers) led to larger losses in reliability. Excluding chromosome 10 led to the largest loss in reliability  while randomly deleting 827 markers (i.e. the same number of markers as on the X chromosome) led to no loss in reliability. The log likelihood ratio test statistics in Table  indicate that model (G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X)) using both autosomal and X chromosome markers had a significantly better goodness of fit than model (G(A)) using only autosomal markers for 13 of the 15 traits  and that model (G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol) with a residual polygenic effect was significantly better than model (G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)) without a polygenic effect for 12 traits. As shown in Table   the variance accounted for by the X chromosome was significantly different from 0 for 10 traits  and the variance accounted for by the residual polygenic effect was significant for 13 traits. On average  the X chromosome accounted for 1.7% of the total additive genetic variance  and the residual polygenic effect for 17.2% of the total additive genetic variance. Table  presents reliabilities of genomic predictions for each trait using models G(A)  G(A)<U+2009>+<U+2009>G(X) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Pol  based on the 54K_real dataset and shows that the contribution of X chromosome markers to the reliability of genomic predictions differed between traits. An increase in reliability of around 2% points was observed for fertility and other diseases. Correspondingly  the variances explained by the X chromosome were much higher for these two traits than for the other traits. Longevity also showed a significant benefit of including X chromosome markers  although the variance accounted for by the X chromosome was small for this trait. Averaged over the 15 traits  including the X chromosome improved the prediction reliability by 0.5% points. The benefit of including polygenic effects into the model also differed among traits (Table ). A significant increase in the reliability of genomic predictions from including a residual polygenic effect was obtained for four traits. The largest improvements were for longevity (3.6%) and other diseases (3.7%). For these two traits  the variance accounted for by residual polygenic effect was more than 40% of the total additive genetic variance (Table ). For the other traits  the average improvement in prediction reliability was 0.3%. This study investigated the accuracy of genotype imputation for markers on the X chromosome and the impact of including X chromosome markers on reliability of genomic predictions. The results showed that averaged over the 15 traits evaluated  including X chromosome markers improved the reliability of genomic prediction slightly  ranging from 0.3 to 0.5% points in various datasets and using different models. The variance accounted for by the X chromosome was about 1.7% of the total additive genetic variance. Gains in reliability from including the X chromosome were smaller than observed in a previous study on USA Holstein cattle by VanRaden et al. []  who reported an increase in reliability of 1.5%  averaged over nine traits  although the X chromosome accounted for only 1% of the total genetic variance in their study. When the genomic model included a residual polygenic effect  breeding values predicted using marker data that included X chromosome markers were still more accurate than those predicted without X chromosome markers. This means that a model that includes a residual polygenic effect does not recover the loss of prediction accuracy from exclusion of X chromosome markers. The loss of prediction accuracy from exclusion of the X chromosome was smaller than when an autosome of similar size (chromosome 2)  or with an equivalent number of annotated genes (chromosome 10)  or with an equivalent number of markers (chromosome 26) was excluded. There are two possible reasons why markers on the X chromosome contribute less to the reliability of genomic predictions than these three autosomes. One reason is that the density of markers on the X chromosome is much lower than that on autosomes; the average distance between adjacent markers is about 180 kb on the X chromosome and 60 kb on the autosomes in the 54K marker data. The second reason is that markers on the X chromosome represent weaker relationships between individuals in the present data  which consisted only of males. The impact of genetic relationships between animals in the reference and test datasets on reliability of genomic predictions for test animals has been reported in many previous studies [  –]. Since the relationship between sires and sons is 0 for the X chromosome  information of a sire does not directly influence the son’s GEBV explained by the X chromosome. On the contrary  information of a sire directly influences the son’s GEBV explained by the autosomes  as reported in previous studies that showed that reliability of GEBV is about 5 to 10% higher for the test animals with than without their sires in the reference population [  ]. When a random set of 827 markers (i.e. the number of markers on the X chromosome) was excluded from the analysis  there was no loss in reliability of genomic prediction. This is explained by the fact that the effects of the removed markers are in part accounted for by other markers that are in linkage disequilibrium with the removed markers. Therefore  the loss in prediction reliability from removing a set of randomly chosen markers should be much smaller than the loss caused by removing an entire chromosome. In other words  if removing an entire chromosome leads to a larger loss in prediction reliability than removing a set of randomly chosen markers  this chromosome contributes to the reliability of genomic prediction due to linkage disequilibrium between the markers and causative genes on this chromosome. Thus  the fact that we observed a loss in prediction reliability when removing the X chromosome markers but not when removing 827 randomly chosen markers confirms that markers on the X chromosome are in linkage disequilibrium with causative genes on that chromosome which affect the traits studied. A  matrix that takes the sex-linked inheritance for X-specific markers into account is expected to improve genomic prediction when using X chromosome markers  compared to a  matrix that deals with X-specific markers as autosomal markers. However  models G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) and G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) gave the same reliability of genomic predictions  though the  matrix in model G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) took the sex-linked inheritance for X-specific markers into account while the  matrix in model G(A<U+2009>+<U+2009>X) did not. One reason for this result could be that the number of X-specific markers was too small to obtain a clear improvement in genomic predictions by correctly taking the sex-linked inheritance into account when calculating the  matrix. Another reason is that all animals in the current data were males  for which ignoring sex-linked inheritance in the calculation of the  matrix could have a small impact on relationship coefficients. Currently  in many countries and cattle populations  a large number of females are genotyped to increase the size of the reference population or to obtain their GEBV [  ]. When genomic data that include information from males and females and the markers on the X chromosome are used  a  matrix that appropriately accounts for sex-linked relationships is expected to be important for genomic prediction using the GBLUP model. Reliabilities of genomic predictions based on the imputed datasets of IMP_test and IMP_0.5ref were similar to those of predictions based on the real 54K data. This result is inconsistent with previous studies on genomic predictions using imputed 54K genotype data from a 3K marker panel in Nordic and French [] and German Holstein populations []  in which  on average  each 1% of imputation allele error rate resulted in a loss in prediction reliability of 1.3% points. The lower loss in reliability in our study could be due to the fact that the density of the LD chip (7K) used here was twice that of the 3K chip. Even when using the 7K genotype data without imputation  the reliability of genomic predictions was only 5.0% points lower than the reliability of predictions using the real 54K genotype data. Thus  an allele error rate of 1.2% in imputation from the 7K to the 54K marker data may have very little influence on the reliability of genomic predictions. Similarly  a previous study (Peipei Ma et al.  personal communication) investigated the impact of imputation from the 54K to the 777K SNP panel by using a combined 777K reference population and reported that an improvement of the imputation error rate by about 2% did not result in a corresponding improvement in the reliability of genomic predictions. These results suggest that the impact of imputation accuracy on genomic prediction not only depends on imputation accuracy  but also on the number of markers in the lower density panel. A model that included a residual polygenic effect increased the reliability of genomic predictions by 0.8% points on average across the 15 traits. This was larger than the 0.3% point increase reported by Gao et al. [] for the same population. However  the present study estimated residual polygenic variance for each trait  while in Gao et al. a constant ratio of residual polygenic variance to total additive genetic variance was used for all traits. The estimated ratios of residual polygenic variance to total additive genetic variance ranged from 0 to 53.4% among the 15 traits studied here. These results indicate that trait-specific weights on residual polygenic effects should be used in genomic prediction  instead of a constant weight across traits. Furthermore  a model that included a residual polygenic effect reduced prediction bias  which was in line with the results reported by Liu et al. [] and Gao et al. []. In practical genetic evaluations  GEBV are usually blended with the EBV from the conventional pedigree-based BLUP model. It is necessary to investigate whether the predicted genomic breeding values that include a residual polygenic effect result in double counting when blending them with traditional EBV. This could occur because the residual polygenic effect is already included in the GEBV  and the blending procedure uses the residual polygenic effect once again. Accuracy of imputation from the 7K to the 54K marker panel was high (allele error rate of 1.2% using Beagle)  which was in line with previous studies [  ]. Imputation accuracy was lower for markers on the X chromosome than for markers on autosomes  which is probably mainly due to the fact that the density of markers was lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. The average interval between adjacent markers on the X chromosome was three times as large as that on autosomes in the 54K data  and was nearly twice as large in the 7K data. Moreover  markers in the PAR had much lower imputation accuracy than X-specific markers  although the markers on the PAR were about twice as dense as X-specific markers in both the 7K and the 54K data. This can be explained by the fact that the PAR is a small segment (about 11 Mbp based on our estimation)  which could reduce imputation efficiency. Another explanation could be that X-specific markers may have lower recombination rates than PAR markers  since crossovers occur only in females. Poor imputation accuracy for PAR markers was also reported by Johnston et al. [] in the imputation from the 3K to the 54K panel. Although the accuracy of genotype imputation for markers on the X chromosome was lower than that for autosomal markers  the accuracy of imputation from the 7K to the 54K panel for markers on the X chromosome was still high in the Nordic Holstein population. Including markers on the X chromosome slightly increased the reliability of genomic predictions. Based on our data which included only bulls  using a  matrix that took the sex-linked inheritance of X-specific markers into account did not improve prediction compared to a  matrix that did not. Although the improvement in the reliability of genomic prediction obtained from the X chromosome is small  including X chromosome markers does not result in any extra cost. Therefore  it is recommended to use markers on the X chromosome for genomic evaluation.

However  to benefit from whole-genome sequence data  a large dataset of sequenced individuals is needed. Imputation from SNP panels  such as the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip and Illumina BovineHD BeadChip  to whole-genome sequence data is an attractive and less expensive approach to obtain whole-genome sequence genotypes for a large number of individuals than sequencing all individuals. Our objective was to investigate accuracy of imputation from lower density SNP panels to whole-genome sequence data in a typical dataset for cattle. Whole-genome sequence data of chromosome 1 (1737 471 SNPs) for 114 Holstein Friesian bulls were used. Beagle software was used for imputation from the BovineSNP50 (3132 SNPs) and BovineHD (40 492 SNPs) beadchips. Accuracy was calculated as the correlation between observed and imputed genotypes and assessed by five-fold cross-validation. Three scenarios S40  S60 and S80 with respectively 40%  60%  and 80% of the individuals as reference individuals were investigated. Mean accuracies of imputation per SNP from the BovineHD panel to sequence data and from the BovineSNP50 panel to sequence data for scenarios S40 and S80 ranged from 0.77 to 0.83 and from 0.37 to 0.46  respectively. Stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 to BovineHD panel and then to sequence data for scenario S40 improved accuracy per SNP to 0.65 but it varied considerably between SNPs. Accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence data was generally high for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip  but was low from the BovineSNP50 beadchip. Stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 to the BovineHD beadchip and then to sequence data substantially improved accuracy of imputation. SNPs with a low minor allele frequency were more difficult to impute correctly and the reliability of imputation varied more. Linkage disequilibrium between an imputed SNP and the SNP on the lower density panel  minor allele frequency of the imputed SNP and size of the reference group affected imputation reliability. One advantage of using whole-genome sequence data over genotypes from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) panels for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic prediction is that polymorphisms causing genetic differences can be included in whole-genome sequence data. Because the causative mutation is included  decay in linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a SNP and the causative mutation by recombination events is not an issue. Accordingly  testing variants directly associated with a given trait is possible and may lead to higher accuracy in GWAS and genomic predictions. Moreover  since there is no decay in LD when using sequence data compared to traditional smaller-sized marker panels  genomic selection across generations and across breeds may be improved e.g. [–]. Costs to generate whole-genome sequence data are decreasing rapidly. It is expected that  in the next few years  whole-genome sequence data will be widely available for crops and livestock  as is already the case for human studies []. Despite the fact that costs of sequencing are decreasing  it is still expensive to sequence large numbers of individuals. A less expensive approach to produce sequence genotypes for a large number of individuals is to impute from lower density marker panels to whole-genome sequence data. In this case  a core set of individuals is fully sequenced  and the lower density genotypes of the remaining individuals will be imputed to whole-genome sequence genotypes using the sequenced individuals as reference [–]. However  using sequence data may not lead to higher accuracy in genomic predictions and GWAS if the accuracy of imputation to sequence data is too low. Accuracy of imputation was studied in barley with 3200 SNPs []  in maize with 35 000 SNPs []  in sheep with 50 000 SNPs [] and in cattle with 50 000 SNPs e.g. [] and 777 000 SNPs e.g. []  among others. The general tendency in those studies was that the accuracy of imputation increased with an increasing number of SNPs on the lower density marker panel  a decreasing distance between the imputed SNP and the nearest SNP on the lower density marker panel  an increasing minor allele frequency (MAF) of imputed SNPs  an increasing level of LD (linkage disequilibrium)  and an increasing number of close relatives between imputed and reference individuals. In all those studies  imputation was done from low-density panels to higher density panels but not to whole-genome sequence data. In contrast to crops and livestock  human sequence data are available and accuracy of imputation to sequence data has been investigated e.g. [–]  which showed that accuracy of imputation was influenced by reference group composition (e.g. size or populations included)  number of markers on the lower density marker panel  and MAF of imputed SNPs. Moreover  according to Li []  these factors influenced accuracy of imputation especially in the case of SNPs with a MAF below 0.05. For imputation of SNPs with a MAF below 0.005  it was necessary that the reference group included at least 1200 individuals and for imputation of SNPs with a MAF between 0.005 and 0.05  only about 40% of the SNP genotypes were imputed with 1200 individuals in the reference group. Crop and livestock populations differ from human populations  in extent of LD and population structure [–]. In cattle  effective population size of some individual breeds has decreased rapidly to about 100 due to intense selection [–]. Consequently  LD in cattle breeds extends on relatively long distances. This is also true for many other domestic animal and plant populations (e.g. dogs or barley)  but not for human populations [  ]. When using whole-genome sequence data  differences in extent of LD and population structure may affect imputation accuracies more in crop or livestock analyses than in human analyses. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of imputation of genotypes from SNP panels to whole-genome sequence data in a typical dataset of domestic animals and to gain insights on the factors that affect accuracy of imputation  such as number of sequenced individuals  number of SNPs on the lower density marker panel  location and MAF of the imputed SNPs. Because in practice true genotypes are unknown  it is important to understand the underlying factors that influence imputation accuracy. Holstein Friesian cattle data provided by the 1000 bull genomes project [  ] was used in this study. Whole-genome sequence data of 114 Holstein Friesian bulls were provided by the 1000 bull genomes project (Run 2.0) [  ]. Bulls that originated from Australia  Canada  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Sweden  The Netherlands  UK  and USA  were identified as key ancestors of the global Holstein Friesian population. Each bull was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq Systems (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA). Alignment  variant calling  and quality controls were done in a multi-breed population with sequenced Holstein Friesian  Fleckvieh  Jersey  and Angus bulls as described by Daetwyler []. Variants used in our study were SNPs and INDELs (both considered as SNPs here). Two alleles (A and B) per SNP were assumed with a value of 0  1  or 2 for genotype AA  AB  or BB  respectively. To save computing time and space  only SNPs on  autosome 1 (BTA1) were used. Similar results were expected for other chromosomes. A set of sequence variants and genotypes that can be used to test imputation programs is available at request via []. Beagle 3.3.2 software [] with default parameter settings was used for imputation. No SNP edits were performed prior imputation. For each individual  the most likely genotypes were used and they were assumed to be unphased  for both the reference and validation sets. Moreover  it was assumed that all individuals were unrelated. Accuracy of imputation () was calculated as the correlation between observed and imputed genotypes. Imputed genotypes were assessed by estimated -allele dosage  which had a value between 0 and 2 and was calculated using posterior genotype probabilities as estimated by Beagle: 0 * P(AA)<U+2009>+<U+2009>1 * P(AB)<U+2009>+<U+2009>2 * P(BB). SNPs with fixed observed genotypes or estimated -allele dosages for one or more validation groups were removed. Accuracy of imputation ranged between -1 (opposite genotype imputed) and +1 (correct genotype imputed). An imputation accuracy with a value around 0 meant random imputation. To assess imputation accuracy  five-fold cross validation was performed. Individuals were randomly divided in five groups  group 1 to 5  and each group was used as validation set once. For validation individuals  SNP genotypes for SNPs corresponding to the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA; 54 609 SNPs) or Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA; 777 962 SNPs) were retained  while the remaining SNPs on the sequence panel were masked. To study the effect of number of sequenced individuals on imputation accuracy  three scenarios were considered: S80  S60  and S40. Reference group in scenarios S80  S60 and S40 contained 80% (all  except validation individuals)  60% and 40% of the individuals  respectively. In scenarios S40 and S60  the two or three following groups were designated as reference group. For example for scenario S60  if individuals in group 1 were designated as validation individuals  then individuals in group 2  3  and 4 were designated as reference individuals. According to VanRaden []  accuracy of imputation from 3 K and 6 K panels to the BovineHD beadchip was improved if the genotypes were imputed first to the BovineSNP50 and then to the BovineHD beadchip instead of directly to the BovineHD beadchip. To study if this stepwise imputation approach also improved accuracy of imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip to whole-genome sequence data  a stepwise imputation was studied in scenario S40. Individuals in the two following groups were reference individuals for imputation to the BovineHD beadchip (step 1) and individuals in the two previous groups were reference individuals for imputation to whole-genome sequence data (step 2). For example  if individuals in group 2 were designated as validation individuals  then individuals in group 3 and 4 were assigned to the reference group for step 1  and individuals in group 5 and 1 were assigned to the reference group for step 2. Factors that can influence imputation accuracy per SNP are number of sequenced individuals  distance (in base pairs) and MAF difference between an imputed SNP and its nearest SNP on the lower density marker panel  and MAF of imputed SNPs. MAF was calculated for each SNP based on all 114 individuals. For graphical representation and to illustrate the average behavior of SNPs  SNPs were binned in groups of 1000 based on distance or MAF (difference)  and these binned SNPs were used to study imputation reliability (). To investigate the relationship between imputation reliability for a SNP and the factors that may influence its value  a few simple functions were used. Although haplotypes (and not single SNPs) are used for imputation of missing SNPs  our first assumption was that imputation reliability is based on LD between known and unknown SNPs  and our second assumption was that MAF together with number of sequenced individuals will affect imputation reliability. Two functions were used to model LD between two SNPs: one was based on distance [] and one was based on difference in MAF []. The first function describes LD decay () based on effective population size () and distance of an imputed SNP to its nearest SNP on the lower density marker panel (; in Morgan):  was assumed to be equal to 100 or 1000 and for distances  it was assumed that 10 base-pairs (1 Mb) are equal to 1 centiMorgan (cM) [  ]. The second function describes the general upper limit for LD  based on difference in MAF between an imputed SNP and its nearest SNP on the lower density marker panel (dMAF) []: If two SNPs differ in MAF  LD between those SNPs is expected to be low [  ]. These two functions do not account for the MAF of imputed SNPs or number of reference individuals. With a low number of reference individuals  the probability that individuals carry the rare allele of a SNP with a low MAF is lower  thus increasing the number of reference individuals may increase imputation reliability of this SNP. To our knowledge  there is no theoretical function that describes the relationship between imputation reliability or LD and MAF of imputed SNPs or number of reference individuals. Therefore  an empirical function was derived by fitting a Michaelis-Menten function [] on the data: where  is the imputation reliability   is the estimate of the upper limit of  and  is the deflection point  i.e. the estimated MAF when  = 1/2. The Michaelis-Menten function is often used in studies on enzyme kinetics that describe the rate of enzymatic reactions based on substrate concentration []. This function was chosen because of its simplicity (two meaningful parameters) and its agreement with the observed data (starting from 0  it increases rapidly at the beginning and asymptotically approaches its maximum). The three functions mentioned each explain a part of the imputation reliability. For overall imputation reliability  the functions were multiplied: In the functions for  and   the nearest SNP on the lower density marker panel was used although it may not be the SNP that has the highest LD with the imputed SNP. To take this into account  for each SNP   was estimated for the five nearest SNPs on the lower density marker panel and  for each imputed SNP  SNPs on the lower density marker panel that had the highest value for  were selected. Next  the parameters  and  were estimated by fitting . Finally   was calculated and imputed SNPs were grouped with 1000 SNPs into bins with similar values of  and plotted against the observed  from the sequence data. BTA1 is the largest bovine chromosome and contains approximately 160.10 bp. In the current 1000 bull genomes dataset  1737 471 SNPs (of which 5.5% were INDELs) were called on BTA1 based on a multi-breed population. Of these SNPs  76.8% showed variation within the 114 Holstein Friesians. The BovineSNP50 and BovineHD panels contained respectively 3514 and 46 499 SNPs on BTA1  however  not all these SNPs were found in the sequence data. For the BovineSNP50 panel  3132 SNPs (0.18% of the SNPs in the sequence data) and the BovineHD panel  40 492 SNPs (2.33% of the SNPs in the sequence data) were found in the sequence data. Figure  presents a Venn diagram of the numbers of SNPs on BTA1 in the two lower density marker panels and in the whole-genome sequence data and numbers of overlapping SNPs.  Venn diagram showing number of SNPs on BTA1 in the two lower density marker panels (BovineSNP50 and BovineHD) and in whole-genome sequence data and overlapping numbers. Mean accuracy of imputation per SNP was assessed by cross-validation. For imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip to sequence data  it ranged between 0.37 for scenario S40 and 0.46 for S80  and for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip to sequence data  it ranged between 0.77 for scenario S40 to 0.83 for S80 (Table ). Standard deviations ranged from 0.36 to 0.37 for imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip  and from 0.27 to 0.29 for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip. In comparison to direct imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip to sequence data  stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 to the BovineHD beadchip and then to sequence data improved accuracy per SNP from 0.28 to 0.65 for scenario S40. However  it was still lower than the accuracy of imputation from the BovineHD panel to sequence data (0.77). Accuracy per SNP for stepwise imputation was found to be similar to the product of imputation accuracies for the two steps. Mean accuracy of imputation per individual was higher than mean accuracy per SNP. For imputation from the BovineSNP50 panel and from the BovineHD panel to sequence data  mean accuracies ranged from 0.78 for scenario S40 to 0.95 for S80  and from 0.93 for scenario S40 to 0.95 for S80  respectively (Table ). Reasons for this difference are discussed below. For imputation from either of the lower density marker panels  standard deviation was 0.04 for all scenarios. As for accuracy per SNP  imputation accuracy per individual was improved with stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip to sequence data for scenario S40 and reached a value similar to the product of imputation accuracies of each step. The range of variation for imputation accuracies per SNP was large (Table ). In Figures  and   this variation is illustrated for all SNPs on BTA1 for scenario S80. More SNPs had an accuracy above 0.5 for imputation from the BovineHD than from the BovineSNP50 beadchip. However  even with imputation from the BovineHD panel  SNPs from some regions of the genome were still imputed with low accuracy. For example  around the position 75.10 Mb there is a region in which the distance between imputed SNPs and SNPs on the BovineHD panel is large and for which imputation was difficult (Figure B). This region contained SNPs that are on the BovineHD panel  but since they did not segregate in the sequence data  no genotypes were available.

Figure  shows the mean imputation reliability versus distance to the nearest SNP on the BovineHD beadchip for the three scenarios. Imputation reliability (imputation accuracy squared) decreased with increasing distance between imputed SNP and nearest SNP on the BovineHD panel. This decrease in imputation reliability follows the decay in LD  described as   for <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000. Even at very small distances  the observed imputation reliability is lower than . In addition to this distance effect  reference group size has an effect. Since imputations from the BovineHD and BovineSNP50 panels showed similar patterns for distance and all other factors  only the results for the imputation from the BovineHD panel are shown.  Distance to the nearest SNP on the BovineHD beadchip versus mean imputation reliability for imputation from the BovineHD panel to whole-genome sequence data on BTA1 for the three scenarios (S40  S60  and S80); SNPs were grouped in bins of 1000 SNPs with similar distance; the predicted LD  was calculated with assumed effective population sizes () of 100 (dashed line) and 1000 (solid line). The difference in MAF between imputed SNPs and their nearest SNPs on the BovineHD beadchip determines the maximum LD between two SNPs. Figure  shows this MAF difference versus  and versus mean imputation reliability for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip for all three scenarios. For differences in MAF below 0.05  imputation reliability was below   which was in agreement with expectation based on maximum LD. For larger differences in MAF  observed imputation reliabilities were above estimations from . This pattern implies that other SNPs than only the nearest SNP on the BovineHD panel influenced imputation reliability.  Differences in MAF between imputed SNP and the nearest SNP on the BovineHD beadchip versus predicted LD  and versus mean imputation reliability for imputation from the BovineHD panel to whole-genome sequence data on BTA1 for the three scenarios (S40  S60  and S80); SNPs were grouped in bins of 1000 SNPs with similar MAF differences. The effect of MAF of imputed SNPs on imputation reliability is shown in Figure   with a Michaelis-Menten curve fitted for each scenario separately. Imputation reliability increased with increasing MAF. This increase in imputation reliability was more pronounced at a MAF below 0.2. The estimated value for the upper limit of  () was 1.01 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) for scenario S40  0.98 for S60 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.005)  and 0.95 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004) for S80. The maximum value of  at the maximum MAF value (MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5) was 0.881 for scenario S40  0.893 for S60  and 0.886 for S80. The estimated MAF when  = 1/2  or at the deflection point  was equal to 0.073 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002) for scenario S40  0.049 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) for S60 and 0.036 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) for S80.  Combined effect of MAF of imputed SNPs and scenario (S40  S60  and S80) on reliability of imputation from the BovineHD beadchip to whole-genome sequence data on BTA1; SNPs per scenario were grouped in bins of 1000 SNPs with similar MAF; for each scenario a Michaelis-Menten function was fitted. Figure  shows the overall estimation of imputation reliability (  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000) against observed imputation reliability for the three scenarios (S40  S60  S80). The estimated  followed the observed reliabilities closely  although the estimated  were higher than the observed reliabilities. At low    the observed imputation reliability deviated more from estimated . In particular  scenarios with a higher number of individuals showed larger observed imputation reliabilities compared to the estimated .  Overall prediction of imputation reliability (  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1000) plotted against observed imputation reliability for imputation from the BovineHD panel to whole-genome sequence data on BTA1 for three scenarios (S40  S60  and S80); SNPs were grouped in bins of 1000 SNPs with similar . Our objective was to investigate accuracy of imputation from the lower density SNP panels to whole-genome sequence data in Holstein Friesian cattle. Accuracy of imputation was defined as the correlation between observed genotypes and the imputed -allele dosages. Mean accuracy of imputation per SNP to whole-genome sequence data was equal to 0.46 with 0.18% of SNPs known (BovineSNP50)  and 0.83 with 2.33% of SNPs known (BovineHD). We chose to use the correlation between observed and imputed genotypes to measure accuracy of imputation  whereas most studies used percentage of correctly imputed SNPs. Compared to correlation between observed and imputed genotypes  percentage of correctly imputed SNPs does not account for the (low) MAF of imputed SNPs. A necessary condition for correlation between two random variables is that both variables show variation. Therefore  SNPs with fixed observed genotypes or estimated -allele dosages for one or more validation groups were removed. This might have caused a positive bias in the results  because of removal of monomorphic loci with poor imputation. In other studies e.g. [    ]  criteria such as MAF greater than 0.01 were used in data editing procedures. If this type of criteria had been applied to the sequence data in our study  a large number of SNPs (987 514) would have been removed  which is similar to what occurred with the criterion chosen here. Previous studies showed that increasing the number of close relatives between imputed and reference individuals increased imputation accuracy [–  ]. The sequenced bulls in this study were key ancestors of the global Holstein Friesian population and in general  were not very closely related. In fact  in some cases  they were chosen to be as little related as possible  in order to maximize sequencing effort of unique chromosome segments. A genomic relationship matrix [] was constructed based on SNPs found on BTA1. About 90% of the off-diagonals were below 0.125 and 0.5% were above 0.5 (results not shown). In practice  these sequenced bulls will be used as reference individuals to impute genotypes of other individuals in the current population  which might be their progeny or otherwise closely related individuals. Therefore  it is expected that  in practice  imputation accuracies will be higher than those estimated in this study. SNPs used in this study were called in a larger multi-breed population than the 114 Holstein individuals included here. Ideally  to better mimic the reality and answer the question on how many individuals need to be sequenced  the number of reference individuals used in the three scenarios should also be used for variant calling. This is important since the set of individuals used for variant calling influences the called genotypes and therefore a bias might be introduced in this study. However  we expect that the effect on the results is small  because we disregarded SNPs that did not show variation in either the reference or validation set. These are also SNPs that will not be called if only the Holstein individuals are used for variant calling. Another deviation from a real situation is that  for imputation  we assumed that the called genotypes from the sequence data were true genotypes  while it would have been more correct to use the probabilities of inferred genotypes from the sequence data as starting point for imputation. Therefore  imputation accuracies estimated in this study may differ slightly from accuracies obtained from “true genotypes”. Mean imputation accuracy per SNP from the BovineSNP50 panel to whole-genome sequence data was below 0.46. Our results showed that an alternative approach  i.e. using stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 to the BovineHD panel and then to sequence data  also yielded high accuracies of imputation. For example  in scenario S40  accuracy of the stepwise imputation was higher (0.65) than that of direct imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip to sequence data (0.37) or even than that of direct imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip in scenario S80 (0.46). Such a high accuracy with the stepwise approach was unexpected  because less information was available in the reference set. In the two-step approach  20% of the individuals had genotypes similar to those of the BovineSNP50 panel (validation individuals)  40% had genotypes similar to those of the BovineHD panel (reference individuals step 1)  and 40% had sequenced genotypes (reference individuals step 2). Whereas  in scenario S80  with direct imputation from the BovineSNP50 panel to sequence data  all reference individuals (80% of all individuals) had sequenced genotypes. VanRaden [] found an increase in imputation accuracy of about 2% when imputation was done from 3000 SNPs to 50 000 SNPs and then to 777 000 SNPs compared to direct imputation from 3000 SNPs to 777 000 SNPs. Although less information is used  the reason why there is this increase in imputation accuracy is not clear. However  one reason could be that the imputation algorithm has problems with selecting the correct haplotypes since there are multiple possible matches between sequence haplotypes and a BovineSNP50 haplotype  whereas there are less possible matches when BovineHD genotypes are added in between. In this case  there is a higher probability of selecting the long range haplotypes in the first step  and the short range haplotypes in the second step  which increases accuracy of imputation. In cattle  many individuals with BovineHD genotypes are available. Using those individuals to impute BovineSNP50 genotypes to BovineHD genotypes may increase the accuracy gained in the first step  which would result in even higher accuracies when using the two-step approach than those obtained here. In some species  this is not a realistic scenario because no high-density marker panel is available yet  i.e. for pig. Developing these high-density panels and re-genotyping individuals can be expensive  especially if the end goal is to impute to sequence genotypes. In a scenario in which no high-density panel is available  it might be more cost effective to sequence additional animals and use the two-step approach by masking part of the SNPs of the individuals used for the first imputation step. This will mimic a high-density marker panel  and according to the results reported here  the overall imputation accuracy would be higher than that obtained by direct imputation from the lower density SNP chip. An improvement of this step-wise approach could be to use information of all individuals in the reference population in both steps instead of using disjoint reference sets as was done in this study  to mimic dairy cattle breeding practice. In the former case  the expected advantage is that all the genotype information will be available in the last step  while with disjoint datasets  the masked genotype information of individuals in the first step is not used in the second step. Moreover  it would be interesting to investigate the use of more than two steps because there may be an optimum number of steps to reach the highest accuracy. In genomic selection  it is important to know the imputation accuracy per individual  because there is a direct relation with the accuracy of genomic prediction [] and therefore the response of selection. In the present study  mean imputation accuracy per individual was higher compared to mean imputation accuracy per SNP  which was also reported by Mulder []. They argued that allele frequencies bias imputation accuracy per individual and suggested to subtract mean genotype per SNP from observed and imputed genotypes. We tested this hypothesis and showed it had a small effect i.e. the mean accuracy of imputation from the BovineHD panel per individual in scenario S80 decreased only by 0.04 to reach 0.90. After standardization for the genotype variance per SNP  mean accuracy of imputation per individual in scenario S80 decreased furthermore to 0.87. This standardized mean accuracy per individual is still higher compared to the mean accuracy per SNP  however  the remaining bias is small and might be explained by a correlation between imputations of markers within a haplotype within an individual []. Using whole-genome sequence data for genomic prediction and GWAS is interesting because the actual polymorphisms that cause genetic differences are potentially included in the data e.g. [–]. The distribution of allele frequencies of causal mutations is not known  but it is hypothesized that those mutations may have a low MAF []. To calculate imputation accuracy  all SNPs with fixed observed genotypes or estimated -allele dosages for one or more validation groups were removed. The remaining numbers of SNPs per scenario and per SNP chip are in Table . In the case of imputation from the BovineHD panel in scenario S80  744 896 SNPs remained and 992 575 SNPs were removed from the dataset. It is possible that removing these SNPs without changing the allele dosage affected the results. Of the removed SNPs  40.6% had a MAF of 0  which could have been easily imputed with a 100% accuracy  56.1% had a MAF between 0 and 0.1 and their imputation accuracy could have been affected by their low MAF only  and the remaining 3.3% had a MAF above 0.1  which could have been difficult to impute for other reasons than their low MAF. However  it is unlikely that these 3.3% SNPs could affect the average imputation accuracy of common markers because of their small number. Although many loci with a low MAF in the observed genotypes were removed  among the remaining SNPs those with a lower MAF were more difficult to impute correctly and the reliability of imputation varied more than for the SNPs with a higher MAF. These findings may potentially limit the benefit of using imputed sequence data for genomic prediction and GWAS. However  decay in imputation reliability for SNPs with a lower MAF was smaller in the scenarios with more reference individuals than those with less reference individuals  which confirms results with human data []. In large-sized reference populations  there is more chance to have multiple allele copies to construct the haplotypes []. Moreover  Howie [] showed that a multi-population reference panel can improve imputation accuracy for SNPs with a low MAF  because a low-frequency allele in one population can be more frequent in another population. Since it is expected that  in the near future  more individuals from more different breeds will be sequenced in cattle  it is assumed that imputation accuracy of SNPs with a low MAF will improve. Still  in species with a small number of sequenced individuals  imputation of SNPs with a low MAF may remain an issue. In such a situation  it might be beneficial to use another algorithm for imputation  such as IMPUTE [] or MaCH []. It is claimed that these methods perform better compared to Beagle when the number of reference individuals is low [  ] and for SNPs with a low MAF []. All three methods use Hidden Markov models  but IMPUTE and MaCH model genotypes on a set of haplotypes without clustering  whereas Beagle uses haplotype clustering strategies and therefore may miss SNPs with a low MAF [  ]. Clustering strategies as in Beagle reduce computer time and memory use compared to IMPUTE and MaCH  which is an advantage when handling large datasets []. Although the assumption that the polymorphisms responsible for genetic differences are included in the dataset may be true for sequence data  for imputed sequence data it is important to know if polymorphisms are imputed correctly. Beagle calculates an allelic R measure  which predicts accuracy of imputation per SNP. Allelic R is the squared correlation between allele dosage of the most likely imputed genotype and allele dosage of the true imputed genotype [] and the closer these are  the more accurate the imputation is for the SNP. The correlation between the allelic R measure from Beagle and true imputation reliability that we calculated was equal to 0.79 for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip to sequence data in scenario S80 (results not shown). Of the 622 862 SNPs with estimates for both measures  67 2% showed a difference between the allelic R measure from Beagle and true imputation reliability of less than 0.1  although the maximum difference between both measures was 0.78. This indicates that the allelic R measure provided by Beagle gives a good indication of imputation reliability in general  although in specific cases it may severely underestimate imputation reliability. In human studies  imputed genotypes did not result in a high increase in power in GWAS compared to lower density marker panels [    ]. Therefore  it is important to understand the underlying factors that affect imputation reliability and to take those factors into account when imputing genotypes. An important factor that influences imputation reliability is the LD between the imputed SNP and the SNP on the lower density marker panel. This may reduce the advantage of using imputed sequence data for genomic predictions or GWAS  compared to true sequence data. The advantage with true sequence data is the lack of dependency on LD between an SNP and the causal mutation in the sequence data  assuming that the true causal variant was accurately identified in the data. Our results showed that successful imputation of the causal mutation depended on the LD between the SNP on the lower density marker panel and the causal mutation. Hence  causal mutations that are poorly tagged by the low-density SNP panel will also be difficult to detect for reliable imputation. In the current Holstein Friesian population  the effective population size is estimated to be around 100 [  ]. However  Figure  shows that the decay in imputation accuracy based on a  of 1000 seemed more appropriate for our data than a  of 100. Hayes . [] reported that LD at very short distances is related to effective population sizes in the past  while LD at longer distances is related to current effective population sizes. In our study  LD was calculated on very short distances  which suggests that a historical value should be used for   rather than the current value of 100. Another reason for imputation reliability to decay more quickly than that expected from the decay in LD based on a  of 100 is that other factors also affected imputation reliability  or that the factors interacted with respect to their effect on accuracy. For example  when the SNP selected on the high-density panel and the SNP in the sequence are close  their MAF may be comparable  while as the distance between them increases the difference in MAF may also increase. Since these factors  distance and MAF  have a multiplicative effect  the decay in imputation reliability is larger than that expected from the decay in LD based on a  of 100. This expectation is confirmed by the resemblance between the combined functions for  of 100 (results not shown) and the combined functions for  of 1000 (Figure ). Another factor that affected LD was the difference in MAF  which at first sight may be an unexpected indicator for imputation accuracy  especially since haplotypes are used for imputation. However  as shown in other studies [    ] the difference in MAF determines the mathematical upper limit of the LD between two SNPs. At extreme differences in MAF  alleles at the different SNPs cannot match  even if the distance between SNPs is small. For example  the maximum possible correlation obtained for two random binary variables with a MAF of 0.45 and 0.05  respectively  is 0.06. Thus  for two SNPs at the same distance  LD may differ and they may be in different haplotypes used for imputation. This could be particularly important since the SNPs included in the SNP panels are not randomly selected and generally have a high MAF. Imputation reliability was also affected by the MAF of the imputed SNPs and by the number of sequenced individuals. Our results indicate that  if causal mutations have a low MAF  a large-sized reference group is required to impute those mutations correctly and to benefit from using sequence data  which confirms previous reports [  ]. Extrapolation of  using a power function (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.999) showed that  with more than 500 reference individuals  the increase in imputation reliability was expected to be small (results not shown). This agrees with other cattle studies that used lower density marker data and showed that  with more than 1000 reference individuals  the increase in imputation accuracy is expected to be small [  ]. The goal of imputation is to assemble a large group of individuals with phenotypic information and sequence genotypes for genomic prediction or GWAS. For power calculations in GWAS  imputation reliability (not only overall imputation reliability but also imputation reliability per SNP because of the variation between SNPs) should be taken into account when imputed genotypes are used []. Our results show that functions that estimate LD based on distance only or on the difference in MAF between the imputed SNP and the closest SNP on the lower density marker panel did not provide a good indication of imputation reliability. When these functions were combined with an empirical derived function that corrects for MAF of the imputed SNPs and size of the reference group  a much better indication of imputation reliability was obtained but it was still not perfect (Figure ). The same functions also held for BTA29  even when using estimates for  and  based on BTA1 (results not shown). Hence within this population and dataset  the predictions hold across chromosomes  at least on average since bins of 1000 SNPs were used. However  these functions could be further improved. For example  currently the functions are based on the use of an individual SNP (the closest SNP or the SNP in highest LD of the five closest SNPs) to estimate imputation reliability  whereas a program like Beagle uses haplotypes for imputation. Moreover  instead of choosing the closest SNP  a more distant SNP might be in higher LD with the imputed SNP. Therefore  using all SNPs or haplotypes is likely to estimate imputation reliability better than the functions used here. However  taking all SNPs into account or using haplotypes will make estimation more time-consuming and less generic applicable. Further research using simulation is necessary to investigate the generality of the estimations and the obtained imputation reliability. However  our study shows that the functions described above provide a good indication of the factors that affect imputation reliability per SNP. Obviously  imputation reliability does not rely only on LD  MAF  and reference group size. Other factors  such as genotyping errors []  or degree of relationship between validation and reference groups [    ]  are also important. It has been reported that increasing the number of close relatives in the reference group increased accuracy of imputation and that this increase was more pronounced when the differences between number of SNPs genotyped in the validation and reference populations were large (such as the differences between BovineSNP50 or BovineHD and sequence data) []. Accuracy of imputation to whole-genome sequence data was generally high for imputation from the BovineHD beadchip  but was low for imputation from the BovineSNP50 beadchip. Stepwise imputation from the BovineSNP50 to the BovineHD beadchip and to sequence data substantially improved accuracy of imputation. SNPs with a lower MAF were more difficult to impute correctly and led to more variation in reliability of imputation. Functions that estimate LD based on distance only or on the difference in MAF between the imputed SNP and the closest SNP on the lower density marker panel did not provide a good indication of imputation reliability. However  when these functions were combined with an empirical derived function that corrects for MAF of the imputed SNPs and size of the reference group  estimation of imputation reliability was greatly improved.

As measured by the matrix distance  the best AIP for QTL mapping were those that best captured LD between a tested position and a QTL. Moreover the matrix distance between a tested position and a QTL was shown to decrease for some AIP when LD increased. However  the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0 1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations  than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS )  for which there was no lower bound. The expected LD between haplotypes at a tested position and alleles at a QTL is a quantity that increases naturally when the tested position gets closer to the QTL. This behavior was demonstrated with pig and unrelated human chromosomes.ConclusionsWhen the density of markers is high  and therefore LD between adjacent loci can be assumed to be high  the discrete predictor IBS  is recommended since it predicts allele identity correctly when taking LD into account."

However  the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0 1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations  than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS )  for which there was no lower bound. The expected LD between haplotypes at a tested position and alleles at a QTL is a quantity that increases naturally when the tested position gets closer to the QTL. This behavior was demonstrated with pig and unrelated human chromosomes. When the density of markers is high  and therefore LD between adjacent loci can be assumed to be high  the discrete predictor IBS  is recommended since it predicts allele identity correctly when taking LD into account. Numerous methods have been developed to predict allelic identity at an unobserved locus between pairs of chromosome segments. Such predictions are generally carried out by observing allelic similarities between the pairs of chromosome segments that surround this locus [–]. It is assumed that chromosome segments that exhibit more similarities have a higher chance of harboring the same allele(s) at this locus. Many of these methods [–] use either directly or implicitly the concept of identity-by-descent (IBD)  and therefore predict allelic identity based on allelic likeness. Such predictions of allelic identity can be either continuous or discrete in the [0 1] interval. The matrices that contain these predictions for pairs of chromosome segments  at an unobserved locus  can be used in a statistical procedure to detect association between the locus and some phenotypes of interest. For example  these matrices can be interpreted as being proportional to the covariance matrices of the effect of the locus on phenotypes of interest [    ] and therefore play a central role in the statistical analysis of the variability. The similarity between chromosome segments can be measured based on the haplotypes of markers carried by the segments. Indeed  it has been shown that haplotype-based methods have a higher potential to detect trait-marker associations than single-marker methods in some cases [–]. Different methods for predicting allelic identity  hereafter named Allelic Identity Predictors (AIP)  have been proposed and in this study  we have compared some of these methods i.e.: (1) the probability measure described by Meuwissen and Goddard [] is the conditional probability of being IBD at an unobserved locus for pairs of haplotypes  given the identical-by-state (IBS) status of alleles spanning that position; (2) the similarity score of Li and Jiang [] calculates the sum of the number of shared alleles and the length of the longest shared substring that spans an unobserved locus for pairs of haplotypes; (3) the probability model of Browning [] is based on Variable Length Markov Chains (VLMC) and performs chromosome clustering at a given marker  and in this model  chromosomes that belong to a given cluster are considered as potentially harboring the same unobserved allele(s) locally; and (4) the IBS status of all marker alleles between pairs of haplotypes and (5) the IBS status of single markers alleles  which are the simplest AIP. In some association studies  such as those that use random effect models for example  the only input that differs from one AIP to another is the similarity (covariance) matrix built for the tested location. Thus  investigating the properties of similarity matrices is another strategy when comparing AIP  since this comparison is generally based on the accuracy of quantitative trait locus (QTL) localization (e.g. root mean square error). The main objective of the present study was to understand the relation between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes  by identifying the properties of similarity matrices in the neighborhood of a QTL and at the QTL. This was performed using a simple distance measure between these matrices and the similarity matrix at the QTL based on the observed allelic identity (IBS). This distance measure was expressed analytically in terms of LD coefficients. There has been an increasing interest in taking advantage of LD for fine-mapping of complex disease genes [–] and QTL [–]. Nevertheless  to the best of our knowledge  no study has yet used analytical methods to compare AIP in relation to LD. Here  we define a new criterion based on the chosen matrix distance measure  which allows discrimination between the six AIP. We evaluated the consistency of this criterion with the mapping accuracy of the six AIP for a QTL simulated according to different LD patterns and populations. The simulations were based on two population types  a set of human chromosomes and a set of porcine chromosomes  with different LD and density patterns. In each case  the QTL was a hidden SNP that simulated a biallelic QTL  as previously proposed [      ]. Hence  the present study was framed around the common idea that there is a favorable allele at the QTL  which affects an observed trait. In this context  the aim of AIP is to predict  at the QTL  whether both chromosomal segments of any pair harbor the same unobserved favorable allele or not  which is the same as predicting the IBS or non-IBS state of the alleles. A new (6) unreferenced AIP  named trained predictor and abbreviated as TP  is also compared in this paper. This new predictor  based on a matrix distance concept similar to the one used to discriminate between the AIP  performs least squares prediction in a global fashion over chromosomes. The purpose of this predictor was to investigate the behavior of an AIP which performs global training over the chromosomes in relation to local patterns of LD. Let  be a set of positions that are tested for the presence of a QTL on 2 phased homologous chromosomes for  diploid individuals. Only one QTL is considered to be in the screened region. In a sliding window approach  each position tested is considered to be the unobserved center of the haplotypes carried by different chromosome segments. Figure  shows an example of tested positions for a sliding window of six markers and a QTL located between SNPs 39 and 40.                                                                                                                                       Let  be the IBS or IBD prediction of allelic identity  depending on an AIP  at a tested position   for a couple (  ) of chromosome segments. Note that  is calculated according to the observed similarity between the haplotypes carried by  and . Hence   and  can harbor different unobserved alleles at  even if these segments carry the same haplotype. We define  as the similarity matrix built from the predictions of allelic identity at locus  for . Matrix  can be used in a statistical procedure to detect association between  and some phenotype of interest. Let  be the true allelic identity observed at the QTL (IBS) for a couple (  ) of chromosome segments. On the basis of known alleles at the QTL  the similarity  can be built with the real allelic identities. Note that  is simply a similarity matrix that describes the IBS or non-IBS state of alleles at the QTL. Let  be a normalized distance measure between  and  induced by the entrywise 1-norm  which is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of two matrices or vectors  i.e. Note that some AIP have continuous prediction errors  in [ 0 1]  while for others  prediction errors are limited to the discrete set {0 1}. Measure  is therefore more appropriate than the euclidean metric   for example  because it does not shrink continuous prediction errors in [ 0 1]. Let  be the position of the QTL. When a predictor  performs well   should be minimum at the tested position closest to . Hence  can be used to compare different AIP for a set of tested positions. Note that  can also be expressed as [see Additional file ]: where =2 is the number of possible observed haplotypes at position   for a sliding window of  markers.  and  are the frequencies of haplotypes  and  at position   respectively. Note that some haplotypes among the  possible haplotypes may not be observed in practice. Hence  the corresponding frequencies for these haplotypes will naturally be equal to 0 in expression (1).  is the proportion of identical alleles shared at the QTL by the pairs of chromosomes that carry  and   at position   and  is the prediction of allelic identity at locus  for the predictor  and a pair (  ) of haplotypes. Expression (1) will be used subsequently to express  as a function of LD coefficients  and to understand the trained predictor defined in this paper. The AIP evaluated in this study were IBS  (IBS status of alleles at single markers)  IBS  (IBS status of all marker alleles between pairs of haplotypes)  P(IBD) (IBD probability of Meuwissen and Goddard [])  Score (similarity score of Li and Jiang [])  Beagle (cluster-based probability model of Browning []) and TP (the trained predictor). Note that the tested positions coincide with marker positions for IBS  and Beagle. These positions are therefore different from those in Figure . The tested positions for IBS   P(IBD)  Score and TP are defined as presented in Figure . IBS  gives an allelic identity prediction of 1 if a pair of chromosome segments carries the same allele at a tested marker and 0 otherwise. With IBS  the prediction of allelic identity is equal to 1 if both chromosome segments of a pair carry the same marker alleles for haplotypes that span the tested position   and 0 otherwise. P(IBD) is an estimation of the conditional probability of being IBD at  for a pair of chromosome segments  given the IBS status of marker alleles of the haplotypes spanning . This measure of probability is based on a coalescence process and models recombination between markers. The P(IBD) function was applied here with an ancestral effective population size of 100 and 100 generations from the base population  as in Meuwissen and Goddard []. Meuwissen and Goddard [] showed that violations of these assumptions  i.e. that alter the effective population size and the number of generations since the base population  had no effect on the mapping accuracy of their methods [  ]. For a pair of haplotypes carried by two chromosome segments  Score is the summation of the number of IBS alleles and the length of the longest common substring of IBS alleles that span . Score integrates weight functions that decrease the significance of markers based on their genetic distance from . As proposed in Li and Jiang []  these functions were chosen to be one minus the distance  in centiMorgan (cM)  of each marker from  on the haplotypes within the sliding window (as presented in Figure ). Beagle clusters chromosomes or haplotypes locally at a tested marker if they have similar probabilities of carrying the same alleles at following adjacent markers. The Beagle probability model was built at each marker by running the Beagle software (Beagle 3.3.2;   Browning []  Browning and Browning []) and fitting all the chromosome markers at one time. The Beagle probability model needs two parameters (scale and shift) to be built. These parameters were first estimated from the data using a cross-validation procedure. However  the mapping results were less accurate than those obtained with the default values for these parameters that were proposed by the authors. According to the authors  the default values have performed well in simulation studies and real data analyses [  ]. Hence the default values scale = 4.0 and shift = 0.2 [] were used. The trained predictor (TP)  built by least squares prediction  is based on the idea that pairs of haplotypes that exhibit the same amount of allelic similarity should have the same probability of harboring identical alleles  regardless of the tested positions they span. Estimates for  can be obtained as follows. Let  be a set of observed SNPs on chromosomes  which are called target SNPs. Each target SNP  is defined as the middle marker of a sliding window of +1 loci  where  is the number of observed flanking markers used to predict allelic identity at the target SNP. Let  be the real allele identity at  for (  ) and let  be the mean squared prediction errors over  for TP  i.e. Note that the expression of the normalized squared euclidean distance    in terms of frequencies and proportions is analogous to that of  in (1). Indeed    and  at locus  are defined as in (1). Estimates for  are obtained by differentiating  with respect to   i.e. Note that the second derivative of  with respect to  is positive since it is a sum of frequencies. This implies that  reaches a minimum for the set of estimates   since  is a sum of convex functions of each . Hence  TP associates  to any observed couple (  ) at any tested position . The observed target SNPs () are used to estimate the predictions of allelic identity for TP and should not be confused with the unobserved tested positions (). The following mixed models were used to test for the presence of a QTL at a given position  for all AIP: where  is a fixed effect  which is the overall mean  and  is a vector of  ones. Vector  represents the random polygenic effects due to relationships among individuals  i.e.  where  is the additive relationship matrix built from the pedigree [  ].  and  are design matrices that link random effects to individuals and  is the vector of homoscedastic error terms  i.e. . In the model corresponding to (H)   is a vector of random effects of haplotypes at position   i.e.   where  (=) corresponds to the number of observed haplotypes  or alleles  at position . Note that  has the same dimension  for all AIP except for IBS  and Beagle. The tested positions coincide with marker positions for these two predictors. At a tested marker   =2 for IBS  and  is equal to the number of local clusters for Beagle. Therefore  depending on the predictor    is a similarity matrix based on either distinct observed haplotypes (e.g.  Score) or distinct clusters (e.g.  Beagle). Note that  and  are equivalent sources of data contingent upon the list of haplotypes  or distinct local clusters  for the chromosome segments at any tested position. Indeed  depending on   one can build  from  in one of the two following ways. (1)   where () and () are the haplotype numbers carried by chromosomes  and   respectively or (2)   where  and  are the cluster numbers to which chromosomes  and  belong  respectively. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm was used for the restricted maximum likelihoods of the mixed models [–]  to estimate the components        and the variance terms . Let  be the restricted maximum likelihood ratio test (RLRT) of (H) versus (H) for position   i.e. We defined  as the estimated position of a QTL for a predictor   i.e. To compare the predictive ability of the different predictors in relation to LD  we defined  as the tested position where  is minimized for a predictor   i.e. Consequently  we defined the relative efficiency of a predictor  as follows. Predictor  is considered to be more efficient than a predictor  if where |.| is the absolute value. When  was not unique  the mean of the different argmins was retained as . Inequality () states that the tested position associated with the best prediction  of the allele identity at the QTL  is closer to the QTL for  than that for . Inequality () states that the true allelic identity at the QTL is better predicted by  at  than by  at .  simulations (=1 ..  ) were performed to evaluate the mapping accuracy and the relative efficiency of the different AIP in different situations. The mapping accuracy of the simulated QTL was evaluated for each AIP with the root mean square error (RMSE): The relative efficiency of each AIP was evaluated by considering the three following quantities: where RMSE  and  measure conditions () and ()  defined in the paragraph on relative efficiency  and  measures the standard deviation of the matrix distance at . A sliding window of =6 markers was chosen for all analyses  except for IBS  and Beagle. Windows of six and 12 markers were previously shown to be optimal for QTL mapping accuracy [  ] with 60K type SNP chips. Hence  all analyses were done using a sliding window of =6 markers  except for IBS  and Beagle  to make comparison between the series of results easier. A set of 90 human chromosomes 21 from unrelated Han Chinese individuals from Beijing (HCB)  and a set of 235 swine chromosomes 18 from French Large White (FLW) pigs  were used for LD and matrix distance computations. The 90 HCB chromosomes were genotyped for 16 881 SNPs and are available from the HapMap project website (). The FLW chromosomes were genotyped for 1252 SNPs using the Illumina Porcine 60K+SNP iSelect Beadchip []. Only 14 976 SNPs on the HCB chromosomes and 969 SNPs on the FLW chromosomes for which the minor allele frequency was greater than 5% were retained for analysis. The LD and matrix distance computations were conducted for the HCB and the FLW chromosomes. The QTL simulations were only conducted for the FLW chromosomes for which a pedigree was available. The marker density varied across the FLW chromosomes based on physical distance in kilobase. One megabase was considered equivalent to 1 cM for conversion in this study. LD between a tested position  and a QTL was measured using the multiallelic measure  of LD as suggested by [–]. Let  be the LD coefficient between haplotype  at position  and allele  at the QTL.  is the frequency of haplotype  defined by the marker haplotype  that spans position  and allele  at the QTL.  is the frequency of allele  at the QTL and  is haplotype  frequency at . Note that . Hence  for a biallelic QTL   can be expressed as: where  and  are the Hardy-Weinberg heterozygosities at  and the QTL respectively and .  and  are expected to increase as the tested position  gets closer to a QTL. The general behaviors of the normalized measure  and the non-normalized measure  were described by computing the LD between the haplotypes at successive distinct positions  using a sliding window  and the alleles of a fixed SNP centered over a region of 81 markers on the chromosomes. The fixed SNP was centered over a region of 76 distinct overlapping sliding windows available within the region of 81 markers. The 76 distinct positions associated to the windows played the role of the tested positions of an association study. The fixed SNP played the role of a biallelic QTL. The computation was repeated for all possible regions of 81 successive markers. Since 969 SNPs were retained on the 235 porcine chromosomes  computation was performed for 889 (969-81 + 1 = 889) regions of 81 markers. The same procedure was performed on the HCB chromosomes  thus leading to 14 896 possible regions for this set of chromosomes. The empirical means of the 889 FLW and the 14 896 HCB LD profiles were then computed to describe the expected behaviors of  and . Another major purpose of these computations was to help the analytical comparison of the AIP and the associated matrix distances  which can be expressed as elements of multiallelic LD (see Results section). The distributions of the matrix distance for the six compared AIP  as function of local multiallelic LD  were also evaluated on the FLW and HCB chromosomes. The matrix distances for the six AIP were calculated at 966 and 14 973 possible target SNPs for the FLW and HCB chromosomes  respectively. The target SNPs were defined in exactly the same way as used for the trained predictor (TP). The matrix distances calculated at each window that harbors a target SNP for the six AIP were then plotted against the multiallelic measure  of LD between the haplotypes and the target alleles within the window. The 235 FLW chromosomes were included in =200 gene-drop simulations  in a 25-generation pedigree for the FLW breed  using the LDSO software []. The pedigree was composed of 1594 founders  3373 sires and 7100 dams. The gene-drop procedure was used to generate different realistic genealogy structures between the chromosomes. For each gene-drop the 235 FLW chromosomes were uniformly distributed  with replacement  among the 1594 founders of the pedigree. Hence  the measured LD structure for mapping among descendant individuals at the end of each gene-drop was almost the same as on the 235 FLW chromosomes. It must be emphasized that the use of replicates of only 235 chromosomes to populate 1594 diploid founders  followed by 25 generations of recombinations events  means that the number of different haplotypes at a position is much lower than 3188 (2 × 1594). Thus  the results correspond to medium range population sizes. After each gene-drop  only the chromosomes and phenotypes of the =485 individuals of generation 25 were retained for subsequent analyzes. Three distant SNPs were chosen as putative QTL  in order to have different LD levels with the six-marker haplotype that surrounds them on the 235 initial FLW chromosomes. Two different QTL effects were simulated for each of these SNPs  thus leading to six different scenarios. The LD between these SNPs and the observed haplotypes that harbored them was measured using the multiallelic measure  of LD. The LD levels around the three SNPs were equal to 0.52  0.18 and 0.08  and the lengths of the haplotypes harboring them were equal to 0.09 cM  0.37 cM and 0.75 cM  respectively. Note that these differences in length were due to the different marker densities in the distinct regions that harbor each putative QTL. The length of the region scanned for QTL mapping around each simulated QTL was approximately 3 cM. The phenotypes in the pedigree were computed as   where  are normal random polygenic effects of the parents with variance 0.5   is a normal random mendelian sampling effect with variance 0.25 and  is a normal random environmental effect with variance 1.  is the QTL genotype effect of individual . QTL genotype effect was first computed as  or 0 or -2  if the QTL genotype of individual  was  or  or  respectively. In the same way a second set of simulations was carried out with the QTL genotype effect computed as  or 0 or -0.5. Only the gene-drop simulations for which the minor allele frequency at the QTL was greater or equal to 0.1 were retained. Each simulated QTL was verified for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium during simulations. Hence  under the standard model  where the dominance effect is equal to 0 as in this study  the first simulated QTL effect explained at most 57% of the phenotypic variance for equal frequencies at the QTL. In the same way  the second simulated QTL effect explained at most 8% of the phenotypic variance. This section gives theoretical and empirical results that show that  compared to others  some AIP exhibit a better behavior for the decrease of their matrix distance  as defined by expression (1)  when the multiallelic LD between a tested position and a QTL increases. In summary  the theoretical results show that expression (1) can be written as a function of the multiallelic LD coefficients of   and that the decreasing behavior of this function depends on the nature of the AIP (see equations ()  (3)  (4)  (5) and (6) of this section). The empirical results show that  is expected to be highest when the tested position is closest to the QTL (see Figure  of this section). The expectation taken for the multiallelic LD was the empirical mean  which was found to converge for distant regions on the chromosomes. These regions can be assumed to be independent  thus showing an expected behavior for the multiallelic LD. The empirical results also show that the tested position that minimizes the matrix distance is highly correlated with the mapping accuracy of the AIP (see sub-section on mapping accuracy and relative efficiency of this section).                                                                                                    Figure  shows the empirical means of the 889 FLW and the 14 896 HCB LD profiles for  and . In Figure  the values of  and  increase  as expected  as the tested position  moves closer to the QTL. This implies that the sum of the  terms increases on average as position  moves toward the QTL. The highest expected values for  and   in Figure  are reached for the tested position closest to the QTL. Note that the range of values for   in Figure  is smaller than that of . This is due to the lack of a normalization factor for . Based on expression (1)   can be re-written as [see Additional file ]: Replacing the 2 frequencies in expression (2) by the () LD coefficient terms and the product of marginal frequencies gives [see Additional file ]: where  and  are sums and products of marginal frequencies  allelic identity predictions and LD coefficient terms. The general behavior of   with respect to   is unspecifiable due to its complexity. For instance  the behavior of  cannot be specified for continuous AIP in [0 1]. However for    reduces to a sum of strictly concave functions of each LD coefficient [see Additional file ]  i.e. where  and F are sums and products of marginal frequencies that do not depend on LD coefficients. Let  be the critical value for each  function.  will decrease if the squared or absolute deviation of each  term from its corresponding  increases [see Additional file ]. However note that the squared deviations of all  terms from their corresponding critical values do not need to increase simultaneously for  to decrease. For example  some  functions corresponding to haplotypes with low frequencies can be negligible in expression (4). Hence  if  increases sufficiently   will decrease. It can be shown that  will increase if  increases and that these two quantities share almost the same pattern for their expected values [see Additional file ]. Thus  according to the  profiles in Figure    is expected to decrease as position  moves toward the QTL position. An important result for  is obtained when only two haplotypes are observed among the  possible haplotypes. In this case   reduces to a real function of one LD coefficient [see Additional file ]  i.e.: where  and  are terms independent of LD  and the minimum and maximum possible values for  are given by  and   respectively. If  we have: The minimum and maximum possible values for the critical value    of  are given by  and   respectively  if the tested locus and the QTL are monomorphic [see Additional file ]. In other words  the critical value of this function will always lie within the range of the LD coefficient when LD exist. In expression (5)  the coefficient  is always greater or equal to -8 for any other predictor  than IBS  since . For instance  AIP by construction assign positive values to  when haplotypes  and  share allele similarity. This property is even truer if  and  are very similar. In such cases  the highest rate of decrease for   with respect to the absolute deviation of  from   is thus induced by . Moreover  for such cases  we also have   which expresses a lower bound for  (i.e.   [see Additional file ]). Finally   if and only if . In other words  when LD between the haplotypes and the QTL alleles is complete  the matrix distance is equal to 0 if and only if  [see Additional file ]. The decreasing behavior of  between a tested position and a QTL for a substantial increase of LD is therefore deteriorated for AIP with continuous predictions in [ 0 1]. Hence  this result questions the behavior of AIP with continuous predictions in [ 0 1] in relation to LD  in the general case where  is greater than 2. Figures  and  show the distributions of the matrix distance for the six AIP against the local multiallelic LD. Figures  and  convey only local information for the case where the tested position is closest to the QTL  as opposed to Figure . Darker and lighter blue regions in Figures  and  correspond to higher and lower density of points. The red lines in Figures  and  correspond to non-parametric LOESS regressions of the matrix distance on the multiallelic LD.  Darker and lighter blue regions correspond to higher and lower density of points. The red lines correspond to LOESS regressions of the matrix distance on the multiallelic LD.  Darker and lighter blue regions correspond to higher and lower density of points. The red lines correspond to LOESS regressions of the matrix distance on the multiallelic LD. Figures  and  show a better behavior of IBS  and P(IBD) for the decrease of their matrix distance  with lower variability around the LOESS curves compared to the other predictors  when the LD between the haplotypes and the target alleles increases. The distributions of the matrix distance for IBS  and P(IBD) in these figures show similar trends on the FLW and HCB chromosomes. This is due to the fact that these two predictors perform similarly in some conditions (see sub-section on mapping accuracy and relative efficiency). However IBS  shows a better behavior compared to all other predictors in Figures  and   for the decrease of its matrix distance with increasing multiallelic LD. The good behavior of IBS  for the decrease of its matrix distance in Figures  and  is totally explained by equation ()  where the sum of the concave polynomials decreases as the multiallelic LD increases. The better behavior of IBS   compared to the other predictors in Figures  and   is explained by equations () and ()  which show that continuous predictions in [0 1] will deteriorate the decrease of the matrix distance with respect to LD. The matrix distances for Beagle and IBS  were also plotted against the local multiallelic LD between the haplotypes and the target alleles in Figures  and   although these two predictors are defined for marker positions only. Indeed  one of the aims of this study was to compare the AIP based on local LD between haplotypes and alleles at a hidden locus. TP  Score  Beagle and IBS  showed poor relationships for the decrease of their matrix distance with the increasing multiallelic LD. The matrix distance distributions showed high variability for these predictors with respect to  on the FLW and HCB chromosomes. Note that the length of the six marker haplotypes on the HCB chromosomes were equal to 0.01 cM  on average  compared to 0.31 cM on average for those on the FLW chromosomes. Table  relates the relative efficiency of the six AIP that were compared  and their mapping accuracies  for a QTL simulated under six scenarios on the FLW chromosomes for =200 simulations.  in Table  corresponds to the multiallelic LD at position   measured between the marker-haplotypes that harbor the simulated QTL and the QTL alleles. Note that the tested position  does not necessarily coincide with the QTL position. Thus   can be defined as the tested position closest to the simulated QTL. In Table   IBS mQTL refers to the IBS  predictor applied to the data set containing the causal variants. This situation was examined as a gold standard. As shown in Table  and as expected  IBS mQTL provided the best mapping accuracy since the data set used contained the causal variants and both the simulated QTL and the analyzed markers were biallelic. However  it should be noted that the RMSE  for IBS mQTL was never equal to 0. This is principally due to the error term in the probabilistic models for hypothesis testing. RMSE  for IBS mQTL was also not equal to 0 when LD was highest (). This was due to a nearby marker which was in complete LD with the SNP that simulated the QTL (i.e. the biallelic LD was complete). Consequently the argument of the minimum (argmin) for the set of matrix distances was not unique. In Table  both RMSE  and RMSE  increased globally for all predictors when LD decreased in the vicinity of the QTL. RMSE  and RMSE  were highly correlated  regardless of the QTL effect. Across all LD levels  the Spearman correlation coefficient between these two quantities was equal to 0.89 (or 0.91) when the QTL effect explained at most 57% (or 8%) of the total variance  respectively (Figure ).                                                                                                            Each dot in Figure  represents RMSE  against RMSE  for one of the AIP at a particular LD level. In Table   the IBS  predictor was often the most accurate and efficient AIP when the data was analyzed without the QTL. However  the P(IBD) predictor showed similar mapping and efficiency results to IBS . As defined by []  the P(IBD) predictor relies on the IBS state of alleles between haplotype markers which suggests that IBS  and P(IBD) may perform similarly in some conditions []. Indeed  the distribution of IBD probabilities in the vicinity of a simulated QTL was almost bimodal (0 or 1) among the different pairs of chromosome segments for the different sets of simulations  and thus similar to the distribution of the values for IBS  between the segments. To illustrate this phenomenon  Figure  provides an example of distributions for the values of P(IBD) and IBS   for one gene-drop simulation  between pairs of chromosome segments around the simulated QTL for the moderate LD situation ().  The class width for the IBD probabilities is equal to 0.05. IBS  and P(IBD) also showed similar patterns at a set of tested positions for the matrix distances . Figure  shows an example for the mean and the sample quantiles at 2.5 and 97.5% for  at each tested position for the six AIP  from 200 gene-drop simulations with a QTL simulated for the moderate LD situation ().                                                                                                                                                                  As observed in Figure   the minima of the curves for the mean and the sample quantiles at 2.5 and 97.5% of the matrix distance distributions almost coincide with the QTL position for IBS  and P(IBD). For these two predictors  the three curves also show a smooth decreasing behavior as the tested position gets closer to the simulated QTL. This behavior shows the ability of IBS  and P(IBD) to capture LD structure along the chromosomes with respect to the simulated QTL  for different gene-drop simulations. It is interesting to note that IBS  and P(IBD) show similar patterns for the mean and the sample quantiles curves. However  the minimum of each of the three curves in Figure  is lower for IBS  than for P(IBD). Note that the patterns of the matrix distances for IBS  in Figure  are explained by equation () and Figure . That is  the matrix distance will decrease for IBS  due to the expected increase of the multiallelic LD  as the tested position moves toward the QTL position. In the same way  the patterns of the matrix distances for P(IBD) in Figure  are explained according to Figures  and . That is  P(IBD) will behave slightly differently from IBS   according to Figures  and   when taking equations () and () into account. As shown in Figure   the other predictors cannot capture the LD structure along the chromosomes with respect to the simulated QTL as well as IBS  and P(IBD); this is particularly the case for Score and even more for TP. For the latter two predictors   shows little variability and is low on average across the tested positions. This could explain the lack of a clear ranking between the mapping accuracies of TP and Score in Table . For Beagle  a good relative efficiency and mapping accuracy was observed for the lowest LD situation () in Table   compared to all the other predictors  when the QTL effect was low. Note that AIP that are based on haplotypes and that do not perform haplotype clustering like Beagle  may not be at an advantage for a low LD situation. For example  the matrix distance for IBS   as defined by equation ()  will not decrease if there is little LD between local haplotypes and QTL alleles. Therefore  haplotype clustering is necessary for such situations. Moreover  these AIP will intrinsically provide an excess of degrees of freedom for testing association if the QTL is biallelic  while not compensating for the low LD captured in the matrix distance. Hence  AIP based on haplotype clustering can provide higher mapping accuracy for low LD situations. The present study showed that the QTL mapping accuracy of AIP is highly correlated to the tested position that minimizes the matrix distance defined for comparison. The use of the matrix distance to compare various AIP has many advantages for methodology development and validation. First  it is independent of phenotype simulation processes and statistical tests that are commonly used to compare QTL mapping accuracy of different AIP [      ]. Indeed the phenotype simulation process  when based on certain specific assumptions  may favor some AIP over others: for example  IBD-based AIP might be at an advantage if the phenotypes are simulated only according to population history. The statistical test used may also favor some AIP  such as IBS   IBS  and Beagle  over others due to numerical stability when estimating variance components. As such  solving mixed model equations when covariance matrices are close to singularity due to AIP computation has been reported as an issue  and clustering strategies for haplotypes  which actually modify the properties of the AIP matrices  have been proposed to facilitate computation [  ]. The major drawback of the matrix distance approach is related to this advantage: a particularly efficient AIP or a particularly efficient haplotype size  identified from the matrix distance  that can not be used in association studies would be of no value. Another advantage of the matrix distance approach is that computation time is highly reduced compared to association studies  so numerous comparisons can be done. In the present study  the relative efficiency of the AIP was consistent with the results for QTL mapping accuracy  regardless of the QTL effects and LD patterns. Therefore  the concept of relative efficiency was proven useful to compare AIP and avoid time-consuming association studies on simulated data. Combining the relative efficiency with the mapping accuracy of predictors could also be helpful to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms in an association study. The results showed that the most accurate AIP for mapping were those that best captured LD between a tested position and a QTL. This was proposed from algebraic developments in the simplest situations and validated using real data and simulations. The matrix distance can be written for any AIP as a sum of functions of LD coefficients  and more precisely for the IBS  predictor as a sum of concave polynomials of LD coefficients. When LD was moderate to high around the QTL  the IBS  predictor was the most efficient and accurate matrix for mapping. For a biallelic QTL  the domains of values for which some of these concave polynomials can either decrease or increase with increasing LD was shown in our developments as limited to extreme allele frequencies for the haplotypes and QTL. Additionally  continuous AIP in [0 1] were shown to deteriorate the matrix distance generally when LD between a tested position and the QTL increased. This was observed on two unrelated data sets  which showed that this behavior is not related to the marker density or population history. All LD measures are based on counting occurrences for discrete events at distinct loci to quantify non-random association [  ]  which thus explains the algebraic and simulation results for discrete and continuous AIP when a relatively high LD is available for detection. The pig example was built using 235 haplotypes and 25 gene-drop generations  a realistic situation with regard to the effective population size. However  the impact of the resulting long-range haplotypic identity  which depends strongly on the population size and mating strategies  on the relative values of the considered AIP should be investigated. Despite using two contrasting data sets in terms of marker density and population history  P(IBD) always behaved very similarly to IBS . When extending the calculations to longer haplotypes (results not shown)  a similar behavior was observed. Yet advantages have been reported for P(IBD) compared to IBS  in some situations. For example  Roldan [] showed better accuracy for P(IBD) compared to IBS   after a clustering step for haplotypes when marker intervals were equal to 0.05 cM between SNPs  but not when they reached 0.25 cM. However in Roldan []  different statistical models were applied to P(IBD) versus IBS  (mixed model  fixed effects model respectively). Hence  these two AIP were not compared on the same basis. For instance  Boleckova [] showed that statistical models in which haplotypes were fitted as random effects performed better than those in which they were fitted as fixed effects. When both LD and the QTL effect were low  Beagle showed a relatively good efficiency and mapping accuracy. It was not possible to derive algebraical comparisons between AIP when LD was low  but this  together with earlier studies that point out that continuous advanced methods are more efficient than simple IBS   suggests that some continuous AIP in [0 1] may provide efficiency when LD between markers and a QTL is reduced. In the present study  we considered a biallelic QTL for algebra and simulations. Yet the algebraic derivation of the matrix distance can be generalized to a multiallelic QTL without difficulty [see Additional file ]. As suggested by these developments  for a multiallelic QTL  the relationship between continuous predictions of allelic identity at a tested position and the corresponding LD coefficients will tend to be looser than for discrete predictions. In addition  the matrix distance for the IBS  predictor can always be written as a sum of concave polynomials of LD coefficients for any degree of allelism at the QTL. The IBS  predictor can always capture multiallelic LD between a tested position and a QTL  regardless of the degree of allelism at the QTL. The IBS  predictor also has the advantage of being simple  fast and numerically stable when used in association studies. Therefore  it is suggested that  for studies with a high density of markers and for which LD between markers and the causal variants is likely to be high  the use of the IBS  predictor is recommended.

The chicken is an important animal for several reasons. In addition to being a major source of protein in the world  it is valuable to the understanding of genome evolution because of its relationship to mammals. The chicken genome sequence assembly was completed in 2004 with a six-fold whole genome shotgun (Sanger) coverage. It was the first avian genome to be sequenced [] and  therefore  holds a place in comparative genomics as a prototypic avian genome. Subsequent sequencing and mapping have improved upon that first build  and efforts continue in search of missing and/or unassembled sequences  primarily on the smaller microchromosomes and the sex chromosomes. Nevertheless  sequence segments remain misplaced in the genome assembly [] or unmapped. Radiation hybrid (RH) panels are useful mapping tools to determine the location and order of genes  and to aid the assembly of genome sequences. RH panels are available for several domestic animal species including cow []  pig []  horse []  dog []  cat []  mouse []  chicken [] and duck []. The ChickRH6 radiation hybrid panel was produced in 2002 [] and has been used to construct consensus chromosome RH maps of the chicken genome and a limited number of chicken or GGA () chromosome maps have been published to date  namely GGA2 []  GGA4 []  GGA5 []  GGA7 []  GGA14 []  GGA15 []  GGA16 [] and GGA25 []. NK-lysin is a cationic peptide with antibacterial activity that was originally isolated from porcine intestinal tissue. Extensive research has been conducted on the structure and antimicrobial activities of NK-lysin isolated from different species [–]. The chicken  gene was cloned in 2006 []  and its antimicrobial activity against  was reported []. Previously  we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the chicken  gene and discovered that the encoded protein variants are differentially cytotoxic for several bacteria and cell lines derived from human cancers []. However  to date the location of  on the chicken genome remains unknown. Here  we used the ChickRH6 panel to map the  gene on the chicken genome  and also examined its polymorphism and allele distribution among diverse heritage breeds and inbred lines of chicken. Different heritage chicken breeds available publically and several experimental inbred lines were surveyed. The heritage chicken breed samples came as pooled blood from eight to 26 animals  each. Three to seven individual samples were used for each inbred line. DNA (50 ng) was used for PCR amplification with a forward primer of cNKL QF3 and reverse primer of cNKL QR2 (Table )  and Sanger sequencing was carried out with the BigDye Termination kit  version 1 (ABI  Foster City  CA). To estimate allele frequencies from pooled blood samples  mixtures of known amounts of pure A and G allele DNA at ratios of 1:0  3:1  2:1  1:1  1:2 and 0:1 were prepared as a standard reference for quantitative PCR products. The peak area and heights were measured to approximate the ratio of alleles in pooled DNA from the heritage breed samples. The chicken  gene was physically mapped using the INRA Chicken RH panel (ChickRH6) containing 90 hamster-chicken hybrid cell lines []. DNA from each line  along with control chicken and hamster DNA  were analysed for the presence or absence of  and other markers by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in 96-well microtiter plates. PCR was performed with the primers listed in Table . The PCR reactions were conducted with an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 5 min  followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s  62°C for 30 s  72°C for 30 s  and a final elongation step of 5 min at 72°C. Each marker was run at least twice on the RH panel to insure reproducibility. The amplified product was typed and scored as present (1)  absent (0)  or ambiguous (2) as previously described []. Chromosome assignment was done and mapping was performed by including our genotyping data in a larger dataset composed of 10 143 markers for the chicken genome. This dataset is composed of 2663 markers (genes and microsatellites) from the ChickRH database () and 7480 SNPs genotyped on the ChickRH panel using the Illumina GoldenGate assay at the Centre National de Génotypage (CNG)  Evry  France. RH mapping was conducted using the Carthagene software []. We assumed random breakage along the chromosomes and equi-probable retention of fragments. RH map was constructed in three steps: (1) a two-point analysis identified markers linked together with a LOD score greater than 8 and defined RH groups from these data; (2) using all the markers from the linkage group corresponding to GGA22  multipoint analyses were done to build a framework map using a LOD threshold of 3; and (3) additional markers were added by calculating their location relative to the framework markers. Finally the map design was created using MapChart 2.0 []. Previously  we identified a SNP at nucleotide 271 of the  coding sequence and discovered that the encoded protein variants have different cytotoxicities for bacteria and anticancer activity []. Here  we genotyped this SNP among 32 heritage breeds and 10 inbred lines. The DNA from the heritage breeds was obtained from pooled blood samples from eight to 26 animals. We compared the A and G peak heights based on the sequencing chromatogram to estimate allele frequency (Figure ). A single A peak was detected in eight breeds and a single G peak was detected only in two of the 32 breeds (Table ). Twenty-two of the 32 breeds analysed by pooled DNA revealed peaks for both A and G alleles. Eleven breeds showed A and G chromatogram peaks of similar height  indicating that the frequencies of the A and G alleles in the pooled DNA were approximately equal. Seven samples had a peak at least twice as high for allele A than for allele G. Only four of the 22 breeds carried G as the major allele. Thus  the A allele is more common than the G allele across all tested heritage breeds (Table ).  DNA from homozygous chicken (A and G allele) was mixed in 1:0  3:1  2:1  1:1  1:2 and 0:1 A to G ratios and used as PCR template and sequenced; each chromatogram peak was compared to peaks from pooled DNA samples of heritage breeds and shows the estimated A to G ratio. We also genotyped 10 inbred lines  eight from single animals and two from five pooled individuals. The White Leghorn line 6  Fayoumi M-5.1 and Fayoumi M-15.2 carried the G allele  while White Leghorn line 7  Leghorn Ghs-6  Leghorn Ghs-13  Spanish 21.1 and Leghorn line 8–15.1 carried the A allele. Two pooled inbred lines  line 0 and line 15Is  had the A allele (Table ). There was no evidence of heterozygosity in any of the tested inbred lines. Thus  the A allele which has the higher antimicrobial activity was more common than the G allele across all tested heritage breeds and inbred lines. In the Gallus_gallus-4.0 Primary Assembly  the unmapped contig NW_003779909 contains the chicken  along with two additional genes   () and  (). We used the 6000 rad ChickRH6 panel to physically map the  gene in the chicken genome. A retention frequency (RF) of 27.7% for  was observed based on 25 positive PCR bands across the ChickRH6 panel. This RF value is within the range (6.8% - 55.7%) observed in other studies reported for this panel [    ]. Using two-point analysis  the  gene was included in a linkage group of 104 markers corresponding to microchromosome GGA22. After multipoint analysis  the framework map was composed of 23 markers covering 351.8 cR. Three additional markers    () and  () were integrated at their best possible locations on the comprehensive map (Figure ).    The GGA22 RH map (left) is 352 cR long and is aligned to the chicken genome assembly (right); the location of the  gene is indicated at the distal end of chromosome GGA22. SNPs are probably the most abundant genetic variants in animal genomes and these variations can be associated with or even underlie phenotypic traits  including disease susceptibility. Previously  we identified a SNP at nucleotide 271 of the  coding sequence and discovered that the encoded protein variants have different properties and also different cytotoxicities for bacteria and anticancer activity []. The objective of this study was to map the  gene in the chicken genome and to evaluate the distribution of the SNP alleles in common chicken breeds and inbred lines. Some breeds or lines were available only as pooled DNA from multiple animals of that line. However  quantitative analysis of pooled DNA samples is recognized as a legitimate approach to approximate allele frequencies of SNPs []. Thus  we analyzed the peak area and height of sequencing chromatograms and compared these to a reference standard of known amounts of mixed A and G allele DNA. Since allele frequencies can only be estimated  we are unable to conclude that any breed or line is fixed for either the A or G allele. We can  however  predict very low frequencies of the minor allele in breeds for which we only detected a single peak. These analyses revealed that the A allele is more common than the G allele across all tested heritage breeds and inbred lines. RH mapping analysis revealed that the  gene is located in the distal region of chromosome GGA22. The RH map produced here is in agreement with the sequence assembly over the length of GGA22  extending it slightly with the addition of . Chromosome GGA22 is a microchromosome  approximately 4 Mb long. Microchromosomes represent about one-third of the total avian genome size  and have been found to have a higher gene density than macrochromosomes []. Because microchromosomes are not easy to identify cytogenetically and because they lack microsatellite markers  it is difficult to localize genes on specific microchromosomes. Thus  many of the small linkage groups in the chicken genome that have not been placed on the genetic map or genome assembly are assumed to be located on the microchromosomes []. RH mapping analysis revealed that the  gene was located very near to the  () gene on GGA22. Our data place   and the 10 kb contig NW_003779909  distal to   the most telomeric gene marker in the sequence assembly. Its location near the telomere may explain the previous difficulty in placing this contig in the assembled chicken genome sequence.  ()  the human counterpart of   is located on human chromosome 2 between the genes  (-protein B) and  (). This genomic organization is well conserved on cattle chromosome 11  pig chromosome 3  horse chromosome 15  chimpanzee chromosome 2 and dog chromosome 17. While there is no known  gene in the chicken genome  the  gene at the telomeric end of GGA22 is located on human chromosome 7 and bovine chromosome 4. The chicken contig NW_003779909 contains the genes    and   which are all three located on the same human chromosome 7 and bovine chromosome 4. Thus  a segment that contains these three mammalian genes is conserved in chicken  but the  gene disrupts the otherwise conserved synteny. Previous reports have described the cloning of the chicken  gene [] and its antimicrobial and anticancer activity [] but its location in the chicken genome was unknown. Here  we used ChickRH6 to localize the  gene in the chicken genome at the distal end of GGA22. Two additional genes   and   are located in the same NW_003779909 contig  and thus were also indirectly mapped to GGA22. Previously  we reported a functionally significant SNP in the  coding sequence of two different chicken breeds. Here  we examined this SNP among a large number of different inbred lines and heritage breeds and found that the A allele  which has the higher antimicrobial activity  was more common than the G allele in our tested inbred lines and heritage breeds.

To date  polled cattle are obtained primarily by dehorning calves. Dehorning is a practice that raises animal welfare issues  which can be addressed by selecting for genetically hornless cattle. In the past 20 years  there have been many studies worldwide to identify unique genetic markers in complete association with the polled trait in cattle and recently  two different alleles at the  locus  both resulting in the absence of horns  were reported: (1) the Celtic allele  which is responsible for the polled phenotype in most breeds and for which a single candidate mutation was detected and (2) the Friesian allele  which is responsible for the polled phenotype predominantly in the Holstein-Friesian breed and in a few other breeds  but for which five candidate mutations were identified in a 260-kb haplotype. Further studies based on genome-wide sequencing and high-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping confirmed the existence of the Celtic and Friesian variants and narrowed down the causal Friesian haplotype to an interval of 145 kb.ResultsAlmost 6000 animals were genetically tested for the polled trait and we detected a recombinant animal which enabled us to reduce the Friesian  haplotype to a single causal mutation  namely a 80-kb duplication.

We conclude that the 80-kb duplication  as the only remaining variant within the shortened Friesian haplotype  represents the most likely causal mutation for the polled phenotype of Friesian origin. The bovine polled phenotype  i.e. the absence of horns  has huge practical importance for breeders and is of special biological interest to geneticists. Currently  the world cattle population is estimated to be about 1.3 billion heads [] of which a large proportion is horned. Although historical records indicate the presence of naturally polled cattle as far back as ancient Egypt [  ]  until recently  horned cattle remained the desired phenotype because it simplified tethering and attachment to harnesses. However  in modern husbandry systems  such practices are no longer used and the presence of horns increases the risk of injuries to handlers and animals  especially as the housing densities have increased. Thus  the presence of horns induces considerable economic losses in the cattle industry due to dehorning practices and the treatment of subsequent secondary infections  but also due to carcass and leather deterioration [  –]. Today  dehorning of cattle at an early age is common and although records are not exhaustive  there are probably more than 100 million calves that are dehorned each year. Since all dehorning methods are invasive and thus raise animal welfare issues  the possibility of breeding genetically polled cattle is a promising alternative [  ]. In addition  understanding the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the inhibition of the bovine horn bud differentiation will contribute knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie ectopic expression in mammals []. Since 1906  the polled phenotype is known to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait [] and the  locus was mapped to bovine chromosome 1 (BTA1 for ) in 1993 []. In the past years  the position of the  locus on BTA1 was refined [  ] and candidate causal mutations were identified [    ]. Recently  Medugorac et al. [] demonstrated the existence of at least two different alleles at the  locus in cattle. While a complex 202-bp insertion-deletion (InDel)  referred to as P  was identified in various cattle breeds from Scandinavia  Scotland  England  the Channel Islands and France down to the Alpine region (thus also referred to as the Celtic allele P)  a 260-kb haplotype including five candidate mutations (three SNP: P  P  P; two InDel: P  P) was reported to be perfectly associated with the polled phenotype in the Holstein-Friesian breed (thus also referred to as the Friesian allele P) []. Further studies based on genome-wide sequencing and high-density SNP genotyping confirmed the existence of these Celtic and Friesian variants and narrowed the causal Friesian haplotype down to an interval of 145 kb [] that included only two of the five initial candidate mutations i.e. SNP P and InDel P. However  high-throughput sequencing of this 145-kb interval identified two new candidate variants i.e. SNPs P and P  and genotyping of an enlarged cattle breed panel revealed the presence of the Celtic allele in new breeds from Iceland  Scandinavia  UK  Ireland and France []. In 2013  Allais-Bonnet et al. [] provided evidence that introgression of the Friesian allele was ongoing in some French and German cattle breeds for which the Celtic allele was predominant and Glatzer et al. [] reported that SNP AC000158:g.1390292G<U+2009>><U+2009>A  hereinafter referred to as rs134968598  co-segregated perfectly with the  locus in a set of 443 Holstein-Friesian animals. This SNP is located within intron 3 of the  () gene and is close (1113 bp) to a SNP for which the most significant selection signature was observed in a group of polled cattle []. However  these two SNPs are located 378 kb from the above mentioned Friesian haplotype. This study aimed at (1) refining the 260-kb haplotype which  based on previous results  is associated with the polled phenotype of Friesian origin [] and (2) examining the co-segregation of SNP rs134968598 and the  locus in Holstein-Friesian cattle. These aims are highly interesting from a practical and economic point of view for the most important global cattle breed Holstein-Friesian. Identification of the causal candidate mutation in the Friesian haplotype will also contribute to decipher the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex developmental phenotype with allelic heterogeneity. No formal ethical approval was required  since no new tissue samples were collected for this study. Indeed  for most animals  the DNA samples from previous studies [  ] were in stock in our laboratory and the remaining DNA samples were obtained from routine testing (paternity and polled phenotype test) by appropriate cattle breeding organizations. A total of 5993 bovine individuals were genotyped for the Celtic allele P and for the two InDel mutations that flank the Friesian haplotype i.e. P and P (Figure A) using previously described methods []. A small proportion of these animals was also genotyped for the three other mutations in the Friesian haplotype i.e. (i) animals that were shown to carry both the Celtic and the Friesian alleles on two different chromosomes (~1.2%)  (ii) animals that were recombinant within the Friesian haplotype (~0.02%) and (iii) a few animals that displayed an initial ambiguous genotyping result (~1.5%). To refine the Friesian haplotype  we included the two recombinant animals and all their available ancestors and relatives  which constituted a pedigree of 13 genotyped Holstein-Friesian animals (Figure B).  Relative position of the candidate mutations for the polled phenotype of Celtic (P) and Friesian (P) origin. All reference sequence (RefSeq) alleles are shown in blue and  candidate mutations in orange. The insertion-deletion events (P  P and P) are presented as bars and SNPs as lines. Note that this figure does not include the fairly distant SNP rs134968598 at position 1 390 292 bp.  Pedigree of 13 Holstein-Friesian animals used to narrow down the interval containing the  mutation of Friesian origin. Color code is as above. The recombinant haplotypes of the ROSSI and ELBOY RED bulls are shown with the corresponding colors. Polled homozygous (PP) individuals are represented by solid circles (females) and squares (males); declared polled heterozygous animals (Pp) by half-filled symbols; horned animals (pp) by empty symbols; missing and ungenotyped individuals are marked with a diagonal line. To test the previously reported [] co-segregation of the  locus with SNP rs134968598  which is located outside of the 260-kb haplotype  we used 130 animals that were representative of the global polled and horned Holstein-Friesian cattle population. These 130 animals included animals that we also used to refine the Friesian haplotype and bulls that had already been analyzed in our previous study []. Of the 130 animals  69 were horned (pp)  54 were heterozygous polled (Pp) and seven were homozygous polled (PP). The  genotype of each polled bull based on progeny testing was available from the respective breeding organizations. The progeny test considered phenotypes of at least nine progeny per bull mated to horned dams. In our previous study  the region captured around the SNP P  one of the two new candidate SNPs reported by []  was sequenced by high-throughput sequencing  but the sequence coverage was low []. Therefore  this region was re-sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing [] using DNA samples from four horned animals for which  in the previous study  the sequence capture data suggested a discrepancy between the known phenotype and the expected genotype  although the coverage was too low to infer reliable genotypes. In order to refine the 260-kb haplotype that perfectly associates with the  locus of Friesian origin  we genotyped 13 Holstein-Friesian individuals (that formed a small pedigree with two recombinant bulls and 11 relatives) for the Celtic allele P and the four Friesian variants P  P  P and P as described in Medugorac et al. []. Furthermore  of the two additional Friesian SNPs P and P reported in Allais-Bonnet et al. []  we included only the candidate causal mutation P because preliminary Sanger sequencing results indicated that P segregated in horned animals. Thus  the 13 Holstein-Friesian individuals were also genotyped for P using PCR-RFLP. Therefore  PCR products of the region around P were amplified using the primers reported in []  digested with the restriction enzyme  and the digestion products were size-separated by electrophoresis on a 2% ethidium-bromide stained agarose gel. The 130 animals  including those used to refine the haplotype  were genotyped for the recently published mutation within the gene  (rs134968598) as described in Glatzer et al. []. Recently  Glatzer et al. [] reported that SNP rs134968598 co-segregated with the  locus in a set of 443 (15 PP  71 Pp  357 pp) Holstein-Friesian animals []. In our study  genotyping of 130 animals representative of the global polled and horned Holstein-Friesian cattle population (7 PP  54 Pp  69 pp) for SNP rs134968598 revealed discrepancies between the progeny-based genotypes and the SNP-based genotypes at the  locus in seven cases (see Table ). Of the 69 genotyped horned individuals ( genotype pp)  67 were homozygous G/G for rs134968598 as expected according to [] but two bulls were heterozygous A/G. Of the 54 proven heterozygous polled (Pp) bulls  51 were heterozygous A/G and three were homozygous G/G. Finally  five of the seven proven homozygous polled bulls (PP) were homozygous A/A  but two were heterozygous A/G. In conclusion  ~5% of the genotypes at SNP rs134968598 are inconsistent with the previously reported perfect co-segregation between this SNP and the  locus in Holstein-Friesian cattle. Similar to Glatzer et al. []  our sample of 130 animals was representative of the global Holstein-Friesian population (i.e. from Canada  the Czech Republic  Denmark  France  Germany  Italy  the Netherlands and the United States of America) and among the polled individuals that exclude SNP rs134968598  some are major breeding bulls like the homozygous polled PREMIUM PP bull which has been extensively used in recent years. After our genotyping data excluded the rs134968598 SNP on BTA1 at position 1 390 292 bp as a candidate mutation  we re-analysed our sequence capture data and partly re-sequenced a region around the P candidate mutation of the 145-kb haplotype of Friesian origin reported in Allais-Bonnet et al. []. Several horned animals were found heterozygous C/T at SNP P and thus this SNP was also excluded as a candidate mutation. In order to refine the Friesian haplotype  which contains the causal mutation for the polled trait in most Holstein-Friesian breeding lines  a small pedigree including two recombinant bulls and relatives (Figure B) was genotyped for the six known polymorphisms in this region P P  P  P  P and P (for physical positions (according to UMD3.1) see Figure A). ELBOY RED  a horned male offspring of LAWN BOY P-RED  is a recombinant between P and P which excludes P and P as well as the fairly distant rs134968598 SNP as candidate mutations for the polled phenotype. Previously  we reported and confirmed this recombination in 20 horned offspring of ELBOY RED []. A second horned offspring of LAWN BOY P-RED  the recombinant bull ROSSI  carries a large region of the Friesian haplotype that is associated with the polled trait and that comprises P  P  P and P (Figure A and B). The genotyping data of ROSSI located the recombination event in an interval of 53 kb between P and P (beginning at g.1909352) and clearly excluded P  P  P and P as candidates for the polled phenotype of Friesian origin. Finally  based on the combined sequencing and genotyping data from our previous studies [  ] and this study  the only remaining causal candidate within the Friesian  haplotype is the 80-kb duplication P. This conclusion is inconsistent with that of Glatzer et al. [] who reported the existence of a progeny-proven heterozygous polled Holstein-Friesian sire that carried neither the P mutation nor a Celtic mutation. Unfortunately  since the identity of this bull was not provided  we could not verify these results. However  our personal experience from different previous analyses that we carried out is  that reliable genotyping of P and P is not trivial and that the genotyping-procedure should be validated using anonymous samples. Thus  there is a possibility that the bull reported in [] does carry either P or P. In addition  even if we had demonstrated the absence of both P and P in the genome of this bull further analyses would still have been necessary to show that it does not carry another spontaneous mutation  which could be responsible for a dominant horn defect syndrome. Such mutations have been reported to occur and can be confused with the regular  locus [    ]. Therefore  the existence of a new candidate mutation at the  locus of this animal should first be investigated and supported by linkage analyses on its relatives before refuting the highly probable causality of P for the polled phenotype in Holstein-Friesian cattle. Based on the genotypes of almost 6000 animals  we identified two bulls with a recombination within the 260-kb Friesian haplotype and narrowed this haplotype down to an interval of 53 kb on BTA1. Moreover  the results from these two recombinant bulls and related individuals disagree with the perfect association between the  locus and a SNP within intron 3 of the  gene previously reported by Glatzer et al. []. Combining the exhaustive sequencing data and high-density SNP genotyping results from previous studies [  ] and those reported here  we provide evidence that supports the P mutation as the only remaining and most likely causal mutation for the polled phenotype of Friesian origin. In addition to P  P (the  mutation of Celtic origin) segregates in some Holstein-Friesian families and sporadically combines in some homozygous polled but heterogeneous (P/P) animals (Figure B). Neither P nor P are located in any known coding regions [  ] but these mutations  even as single copy  result in the inhibition of horn development at a very early stage in cattle [  ]. Therefore  future investigations of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the inhibition of horn development in cattle will enrich our knowledge not only on the mechanisms that are involved in bovine horn bud differentiation but  also  more generally  on ectopic expression in mammals.

This is explained partly by differences in the standard deviation of gamete breeding values (SDGBV) between animals at the haplotype level. The SDGBV depends on the variance of the true effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the degree of heterozygosity. Haplotypes of 58 035 Holstein animals were used to predict and investigate expected SDGBV for fat yield  protein yield  somatic cell score and the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. Differences in SDGBV between animals were detected  which means that the groups of offspring of parents with low SDGBV will be more homogeneous than those of parents with high SDGBV  although the expected mean breeding values of the progeny will be the same. SDGBV was negatively correlated with genomic and pedigree inbreeding coefficients and a small loss of SDGBV over time was observed. Sires that had relatively low mean gamete breeding values but high SDGBV had a higher probability of producing extremely positive offspring than sires that had a high mean gamete breeding value and low SDGBV. An animal’s SDGBV can be estimated based on genomic information and used to design specific genomic mating plans. Estimated SDGBV are an additional tool for mating programs  which allows breeders to identify and match mating partners using specific haplotype information. Within the last years  dairy cattle breeding schemes have changed drastically with the availability of routine dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips. Initially  research focused mainly on estimation of genomic breeding values[–] and more recently  on imputation from low-density marker sets to denser marker sets[–]. In addition to genomic breeding values  other information can also be derived from dense marker information  such as parentage verification[]. In addition  VanRaden et al.[] identified haplotypes with genetic lethal effects that may lead to embryonic death in the homozygous state. Moreover  genetic characteristics such as horn status[] can be predicted with routine SNP information. In addition  genotyping large numbers of animals and dense SNP datasets makes it possible to characterize genetic variation at the chromosome and haplotype levels[  ]. Consequently  SNP haplotype information can be used to estimate the expected variance of breeding values at the gamete level. Variation between gametes is generated by random sampling of parental haplotypes during meiosis[] if the dam and/or the sire are heterozygous. Knowledge on the mean (MGBV) and standard deviation of gamete breeding values (SDGBV) assuming normally distributed estimated breeding values allows the development of specific mating plans. For example  the probability that the breeding value of an offspring exceeds a certain threshold can be estimated. In addition  it is possible to predict the number of animals to be tested to produce an offspring with an estimated breeding value above a given threshold. Cole and VanRaden[] discussed the possibility of selecting animals for which gamete breeding values vary little  in order to produce more homogeneous progeny and simplify herd management. Conversely  breeding companies may be more interested in heterogeneous progeny to increase the probability of extremely positive offspring. In line with this  experience with progeny-testing indicates that the use of popular sires with high estimated breeding values and many tested offspring does not guarantee that male offspring with superior breeding values are produced. In contrast  bulls for which fewer male offspring are tested sometimes produce more excellent offspring than popular bulls. The objective of this study was to predict and investigate the expected SDGBV using genomic information and to demonstrate its usefulness to improve mating decisions. A total of 58 035 Holstein animals genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA) obtained from routine genomic evaluation for German Holsteins[] (February 2013) were chosen for the study. Of the 50 k SNPs on this chip  43 586 autosomal SNPs that had a minor allele frequency greater than 1% were selected. The algorithm reported by Hayes[] was used to check whether genotype information agreed with the pedigree information. Only genotypes with a call rate greater than 98% were used. The software package Beagle (version 3.3 []) with default settings was used for imputation of missing marker genotypes and for phasing the genotypes. For this purpose  Beagle uses linkage disequilibrium at the population level. The order of the SNPs on the chromosomes was based on the UMD3.1 bovine genome assembly[]. Four traits (fat yield  protein yield  somatic cell score and the direct genetic effect for stillbirth) with different genetic architectures  heritabilities and genomic reliabilities were chosen. SNP effects were estimated with a BLUP model assuming trait-specific residual polygenic variance (for more details on the model see[]). The pedigree contained 58 035 genotyped animals (15 816 females and 42 219 males) and their 136 477 ancestors. All sires and dams of the genotyped animals were known. The animals were born between 1960 and 2013 and were descendants from 2768 different sires and 32 416 different dams. Genomic inbreeding coefficients were calculated by setting up the diagonal elements of the genomic relationship matrix  as suggested by VanRaden[]. Allele frequencies in the base population were estimated using the gene content method described by Gengler et al.[]. A scheme of the flow of information through the different steps of the estimation of MGBV and SDGBV is in Figure . First  the software package Beagle was used to phase the SNP genotypes and construct haplotypes. The haplotypes  SNP effects  and in order to define haplotype size  a map of recombination events were used to estimate haplotype specific breeding values (program hapDGV.f90). These results were the inputs for estimating MGBV and SDGBV (program genvar.f90). The resulting data and the pedigree and animal ownership information were then used for the mating software.                                                      MGBV and SDGBV were obtained by sampling different sets of transmitted haplotypes from the animals. In theory  with 29 autosomal chromosomes and ignoring the sex chromosome  there are 2 possible combinations of sampled haplotypes if the length of a haplotype is defined as one autosome and recombination is ignored. Assuming that  on average  one recombination occurs per centiMorgan  there is a near unlimited number of possible combinations of haplotypes. Thus  to make the simulation computationally feasible and to reduce the number of haplotype combinations  the genome was divided into 1856 chromosome segments (C) according to positions in the genome where a high number of recombination events occurred. These recombination events were identified in a preliminary study (results not shown here) in which a whole genome map of the number of crossing-over events was derived by identifying phase switches between the haplotypes of the sires and the paternal haplotypes of their sons. In the first step of the simulation of the SDGBV within an animal (program hapDGV.f90)  the parental and maternal haplotype breeding values for each animal were calculated as: where h is the i haplotype  with j the indicator of maternal or paternal haplotype  z is the maternal or paternal allele of marker k  a is half of the estimated effect of the k SNP from routine genomic evaluation of German Holstein cattle[]  and n is the number of SNPs belonging to the i haplotype. Imprinting  dominance and epistasis were not considered in the simulation. In the second step  using the program genvar.f90  100 000 possible gametes were simulated by selecting either the maternal or paternal phase from an animal. At the beginning of the chromosome  the probability of selecting the maternal or paternal strand was equal to 50%. Location of cross-overs was implemented in the simulation based on a uniform distribution over the interval [0 C] (C being the number of chromosome segments). The mean recombination rate between the haplotype strands was set to 0.3  which is in line with the number of expected recombinations assuming one recombination per Morgan. The MGBV of a parent was calculated as: where N is the number of replicates of the simulation  H is the number of haplotypes  and h is the i parental or maternal haplotype breeding value. The SDGBV of a parent was calculated as: Correlations between traits were analyzed for MGBV and SDGBV to investigate relationships between traits. To study whether selection  which should result in increased inbreeding and homozygosity per generation  had an antagonistic effect on MGBV and SDGBV  correlations of SDGBV and MGBV with the genomic (F) and the pedigree (F) inbreeding coefficients were computed for each trait. Furthermore  MGBV and SDGBV were tested for normality. Results of the simulation were validated by reconstructing the paternally transmitted haplotype for each animal. Then the paternally transmitted haplotype breeding value was estimated  by summing the paternally transmitted haplotype  which in this case refers to haploid chromosomes  with half the estimated SNP effects. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the size of the progeny groups per sire needed for validation. The observed mean and standard deviation of the estimated breeding values of the offspring were compared with the mean and standard deviation obtained from the simulation and correlations were computed. Subsequent to the prediction of MGBV and SDGBV  specific matings were designed using newly developed mating software  which also includes animal ownership information and pedigree data. The expected mean breeding value of a potential offspring was calculated as: where mBV is the expected breeding value of an offspring based on the parental average estimated breeding values  MGBV is the estimated mean gamete breeding value of the sire  and MGBV is the estimated mean gamete breeding value of the dam. Standard deviation of breeding values of the progeny  assuming no covariance between sire and dam  was calculated as: where sBV is the expected standard deviation of breeding values within the potential offspring of the same mating  SDGBV is the standard deviation of gamete breeding values of the sire  and SDGBV is the standard deviation of gamete breeding values of the dam. In addition  the probability to obtain offspring with a breeding value over a given threshold was calculated assuming normally distributed breeding values and the number of matings to produce at least one offspring with an estimated breeding value over a given threshold was calculated using a binomial distribution. Figure  shows for each trait and animal the relation between MGBV and SDGBV. Average MGBV were equal to 0.36 genetic standard deviation (s) for fat yield  0.54 s for protein yield  0.22 s for somatic cell score  and 0.09 s for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. A mean SDGBV of 0.47 s was obtained for somatic cell score. The direct genetic effect for stillbirth had an average SDGBV of 0.25 s. All plots show the presence of animals with equal MGBV but significantly different SDGBV. For example  for protein yield  bulls with an MGBV of 1.8 s showed a maximum difference in SDGBV of 0.22 s.  Traits investigated were fat yield  protein yield  somatic cell score and the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. The red lines indicate means for MGBV and SDGBV. Each dot represents an animal. Table  contains the observed correlations between the MGBV for the four traits  the genomic (F) and the pedigree (F) inbreeding coefficients. The correlation between MGBV was 0.66 for fat yield with protein yield and 0.15 for somatic cell score with the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. Correlation of SDGBV was lower with F than with F. Correlations among SDGBV for the four traits are in Table . These correlations were lower than correlations among MGBV. Correlation between SDGBV was highest for fat yield with protein yield (0.41). Correlations between SDGBV for the other traits ranged from 0.05 to 0.13. For all traits  correlations between SDGBV and F were negative. Correlations between SDGBV and F were also negative for all traits and two to four times larger than correlations between SDGBV and F. The MGBV showed no difference between theoretical and sampled quintiles of the normal distribution function for any of the studied traits (results not shown). Figure  shows Q-Q plots for SDGBV for the four traits. The graphs indicate that the classes in the middle of the distribution were almost normally distributed for all traits. For the more extreme classes  especially for animals with a SDGBV for fat yield lower than 0.35 s  a substantial deviation from the normal distribution was observed.                                                      Changes in SDGBV over time are in Figure . Similar to Figure   the SDGBV was highest for somatic cell score. The SDGBV for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth was only half of the SDGBV for somatic cell score. All traits indicated a slightly negative trend of SDGBV over the last decades. Regression of SDGBV on birth year indicated that the decline in SDGBV was greatest for somatic cell score (-0.0012 s per year)  followed by fat yield (-0.00087 s per year).                                                      Table  shows a sensitivity analysis to determine the size of the progeny groups needed for validation. Sires with more than 150 offspring are a good compromise between size of the group of offspring and number of sires available. In this case  correlations between the observed real progeny variation with the simulated SDGBV were highest for fat yield (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.93)  followed by protein yield and somatic cell score (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.90)  while the direct genetic effect for stillbirth had the lowest correlation (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.78). Table  and Figure  show results from the mating of two bulls that have extremely different SDGBV for protein yield  with a poor  average and superior female from the population. In addition  Table  contains the probabilities of producing an offspring with a breeding value exceeding 0  1  2  3 and 4 s and the number of animals to be tested to produce at least one animal with a breeding value exceeding a fixed threshold. Resulting distributions of the potential offspring were quite different between the two bulls. Mating of bull 1 with an average cow of the population is expected to produce animals with the highest mBV  i.e. 2.36 s. The same mating of bull 2 will generate animals with a slightly lower expected mBV  i.e. 2.23 s. However  a bull that has the highest mean does not guarantee the highest probability of producing offspring with a breeding value greater than 3 or 4 s. In this case  bull 2 had the highest probability of producing such offspring  but its probability of having progeny with an extreme negative breeding value was also greater. Similarly  the number of animals to be tested to find at least one animal with a mBV higher than 2 s was highest for bull 2. To produce extreme animals with a gamete breeding value higher than 3 or 4 s  more progeny had to be tested for bull 1 than for bull 2. Choosing a poor or a superior dam instead of an average cow changed the mean breeding value of the potential offspring  but did not substantially change the likelihood of obtaining offspring with extremely low or high breeding values.  Two bulls (with MGBV equal to 1.81 s and 1.68 s and SDGBV equal to 0.29 s and 0.52 s  respectively) are mated with an average female of the population (MGBV equal to 0.55 s  SDGBV equal to 0.39 s). The objective of this study was to predict the expected genetic standard deviation within groups of offspring using real data. The results indicate that gamete breeding values vary between animals and these results can be used to make specific mating decisions. MGBV and SDGBV for direct genetic effect for stillbirth were about half as high as for the three other traits (Figure  and Figure )  which is related to differences in the reliabilities of the direct genomic breeding values (DGV) between these traits. The reliability of DGV for fat and protein yields is equal to 69% and for somatic cell score to 74%  but only 44% for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth[]. Accordingly  the SNP effects for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth are more regressed to the mean than for the other traits. In comparison to the SNP-effect reference population  high MGBV for protein and fat yields can be explained by higher selection intensities and genetic gains than for somatic cell score and the direct genetic effect for stillbirth. Comparing the three different traits with similar reliabilities indicates that protein yield had the highest MGBV but the lowest SDGBV. This is explained by a higher selection intensity for protein yield  which is caused by a higher weight on this trait in the German Total Merit Index[]. However  up to now most genotyped animals are elite animals  which means that the genotyped animals are highly preselected. From this point of view  the high MGBV for protein and fat yields may not represent the mean breeding value of the German Holstein population. In contrast  MGBV for somatic cell score and for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth are closer to the mean value of the population since these traits are not as relevant for selection. Similarly  Cole and Null[]  pointed out that most genotyped animals are elite animals  which have more chromosomes with a desirable DGV than chromosomes with an undesirable DGV. Negative correlations between F and SDGBV (Table ) are in agreement with[]. These authors reported a stronger correlation of the Mendelian sampling variance (similar to the square of SDGBV) with F than with F  which is caused by pedigree errors. For animals with a low standard deviation of fat yield  the Q-Q plot (Figure ) showed a high divergence between the theoretical normal distribution and the sampled distribution. Cole and Null[] indicated that mutations with large effects like [] should explain a higher proportion of the genetic variance than the expected variance based on the relative length of the chromosome. To check if the  locus has an effect on the distribution of SDGBV  two scenarios were analyzed (Figure ). In the first scenario  the SDGBV for fat yield was predicted including all 43 586 SNPs. Results showed a bivariate distribution with SDGBV ranging from 0.25 to 0.6 s. In the second scenario  haplotypes in a region of 2.2 Mbp surrounding the  locus were excluded from the SDGBV prediction. Under this scenario  SDGBV showed a normal distribution with a lower mean and lower range than for scenario 1. This indicates that the SDGBV for a specific trait depends on its genetic architecture. The larger the effect on the trait and the more the allele frequency of this mutation is close to 0.5  the higher is the influence on the SDGBV  which results in a deviation from the normal distribution. Thaller et al.[] reported an allele frequency of 0.55 for Holstein animals for the lysine-encoding variant (K232A) of the  gene. Furthermore  for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth  several investigations[  ] have indicated the presence of a quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 18 with a high influence on calving traits. Haplotype analyses demonstrated that a haplotype of 19 SNPs explains 16% of the estimated breeding value variance for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth (results not shown here). However  the influence of this QTL on SDGBV for direct genetic effect for stillbirth was less than the effect of  on the SDGBV for fat yield. Differences in allele frequencies of the  gene and of the QTL for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth might explain these findings.                                                                                                            Simulated SDGBV can only be validated for sires that have large groups of offspring. A validation independent from genomic information is only possible by comparing the SDGBV of a bull with the standard deviation of the phenotype-based estimated breeding values of its sons. However  only some very popular sires have a large number of offspring with phenotype-based estimated breeding values. Using genomic information  many animals can be tested at a relatively low cost compared to the costs of progeny-testing of bulls  which makes it possible to investigate the standard deviation of genomic breeding values within groups of offspring. Another approach to investigate and validate the standard deviation within groups of offspring is to use daughter yield deviations corrected for the contribution of the dam. One benefit of this approach is that many sires have very large groups of female offspring because of artificial insemination. Figure  shows the trend over time of the mean haplotype breeding values that progeny inherit from their sire and dam. Results show a near linear trend for fat and protein yields  but the paternal haplotype had a higher intercept and steeper slope than the maternal haplotype. An interesting point is the decrease in paternal MGBV for birth year 2003. Analysis of the 2002  2003 and 2004 tested birth cohorts (650 bulls per year) also indicate a decrease in mean breeding values for fat yield (0.33 s  0.25 s  0.43 s) and protein yield (0.55 s  0.46 s  0.71 s) for the 2003 birth cohort. This decrease is mainly caused by the offspring of three sires which pre-dominated in this birth year. On average  these groups had breeding values for fat and protein yields that were more than one s lower than the pre-dominating groups of offspring in the birth cohorts in 2002 and 2004. In contrast to the gamete breeding values for fat and protein yields  no clear difference in gamete breeding values between maternal and paternal haplotypes was found for somatic cell score until the 2010 birth year. From birth year 2010 to 2013  the paternal haplotype was superior to the maternal haplotype. One explanation is that more and more genomically selected sires were used to produce animals born between 2010 and 2013. In contrast  due to genotyping costs  many dams were not genomically selected  which results in lower genetic gain on the female side. For gamete breeding values for the direct genetic effect for stillbirth  there was no genetic trend for either maternal or paternal haplotype breeding values because the direct genetic effect for stillbirth does not seem to be a trait under intense selection. However  Figure  shows that for fat and protein yields there is a difference between sires and dams  which has to be taken into account in the validation. The gap between estimated sire and dam haplotype breeding values can be reduced by increasing genotyping and selection intensity in the dams-to-bulls and dams-to-cows selection paths.                                                      Systematic genotyping of young Holstein Friesian candidates started in 2010. This implies that animals born before 2010 were selectively genotyped because of their importance for the breeding scheme and their contribution to the reference population. The within-family variance of older families could be affected by this selective genotyping. Genotyping more animals results in larger groups of offspring from randomly genotyped sires  which should result in improved future validations. Van Raden et al.[] and Fritz et al.[] reported that some haplotypes are never present in the homozygous state  because embryos that are homozygous for these haplotypes are not viable. This fact and genetic defects like Brachyspina[  ]  Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (BLAD[]) or Complex Vertebral Malformation (CVM[]) also influence the SDGBV. However  the effect on the variation depends on the allele frequency in the population; thus a loss of variation can be observed only when sperm and ovum carry the same genetic defect. This fact can explain the difference between simulated and observed realized gamete breeding values  because the simulation did not consider loss of variation due to genetic defects. Indeed  gamete breeding values rather than animal breeding values were simulated and a carrier of a genetic defect had no influence on SDGBV if the mating partner did not carry this defect. Figure  shows that there are animals with a high mean and a low variability that are relevant for dairy farmers. In particular  animals with a high mean and a high standard deviation are interesting for AI companies because selecting these animals will increase the probability of producing animals with extremely positive breeding values in the future. Haplotype information enables the estimation of selection limits. Summing up the best breeding value for each haplotype will give the theoretically best animal. The gamete breeding values of these hypothetical animals should reach<U+2009>+30 s (707 kg) for fat yield  +32 s (539 kg) for protein yield  +35 s somatic cell score and<U+2009>+14.2 s for the direct effect of still birth. Cole and VanRaden[] showed that the selection limit for protein yield was 1138 kg. Although our results are estimated at the haplotype level and those of[] at the animal level  they are consistent. Theoretical mating of the two best animals for protein yield in our dataset would produce animals with a mean estimated breeding value of 4.82 s and a standard deviation of 0.76 s. The probability to produce an offspring with a breeding value higher than 8 s is 0.14%  which is only one third of the selection limit  which illustrates that animals from the current population are far from the selection limits. Figure  and Table  show that two different mating strategies can be designed based on knowledge about MGBV and SDGBV. On the one hand  AI companies are interested in finding extremely positive offspring and  from this point of view  mating bull 2 would be the best choice. On the other hand  farmers are more interested in homogeneous groups of offspring with low SDGBV  which means that mating bull 1 would be better for breeding in these herds. For computational reasons  no covariance between sire and dam was assumed to calculate the vBV. Thus  this method has to be improved because the German Holstein population has a small effective population size which increases the level of relationships and results in a non-zero covariance between sires and dams. Finding the best combination of mating partners in mating programs that are based on genomic information requires time- and memory-intensive computing because of the large amount of data. A great benefit of the method described in this study is that MGBV and SDGBV need to be computed only once for each animal. After this step  it is computationally easy to find mating partners because mBV or vBV is the sum of maternal and paternal MGBV or SDGBV  respectively. Calculating the probability that an animal reaches a defined threshold is simple using normal distribution functions. Based on this methodology  a software tool for breeding associations was developed  which includes MGBV and SDGBV for a portfolio of bulls of interest and for genotyped cows. Given this information  the association can specify which breeding value threshold the offspring of a given cow should exceed and the tool provides a list of bulls that are expected to reach this criterion. Decreasing genotyping costs makes it possible to genotype whole commercial herds[]. Considering MGBV and SDGBV derived from haplotypes and SNP effect estimates is only one example of the use of additional genomic information in genomic mating programs. Ongoing research will develop new tools such as the estimation of dominance effects[] or more information about haplotypes with specific genomic effects. Software solutions need efficient and highly performing programs  which can handle large amounts of data within a reasonable timeframe. The expected SDGBV of a potential parent can be estimated from genomic information. The SDGBV differs between animals and tend to be normally distributed in the absence of QTL with a large effect on the trait. For SDGBV for fat yield  a deviation from a normal distribution that is caused by the  mutation results in a higher SDGBV than expected. Furthermore  for all traits  SDGBV decreased slightly in recent years because of an increase in the level inbreeding. A genomic mating program was developed to find optimal mating partners with respect to expected MGBV and SDGBV. This approach also allows the probability of finding an offspring with a breeding value exceeding a chosen threshold to be calculated.

Cross-validation accuracy of predicted breeding values was higher with genomic models than with the pedigree model. Inclusion of dominance effects did not increase the accuracy of the predicted breeding and total genetic values. Additive and dominance SNP effects for milk yield and protein yield were estimated with a BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) model and used to calculate expectations of breeding values and total genetic values for putative offspring. Selection on total genetic value instead of breeding value would result in a larger expected total genetic superiority in progeny  i.e. 14.8% for milk yield and 27.8% for protein yield and reduce the expected additive genetic gain only by 4.5% for milk yield and 2.6% for protein yield.ConclusionsEstimated dominance variance was substantial for most of the analyzed traits. Due to small dominance effect relationships between cows  predictions of individual dominance deviations were very inaccurate and including dominance in the model did not improve prediction accuracy in the cross-validation study. Exploitation of dominance variance in assortative matings was promising and did not appear to severely compromise additive genetic gain."

Selection on total genetic value instead of breeding value would result in a larger expected total genetic superiority in progeny  i.e. 14.8% for milk yield and 27.8% for protein yield and reduce the expected additive genetic gain only by 4.5% for milk yield and 2.6% for protein yield. Estimated dominance variance was substantial for most of the analyzed traits. Due to small dominance effect relationships between cows  predictions of individual dominance deviations were very inaccurate and including dominance in the model did not improve prediction accuracy in the cross-validation study. Exploitation of dominance variance in assortative matings was promising and did not appear to severely compromise additive genetic gain. Dominance arises when the effects of alleles at a locus are not only additive  but interact so that the value of the heterozygous genotypes deviates from the mean of the values of the homozygous genotypes. With  and – being the genotypic values of homozygous genotypes AA and AA  let  be the genotypic value of the heterozygous genotype AA[]. If <U+2009>=<U+2009>0  there is no dominance action at the locus and the genotypic values at the locus are purely additive. The additive effects of genotypes at a locus are expressed as breeding values  which include part of the dominance effect because animals pass alleles  not genotypes  to their offspring. Breeding values are 2[<U+2009>+<U+2009>(-)] for genotype AA  (-)[<U+2009>+<U+2009>(-)] for genotype AA and -2[<U+2009>+<U+2009>(-)] for genotype AA  where  is the frequency of allele A in the population and  the frequency of allele A. The dominance deviation for a given genotype at the locus is the difference between genotypic value and breeding value  and is equal to -2  2 and -2 for genotypes AA  AA and AA  respectively []. Until recently  studies on dominance deviations were sparse because without genomic information  the availability of large datasets with sufficient proportions of individuals with non-null dominance effect relationships  such as full-sibs  is essential for accurate estimation of dominance variance. Estimates of dominance variance in dairy cattle that are based on pedigree data range from 7.3% to 49.8% of the total genetic variance for conformation traits [  ] and from 3.4% to 42.9% for milk production traits [–]. At the individual animal level  dominance is hardly used in animal breeding []  although it contains a relevant part of genetic variation. The reasons are the heavy computational demand of large-scale genetic evaluations for dominance  the relatively low accuracy of resulting estimates of dominance effects  and the complexity of planning and computing the outcome of planned matings []. With the availability of SNP genotypes  dominance at a marker locus can be readily determined  dominance effects of markers can be estimated [  ] and computing the expected outcome of planned matings based on SNP genotypes is straightforward []. Furthermore  covariance matrices of genomic dominance effects among individuals can be calculated  similar to matrices of genomic additive relationships  which are widely used in genomic selection  such that dominance effects can be estimated in a GBLUP (genomic best linear unbiased prediction) model [  ]. In this work  we explored the possibilities of including dominance effects in genomic evaluation and furthermore in planned matings in dairy cattle. We estimated variance components  including dominance variance  in a dataset of genotyped Bavarian Fleckvieh cows  analyzed the predictions of breeding and total genetic values using cross-validation  and predicted total genetic values of specific matings. First-lactating cows from 145 Bavarian dairy herds (all first-lactating cows of each herd were genotyped)  born in 2008 and 2009  were genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip that includes 777 962 SNPs. SNPs with a call rate lower than 0.9  a minor allele frequency higher than 0.005 and a highly significant deviation (<U+2009><<U+2009>10) from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  and SNPs that were not annotated (UMD3) on the autosomes or on the pseudo-autosomal region of the X-chromosome were excluded from the analysis. A total of 629 028 SNPs remained in the dataset after editing. High-density SNP genotypes and yield deviations (YD) for nine traits (milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  somatic cell score  milkability  stature  udder score  udder depth and feet and legs score) from 1996 Bavarian Fleckvieh cows were available to (a) estimate variance components  including dominance variance and (b) perform cross-validation in order to evaluate the predictive ability of a model with dominance effects in comparison to a purely additive model. Both studies were done within a GBLUP framework. YD were calculated based on test-day observations adjusted for non-genetic effects  but not for permanent environmental effects  for each lactation and interpolated by the method of best prediction [  ]. A weighted mean was calculated across lactation YD of a cow in order to obtain one multi-lactation YD per cow. The effective number of own performances (EOP) [] was provided as a weight for the multi-lactation YD. For conformation traits  a permanent environmental effect was not modeled because repeated measurements are not available for cows. Additive genetic () and residual () variance components were estimated with models MA and MG. where  is a vector of multi-lactation YD   is the overall mean   is a design matrix relating YD to breeding values   is a vector of breeding values of cows  and  is a vector of residuals. Covariance matrices of additive effects were  in model MA and  in model MG  where  is the numerator relationship matrix and  is the genomic relationship matrix. The genomic relationship matrix  was calculated based on the approach of VanRaden [] using PREGSF90 []: where matrix  has dimensions of the number of individuals () by the number of loci ()  with elements that are equal to 2-2 and -2 for opposite homozygous and 1-2 for heterozygous genotypes   is the minor allele frequency of locus   and  =1-. Matrix  was scaled so that the means of diagonals and off-diagonals are the same as in [  ] and then combined with  to <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>0.05  in order to improve numerical stability. The variance matrix of residual effects was  for both models  where  is a diagonal matrix with reciprocals of the EOP as weights. Extending model MG with dominance effects leads to model MGD: where  is a vector of dominance deviations of cows. V() and V() are defined as in model MG. The covariance matrix of dominance effects is  where  is the genomic dominance relationship matrix and  is the dominance variance. Matrix  was calculated as: where  has dimensions of the number of individuals () by the number of loci ()  with elements that are equal to  for genotype AA  2 for genotype AA  and  for genotype AA. Matrix  was then combined with the identity matrix  as <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95 <U+2009>+<U+2009>0.05  to improve numerical stability. Estimation of variance components was performed with REMLF90 []. Goodness of fit of the respective models to the data was measured by the likelihood. The superiority of model MGD over model MG was tested by a likelihood ratio test  which was calculated as -2ln(likelihood for MG)<U+2009>+<U+2009>2ln(likelihood for MGD). The likelihood ratio follows a mixture of <U+03C7>-distributions with 0 and 1 degree of freedom []. In addition  variance components of model MGD were estimated by Gibbs sampling using the GIBBS1F90 software [] in order to compare them with REML results and to calculate standard errors of the estimates. A total of 200 000 iterations of the sampler were run  with the first 20 000 iterations discarded as burn-in samples and every 50 sample included in the posterior analysis. Convergence to the final distribution was checked with the Geweke diagnostics [] of the R package coda [  ]. Additive and dominance variance components at the marker level ( and ) were also estimated with the GS3 software [] in a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm  using a model at the marker level (referred to as the MGD-SNP model hereinafter)  in contrast to the previous animal level models: where  and  are vectors of additive and dominant effects of the SNPs  and  and  are incidence matrices coded as {-1  0  1} and {0  1  0} for the three possible genotypes. The assumed variance-covariance structure was  and . From the resulting estimates  additive and dominance variance components on the animal level were calculated as: and []. A total of 300 000 iterations of Gibbs sampling were performed for each trait. The first 20 000 iterations were discarded as burn-in samples and from the remaining 280 000 every 50 sample was considered for analysis of the posterior distribution. Genotyped cows with YD for the respective traits were randomly divided in ten groups in order to perform cross-validation analysis. Typically  splitting at random implies that some validation animals have descendants in the training dataset  which means that the cross-validation is based on descendants  a case of no interest in reality and which will inflate accuracies []. In our dataset  genotyped cows were from a single generation. Therefore  a predicted cow could not have daughters (but  e.g.  half- or full-sibs) in the training dataset – hence limiting upward bias in the estimation caused by progeny of validation animals in the training data. In this setting  the cross-validation accuracy measures the accuracy to predict contemporary cows including half- and full-sibs of training cows. Each group served once as validation group and the calibration group consisted of the other nine groups. Breeding values and total genetic values for the validation group were predicted based on models MA  MG  and MGD with their respective variance components estimated with REMLF90. The correlation between predicted breeding values and YD in the validation group [] was calculated  as well as the regression of YD on predicted breeding values []. For model MGD  the correlation between predicted total genetic values and YD [] and the regression of YD on predicted total genetic values [] were also calculated. These measures were averaged over the ten validation groups. Genotype probabilities and expectations of purely additive breeding values () and total genetic values ()  that include dominance deviations  were calculated for the offspring of all possible matings between 1996 cows and 50 bulls for milk yield and protein yield. The bulls were genotyped and selected for the respective trait on their conventional breeding value after progeny test (including the records of 1996 genotyped cows) from the German-Austrian genetic evaluation. SNP effects  and  were estimated in a BLUP model (BLUP-SNP; equal to model MGD-SNP but with variance components known) using GS3. Variance components  and  were fixed to values calculated from REMLF90 variance components  and  (model MGD): The total genetic value  of progeny from a mating between bull  and cow  was predicted as in Toro and Varona []: where () is the probability of the corresponding genotype at locus . Analogously  the breeding value  of progeny from a mating between bull  and cow  was predicted as: where  Matings can be selected on  to maximize additive genetic gain or on  to maximize total genetic superiority. The latter maximizes the productive performance of the offspring  which might be a farmer’s interest. However   can be maximized only for the next generation because gain in the dominance part of  cannot be accumulated in subsequent generations. In our example  additive gain is assured by pre-selection of bulls on their conventional breeding value. Selection on  leads to maximum additive gain  which can be accumulated in subsequent generations  and thus optimizes cumulative multi-generational genetic gain. A desirable objective might be to maximize  of matings and at the same time to keep the expected  of the offspring as high as possible. In order to compare the results of these two possible selection strategies   and  of all possible matings between the 1996 cows and 50 bulls were calculated for milk and protein yields. For each cow  the top mating was selected with respect to  or   with the restriction that a single bull was not mated to more than 200 cows. The expected additive genetic gains and total genetic superiorities with selection on  or  were calculated as the difference between the mean  or  of selected matings and the mean  or  of all possible matings. Figure  shows the histograms of off-diagonal elements of the additive and dominance genomic relationship matrices. Means of off-diagonals of  (before scaling) and  were equal to 0  which implies that the population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The standard deviation of off-diagonals of  was equal to 0.036  which is five times larger than the standard deviation of off-diagonals of   i.e. 0.007. The proportion of off-diagonals that were smaller than -0.05 or larger than 0.05 was 6.27% for  but only 0.02% for . Therefore  matrix  was less informative than .                                                      Estimated variance components for model MGD are in Table . Dominance variance (expressed as a percentage of total genetic variance) for milk production traits ranged from 28.1% for fat yield to 40.9% for protein yield. For somatic cell score and milkability  dominance variance was estimated at 39.0 and 50.5% of the genetic variance. Estimates of dominance variance for conformation traits were quite small  except for udder depth  ranging from 3.3% for stature to 15.3% for feet and legs score. For udder depth  dominance variance was estimated at 23.8% of the genetic variance. For comparison  additive variances estimated with models MA and MG are also in Table . With the exception of milkability  the estimates of additive variance from model MG were consistent with additive variance estimates from the dominance model. Estimates of additive variance obtained with the pedigree model MA differed to some extent from those obtained with the genomic models. Estimates of variance components obtained using Gibbs sampling with model MGD and with an equivalent MGD-SNP model are in Table  and were similar to REML estimates with model MGD. Geweke statistics [] showed convergence for model MGD but for the MGD-SNP model  the Gibbs chains did not converge even after 300 000 iterations. However  the means of the Gibbs chains for the MGD-SNP model were similar to those for the MGD model. For stature  udder score and feet and legs score  the estimated dominance variance was clearly larger with both Gibbs sampling analyses than with REML estimation because of a skewed posterior distribution of the Gibbs samples. Estimates of the ratio between dominance and total genetic variance had standard errors around 0.10  which is fairly good for such a small dataset. For all traits  model MG  which exploited genomic information  fitted the data better than model MA  which included pedigree information only. The superiority of model MGD  which included a dominance effect  compared to model MG was significant for milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  somatic cell score and milkability  based on the likelihood ratio test. Likelihood measures and statistics of the likelihood ratio test between models MG and MGD are in Table . The likelihood ratio test statistics were asymptotically <U+03C7>-distributed []. The <U+03C7>-distribution function can take only non-negative values because it is defined as a sum of squared values. For two traits (stature and udder score)  the likelihood ratio test statistics were negative (but very close to 0)  which was due to numerical rounding or not finding the mode of the likelihood exactly. Mean accuracies of predicted breeding values [] and slopes of the regression of YD on predicted breeding values [] are in Table . For model MA   ranged from 0.102 for somatic cell score to 0.228 for fat yield  with an average of 0.165. Replacing pedigree with genomic relationships increased  to between 0.108 (feet and legs) and 0.327 (milkability)  with an average of 0.242.  did not change when dominance effects were added to the model. Average standard errors of  were equal to 0.024  0.021 and 0.021 in models MA  MG and MGD  respectively.  with the dominance model ranged from 0.109 for feet and legs score to 0.325 for fat yield. The difference between  and  in model MGD ranged from -0.004 for protein yield to 0.003 for udder score. The standard errors of  were similar to those for   with a mean of 0.021. For models MA and MG   ranged from 0.563 (milkability) to 1.201 (feet and legs score) and from 0.744 (milkability) to 1.068 (fat yield)  respectively  with means of 0.964 and 0.971.  for model MGD ranged from 0.924 (protein yield) to 1.085 (fat yield)  with a mean of 1.016. The standard errors of  were rather large  with means of 0.151  0.106 and 0.111 for models MA  MG and MGD  respectively. The slope of the regression of YD on predicted total genetic values ranged from 0.889 (protein yield) to 1.060 (feet and legs score)  with a mean of 0.995 and was slightly smaller than  for most traits for the same model. The fact that slopes were generally not significantly different from 1 suggests that predictions were essentially unbiased  except for milkability. For milk yield  16 bulls were chosen as mating partners when matings were selected on . The restriction of at most 200 cows per bull was reached for seven bulls. The remaining nine bulls were mated to 197  147  139  86  19  4  2  1 and 1 cows. When matings were selected on   nine bulls were mated to the maximum number of 200 cows and two other bulls to 176 and 20 cows  respectively. For protein yield  24 bulls were chosen as mating partners when matings were selected on . The restriction of 200 cows per bull was reached for seven bulls. The remaining 17 bulls were mated to 134  115  114  63  62  29  26  21  8  7  4  3  3  3  2  1 and 1 cows. When matings were selected on   eight bulls were mated to the maximum number of 200 cows and the four other bulls to 190  157  33 and 16 cows. Expected total genetic superiorities and additive genetic gains obtained with the selected matings are in Table   both in absolute numbers and relative to the standard deviations (SD) of  and . When matings were selected on  for milk yield  the expected total genetic superiority was estimated to be equal to 165.2 kg  which is equivalent to 1.01 SD of . The expected total genetic superiority was reduced to 143.8 kg (0.88 SD) when matings were selected on . The expected additive genetic gain was less sensitive to the selection criterion applied since it was only slightly reduced when selection was done on  (137.7 kg; 0.85 SD) instead of on  (143.8 kg; 0.89 SD). The results were similar for protein yield. With selection on   the expected additive genetic gain was slightly smaller (0.74 vs. 0.76 SD) but the expected total genetic superiority was clearly larger (1.01 vs. 0.79 SD) compared to selection on . This study analyzed the importance of dominance variation for several milk production and conformation traits in the Fleckvieh breed using the GBLUP methodology. Additive and dominance genomic relationship matrices were calculated similar to Su et al. []  except that standard quantitative genetic approaches were used  with the dominance variance at locus  defined as (2)[  ]. This resulted in the reported estimates of dominance variance to be compatible with pedigree-based estimates. Independence between  and  is the classical treatment [] and it is convenient because it allows orthogonality of the estimates and thus an easy translation into variances and covariances of  and . However  this independence is contradictory with the phenomena of inbreeding depression and hybrid vigor; presence of inbreeding depression indicates that dominance is directional  e.g. []. Wellmann and Bennewitz [  ] reviewed biological information on milk yield and productive life in Holstein cattle to suggest  dependencies between  and  (which would result in dependencies between  and ) and Bayesian regression models that could accommodate those dependencies. The treatment of dependencies between breeding values and dominance deviations is rather complex and the computational requirements are large  thus  we did not consider this method although it should be a field of further research. Estimates of dominance variance varied from 3.3 to 50.5% of total genetic variance for the analyzed traits. Estimated dominance variance (as a percentage of total genetic variance) was greater for milk production traits than for conformation traits. These results agree with those of Misztal et al. []  who found larger dominance variance for production than for conformation traits. Moreover  Misztal et al. [] reported estimates of dominance variance in US Holstein cattle for 14 conformation traits that ranged from 7.3 (rump angle) to 22.3% (strength) of the total genetic variance. This is comparable to the estimates of dominance variance for the conformation traits analyzed in this study. In the literature  reported estimates of dominance variance for milk production traits of Holstein cattle vary considerably ranging from 1.4 to 42.9% of the total genetic variance [–]  which are within the same range but smaller than those found in our study. Two reasons may explain the relatively large estimates of dominance variance for milk production traits obtained in our study compared to values reported in the literature: (1) Fleckvieh cattle are genetically more diverse than Holstein cattle  as reflected by the considerably larger effective population size of the Fleckvieh breed []  which is expected to result in more heterozygosity and in QTL alleles with more intermediate frequencies; (2) all estimates of dominance variance available in the literature were obtained using relationship matrices based on pedigree data; the use of genomic information is expected to improve estimates of dominance effect relationships and reduce potential confounding with additive effects and residuals which is likely to result in different estimates. Although moderate changes in estimates of additive variance were observed between pedigree and genomic models  estimates of additive variance were consistent for genomic additive and dominance models  except for milkability. Su et al. [] reported a small difference in estimates of additive variance between additive and dominance models. However  the additive and dominance variances reported in Su et al. [] result from an alternative partitioning of genetic variance and are thus not directly comparable to the classical partitioning of genetic variance []. In studies based on pedigree information  estimates of additive variance have been similar between additive and dominance models [    ]. Both Gibbs sampling with model MGD and at the marker level with the MGD-SNP model resulted in estimated variance components that were comparable with REML estimates for most traits. The relative standard error (calculated as standard error divided by the estimate) of dominance variance was on average 2.7 times larger than the relative standard error of the estimated additive variance  which is expected based on the properties of  and . However  in other studies the ratio between relative standard errors of dominance and additive variances was even larger  i.e. 4.1 in Misztal [] and 4.5 in Su et al. []. In order to estimate dominance variance more accurately  more dominance-specific information is needed. This could be achieved  e.g.  by increasing the number of full-sibs in the dataset. The present dataset contained 3% full-sibs. Despite the large estimates of dominance variance for most analyzed traits (significantly larger than 0 for five traits)  prediction accuracy of breeding values and total genetic values did not change when dominance effects were included in the model. Estimates of additive variance did not differ much between models MG and MGD  which means that additive variance is already captured quite accurately in the additive model. Thus  additive effects are relatively well predicted  whether the dominance effect is modeled or not. The accuracy of predictions of total genetic values in cross-validation was not higher with the dominance than with the additive model because the proportion of full-sibs and dominance effect relationship coefficients between the training and validation datasets were small. Thus  little information was transferred from the reference to the validation group in cross-validation for prediction of dominance effects. Su et al. []  who analyzed non-additive effects for average daily gain with a dataset of 1911 purebred pigs  observed that the estimates of the additive variance with the additive and dominance models remained fairly constant and that gains in accuracies of predicted breeding values and predicted total genetic values reached only 0.004 and 0.011 with the dominance model. The proportion of full-sibs in the pig dataset was not reported in Su et al. [] but is expected to be substantially larger than in our cow dataset  which might be the reason for the gain in accuracy of predicted total genetic values with inclusion of dominance in the model. Based on a simulation study  Varona et al. [] observed that relevant changes in breeding values when switching from an additive to a dominance model were obtained only for animals that had full-sibs or full-sib progeny and little other information. A cow dataset with a larger proportion of full-sibs would contain more information in order to accurately estimate dominance effects but in practice such data is not available. Analysis of full-sib progeny from elite animals  which generally are available  would not be representative for the whole population. The regression coefficient of YD on predicted breeding values was generally close to 1  with a few exceptions. With the dominance model  this regression coefficient was slightly closer to 1 for most traits but differences were small  which is similar to the data reported by Su et al. []  i.e. 0.927 and 0.983 with the additive and dominance models  respectively. In our study  the regression coefficient of YD on predicted total genetic values for model MGD was slightly smaller than the regression on predicted breeding values  which agrees with Su et al. []  but it remained close to the expectation  which means that predictions were unbiased. In general  bias can originate from preferential treatment  unrecognized pre-selection of validation animals  or inappropriate modeling of predictions (i.e. using incorrect variance components). The results show that selection of matings on  instead of  led to 14.8% (milk yield) and 27.8% (protein yield) greater expected total genetic superiorities and maximized expected productive performance of the offspring. Although the accuracy of estimates of total genetic values was not greater than that of estimates of breeding values  as indicated by the cross-validation results (Table )  expected total genetic superiority was not impaired by this result because predicted genetic values are best linear unbiased predictions and therefore unbiased expectations []. Toro and Varona [] reported that expected total genetic superiority with optimized mate allocation was 16% greater than with selection on the breeding value only  for a trait with additive and dominance variances amounting to 40 and 10% of the phenotypic variance. Expected additive genetic gain was reduced by only 4.5% for milk yield and by 2.6% for protein yield with selection of matings on  instead of . Thus  optimization of  of the offspring appears to be feasible without a great loss in . Our considerations of optimized matings are limited to the first generation offspring. Toro and Varona [] found that response from assortative mating was only realized in the first generation without any additional response in subsequent generations. Thus  optimization of matings with respect to total genetic value has to be applied in each generation  otherwise the dominance-specific advantage is lost. Toro and Varona [] pre-selected males and females on their estimated breeding values and then optimized the total genetic value of matings between these pre-selected animals. In our example  only bulls were pre-selected on their conventional breeding value and the optimal bull was determined for each cow based on the expected total genetic value of the offspring. However  the potential of assortative mating to exploit dominance variance optimally by combining mates that are expected to produce offspring with large total genetic values is limited even for these two traits with sizeable dominance variation. This can be caused either by cancellation effects across the genome (i.e.  it is extremely unlikely to combine all positive dominance effects) or by a reduced accuracy of the dominance deviation of a mating because of uncertainty about the resulting marker genotypes. Estimates of genomic variance due to dominance in Fleckvieh cattle ranged from 3 to 50% of the genetic variance and were within the range of published pedigree-based estimates for dairy cattle. The computational complexity and modeling were straightforward. Predictive ability of breeding and total genetic values by cross-validation was not improved when dominance effects were included in the prediction model  probably because of the limited size of the dataset and the small proportion of full-sibs. There is potential to exploit dominance variance in planned matings in order to increase total genetic value of the offspring (i.e. future performance) without compromising additive genetic gain. Use of planned matings could also be a way to motivate farmers that are otherwise not interested in using genomic breeding values for breeding schemes.

To maintain inbreeding at an acceptable rate  a selection algorithm that restricts the increase in mean kinship  such as optimum contribution selection  is required. Aquaculture produces fish at an affordable price that are a valuable source of animal proteins  especially in developing countries []. Selective breeding plays an important role in aquaculture and provides high quality seed with better growth rate and survival []. Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) in tropical countries [  ]  and Atlantic salmon in temperate and cold countries [] are good examples that illustrate the benefits of selective breeding. However  there is evidence that fish with high growth rate may be more aggressive and competitive [  ]. Competition is a type of social interaction that is very common in aquaculture environments. It reduces productivity and represents a threat to animal welfare [  ]. Thus  fish breeders may need to improve productivity and welfare by taking social interactions into account in their breeding programs. In the absence of social interactions among individuals  the phenotypic value () of an individual  say   can be modeled as the sum of its additive genetic or breeding value ()  and a non-genetic component  usually referred to as environment () []  Using this model  breeders have achieved substantial genetic improvement. However  in some cases  especially for traits related to behavior  populations have not responded as expected  in spite of the presence of heritable variation. For example  selection for survival increased mortality in laying hens []. One of the reasons for these unexpected responses may be the presence of indirect genetic effects (IGE). An IGE is a heritable effect of an individual on the trait value of another individual [–]. For example  in fish  when an individual carries genes that cause it to monopolize the feeder  the growth rate of its group mates will be reduced. Another well-known example is mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens  where the survival of an individual depends on the genes for pecking behaviour in its cage mates []. For such traits  the model in Equation () needs to be expanded with IGE [    ]  where   is the phenotype of focal individual ;  and  are the direct breeding value and direct non-genetic effect of individual   respectively;  and  are the indirect breeding value and indirect non-genetic effect originating from its group mate   respectively; and  is the group size. The summations are taken over the -1 group mates of an individual  thus excluding . This model applies to all  group members. From the perspective of the recipient  each individual’s phenotype is the consequence of a direct effect of itself  and the sum of the indirect effects of its -1 social partners. From the perspective of the acting individual  each individual expresses its direct genetic effect once in its own phenotype  and its IGE -1 times  once in each of its -1 group mates. Thus  in addition to the classical (direct) breeding value (Equation 1)  each individual affects its -1 group mates  and is also affected by its -1 group mates. Several studies have shown the existence of IGE  in quail []  poultry [–]  pigs [  ]  cattle []  and fish []. Theoretical and empirical studies show that response to selection for socially affected traits can be increased by applying a selection strategy that accounts for both direct and indirect genetic effects  such as kin or group selection [          ]. Muir []  for example  conducted a selection experiment for egg production in cannibalistic laying hens using group selection  and managed to increase egg production from 91 to 237 eggs per hen  largely as result of improved survival. There have been several other selection experiments on socially affected traits  for example  in quail [] and flour beetles [  ]. To our knowledge  there have been no similar studies in aquaculture species. Theoretical and experimental work on socially affected traits shows that response to selection can be increased by using structured populations with groups composed of related individuals. In such populations  response to selection is maximized by selecting on the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) of breeding values []. However  such selection schemes may lead to high rates of inbreeding  because they increase the probability of co-selection of relatives [  ]. High rates of inbreeding cause a reduction of genetic variance and threaten the long-term sustainability of breeding programs [–]. In this study  we examined the effect of BLUP selection for a socially affected trait on the rate of inbreeding for a fish breeding program using stochastic simulation. However  the methods and results are also applicable to other species with similar breeding designs. Data were simulated using the R-language []. The simulated population was a closed nucleus with discrete generations in which base population animals were assumed unrelated. Bivariate normal distributions were used to simulate both the genetic and the non-genetic direct and indirect effects of base animals. Subsequently  in each generation  25 sires and 50 dams were selected and randomly mated. Each male was mated to two females in a nested design  which is a common mating structure in aquaculture breeding programs. Each dam produced eight progeny and the sex of the progeny was randomly assigned with equal probability. Direct and indirect breeding values of an offspring were simulated as the average breeding value of its parents plus a Mendelian sampling deviation  sampled from a bivariate normal distribution. Individuals in each generation were assigned to groups of eight members  with a group consisting of two full-sib families and each family contributing four progeny. Subsequently  phenotypes of individuals were constructed according to Equation  and breeding values were estimated (see below). We chose a design with two families per group because this scheme is optimal to estimate the indirect genetic variance [] and yields greater response to selection than schemes with groups composed at random with respect to family [  ]. Schemes with a single family per group would yield an even greater response  but would not allow the estimation of the direct and indirect genetic variances [    ]. Hence  having two families per group appears to be an attractive compromise for response to selection and variance component estimation. The top 25 male candidates and top 50 female candidates were selected as parents of the next generation based on the BLUP estimate of their total breeding value ()  where  and  are the estimated direct and indirect breeding values  respectively  and  is group size []. For each scenario  20 generations of selection were simulated. The BLUP estimated breeding values (EBV) were obtained from the following model [  ]  using the R-version of ASReml []: where  is the vector of phenotypic observations;  is the overall mean  which was the only fixed effect included;  and  are the vectors of direct and indirect random genetic effects  respectively;  is the vector of random group effects  and  is the vector of random residuals. The random group effects in  occur as a result of the non-genetic indirect effects ( in Equation )  which create a covariance among group members that can be fitted as a group effect. The magnitude of this covariance equals   where  is the direct–indirect non-genetic covariance and  is the non-genetic indirect variance []. Thus   is determined by the phenotypic variances  heritabilities and non-genetic correlations that were used as input values for the simulations (see Table  below). The     and  are the known design matrices that assign observations to the levels of the direct genetic effects of the animals themselves  to the IGE of their group mates  and to the random group effects  respectively. The -matrix has a “1” in the column for each group mate of the individual producing the record. Hence  since the group size was equal to 8 in our data  each row of  contains seven 1 s  each linking the IGE of one group mate to the record of the individual. The covariance structure of the random effects was: In the estimation of breeding values  the true (  simulated) values of the genetic parameters were used. Genetic parameters were not estimated from the simulated data. The inbreeding coefficients of individuals were calculated from the pedigree by using the R-package “pedigree” []. For each replicate  the rate of inbreeding () was then calculated using the mean inbreeding coefficients of generations 10 and 20: Rates of inbreeding were averaged over 100 replicates and the standard error was calculated. The first 10 generations were not used in the calculation of the rate of inbreeding  to allow the population to reach equilibrium with respect to the Bulmer effect and the buildup of pedigree information [–]. The Bulmer effect reduces the between-family variance  which reduces the correlation between EBV of relatives. This  in turn  reduces the probability of co-selection of relatives  which reduces the rate of inbreeding. Thus  the Bulmer-effect affects the rate of inbreeding []. A base scenario and three alternatives were simulated (Table ). In all schemes  the direct phenotypic variance was set to 1  . The base scenario was a reference scenario without indirect effects (genetic and non-genetic)  where trait values were generated according to Equation . The alternative scenarios considered different magnitudes of indirect effects: mild (scenario 1)  intermediate (scenario 2) or strong (scenario 3). The magnitude of indirect effects was measured by their contribution to phenotypic variance in a population in which interacting individuals are unrelated  which is given by  and was equal to 0.25  1  or 4 (). Thus  compared to direct effects  the contribution of indirect effects was equal to one quarter to four-fold the direct phenotypic variance () to phenotypic variance. For all scenarios  “heritabilities” of direct and indirect genetic effects were equal to 0.1  0.3 or 0.5 ( and ). Genetic and non-genetic correlations between direct and indirect effects were varied as follows:  =  = -0.8  -0.4  0  0.4 or 0.8. Across the four scenarios  rates of inbreeding ranged from 2.21 to 5.76%. The standard errors of the rates of inbreeding (average over 100 replicates) were small and ranged from 0.0004 to 0.0014  which indicates that the results were accurate. For presentation purposes  the results were grouped according to the correlation between direct and indirect effects: Neutral  the direct–indirect correlations were equal to zero ( = 0); Competition  the correlations were negative ( = -0.4 and -0.8); Cooperation  the correlations were positive ( = 0.4 and 0.8). Under the neutral situation  the direct effect of an individual on its own trait value is independent of its indirect effect on the trait values of its group mates. Figure  shows the results for this situation. Rates of inbreeding were always greater for scenarios with IGE than with the base scenario. The range for rates of inbreeding obtained from scenarios 1  2 and 3 was 3.17 to 5.54%  and from 1.95 to 4.09% for the base scenario. The rates of inbreeding within each scenario were greatest with a low “heritability” (  lower values of  and ). In a competitive situation  an individual with positive effects on its own trait value will on average have negative effects on the trait values of its group mates (Figure a and b). In this situation  the rate of inbreeding was lowest with the base scenario and highest with scenario 1. Rates of inbreeding were almost identical for both direct–indirect correlations with scenario 1. The rates of inbreeding for scenario 2 were between those for scenarios 1 and 3. However  note that in scenario 2  a change in the direct–indirect correlation had a greater effect on rates of inbreeding than in the other scenarios. The lowest rates of inbreeding were obtained from scenario 3 and rates of inbreeding decreased when the correlation changed from -0.4 to -0.8. In the cooperative situation  an individual with positive effects on its own trait value also has positive effects on the trait values of its group mates (Figure a and b). Apart from the base scenario  which again produced the lowest inbreeding rate  ranking of scenarios with respect to rate of inbreeding was precisely opposite for this situation to that obtained from the competitive situation. The highest rate of inbreeding was obtained from scenario 3 and the lowest from scenario 1. Scenario 3 also showed the most stable rates of inbreeding across different direct–indirect correlations. As was the case in the competitive situation  scenario 2 was the most sensitive to a change in the value of the direct–indirect correlation.  Heritabilities are the ratio of additive genetic variance to the corresponding “phenotypic” variance; for direct effects   and for indirect effects ; the SE of rate of inbreeding ranged between 0.00039 and 0.00125.  Heritabilities are the ratio of additive genetic variance to the corresponding “phenotypic” variance; for direct effects   and for indirect effects ; the SE of rate of inbreeding ranged between 0.00046 and 0.00139.  Heritabilities are the ratio of additive genetic variance to the corresponding “phenotypic” variance; for direct effects   and for indirect effects ; the SE of rate of inbreeding ranged between 0.00038 and 0.00129. Our results indicate that BLUP selection on socially affected traits results in greater rates of inbreeding than BLUP selection solely for direct genetic effect  regardless of the genetic correlations between direct and indirect genetic effects. Furthermore  the pattern of the rates of inbreeding for different “heritabilities” was in agreement with BLUP selection theory  with lower heritability yielding higher rates of inbreeding [  ]. For decades  inbreeding has been identified as an important issue in animal breeding [    ]. Artificial selection is known to increase the rate of inbreeding because individuals from the best performing families are selected and contribute more to the gene pool compared to those from lower performing families [  –]  which is confirmed by our results. Without selection  the expected rate of inbreeding for the simulated population is about 0.75% per generation (using   with <U+2009>=<U+2009>25 and <U+2009>=<U+2009>50). In our study  the rates of inbreeding (2.21 to 5.76% with IGE  and 1.95 to 4.09% without IGE) were considerably higher. Furthermore  the highest rates of inbreeding were obtained with low heritabilities. This is as expected with BLUP selection  since information from relatives receives higher weight with low heritabilities  which increases the probability of co-selection of relatives  thus increasing the rate of inbreeding [  ]. To investigate whether lower heritabilities can explain the higher rates of inbreeding observed in scenarios with IGE  we calculated the classical ( direct) heritability    for the four scenarios under the neutral situation  for values of  =  = 0.3. Phenotypic variance for groups composed of two families was calculated as   where <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 is the relationship between members of the same family. The three scenarios with IGE had lower classical heritabilities than the base scenario (classical heritability of 0.3). For example  with scenario 2  classical heritability was 0.3/2.39<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13 (see Table  for the parameters used) and with scenarios 1 and 3  it was equal to 0.22 and 0.05  respectively. When comparing these classical heritabilities to the observed rates of inbreeding  the pattern was different from that observed with classical BLUP selection for direct effects only. The heritability for scenario 2 was in between those with scenarios 1 and 3  yet scenario 2 had the highest rate of inbreeding. Thus  apart from a potential effect working via classical heritability  IGE also affects the rate of inbreeding in other ways. However  based on these results  we cannot determine whether the increase in rate of inbreeding in scenarios 1 to 3 compared to the base scenario was caused by IGE or by a reduction in classical heritability due to extra variance. Therefore  we simulated an additional scheme with classical heritability fixed at 0.3 by increasing the direct genetic variance () for scenarios 1 and 2  while the genetic and non-genetic indirect effects remained unchanged. A comparison of the rate of inbreeding of this scheme to that of the base scenario (also for ) reveals the impact of IGE on the rate of inbreeding at a fixed classical heritability. For this additional scheme  the rates of inbreeding for scenarios 1 and 2 were equal to 3.62 and 3.86%  respectively  which was about 1% higher than in the base scenario (2.80%). Based on this result  we can confidently conclude that the indirect effect was a causal factor that contributed to the increase of the rate of inbreeding. Scenario 3 was not included as an additional scheme  because  would have to be greater than 1 to achieve a classical heritability of 0.3 for that scenario. Comparing the competitive (Figure ) and cooperative (Figure ) situations  we observed a re-ranking of scenarios 1 and 3. To understand the mechanisms behind these results  we calculated the correlations between the estimated total breeding values (ETBV) for full-sibs and half-sibs  for direct–indirect correlations of -0.8 (Figure a) and +0.8 (Figure b). The results show that the re-ranking of scenarios observed for the rate of inbreeding was mirrored in the correlation between ETBV of sibs. The highest correlation between ETBV of sibs was obtained from scenario 1 for a direct–indirect correlation of -0.8 and from scenario 3 for a direct–indirect correlation of +0.8. These results suggest that the correlation between ETBV of sibs is the main cause for the differences in rates of inbreeding. A higher correlation between ETBV of sibs increases the probability of co-selection of sibs  which  in turn  increases the rate of inbreeding because it increases the variance in long-term contributions of ancestors []. Nevertheless  the correlation between ETBV of sibs did not fully explain the observed pattern of rates of inbreeding. In Figure a  for example  the correlation between ETVB of sibs was nearly independent of “heritability” for scenario 1  but this trend was not reflected in the rate of inbreeding (Figure ). The observed pattern for the correlation between ETBV of sibs for the base scenario was similar to its pattern for rate of inbreeding.  Heritabilities are the ratio of additive genetic variance to the corresponding “phenotypic” variance; for direct effects   and for indirect effects . In traditional selection on BLUP EBV  rates of inbreeding and correlations between EBV of sibs are higher at lower heritability. Thus  it was interesting to investigate whether the same mechanism explains the re-ranking of scenarios 1 and 3 observed here. Therefore  we analyzed the relationship of the ratio of total heritable variance over phenotypic variance    with the rate of inbreeding. For the competitive situation  a lower  indeed corresponded to a higher rate of inbreeding. For example  with   values obtained from scenarios 1 and 3 were  = 0.05 and  = 0.39  and scenario 1 yielded a greater rate of inbreeding than scenario 3 (Figure b). However  for the cooperative situation  the rate of inbreeding increased when  increased. For example  with  = 0.8 ()  values obtained from scenarios 1 and 3 were  = 0.37 and  = 0.66  and the rates of inbreeding for scenario 3 were greater than for scenario 1 (Figure b). The above results on the relationship between inbreeding with classical heritability and  show that patterns observed with selection on classical BLUP-EBV cannot simply be extended to schemes that aim at improving socially affected traits. One reason is that the correlation between EBV of sibs is no longer a simple function of heritability  but depends also on the direct–indirect genetic correlation and on relatedness between group mates. In principle  the theory of long-term genetic contributions [  ] can be used to predict the rate of inbreeding for socially affected traits using a deterministic approach  similar to its application to selection on traditional animal model BLUP EBV []. However  this requires a pseudo-BLUP selection index [] for socially affected traits. Although this is relatively straight-forward in principle  the full single-trait pseudo-BLUP selection index for a socially affected trait with sib information has 24 distinct information sources (results not shown). Hence  deterministic prediction of the rate of inbreeding with social effects is feasible but cumbersome  and one may prefer to use stochastic simulations instead. This study focused on breeding schemes in aquaculture. However  the results are also relevant for other species in which selection is based on sib information. In our simulations  we covered a wide-range of values with respect to the magnitude of indirect effects  heritabilities and direct–indirect genetic correlations. For all scenarios  presence of IGE increased the rate of inbreeding. Moreover  our group size of eight individuals is similar to group sizes in pigs and laying hens bred in cage systems. Furthermore  the design with two families per group is optimal for maximizing response to selection while maintaining the opportunity to estimate genetic parameters []  and is thus relevant for any breeding scheme for traits affected by IGE. However  the strategy of mating one male to two females is typical for breeding programs applied on some aquaculture species but it is uncommon in livestock. We do not expect that the mating ratio will substantially change the impact of IGE on the rate of inbreeding in sib selection schemes. Hence  we postulate that the main result of this study  which is the presence of IGE increases rates of inbreeding  can be extended to sib selection schemes in other species. Because rates of inbreeding are greater with IGE  breeding programs that aim at improving socially affected traits require greater effort to contain inbreeding  which means that more genetic gain has to be sacrificed. Optimum contribution selection [] is the best method to restrict the rate of inbreeding while maximizing genetic gain  and implementation to traits affected by IGE is straightforward. Compared to current breeding schemes in aquaculture  which often rely on sib information  the use of genomic selection will decrease the correlation between EBV of sibs. Hence  we anticipate that the cost of restricting inbreeding will be reduced with genomic selection  and  for that reason  aquaculture breeding programs for socially affected traits would also benefit from genomic selection. The feasibility of BLUP and optimum contribution selection  however  depends on the availability of pedigree or genomic information []. Aquaculture breeding programs in developing countries are generally faced with difficulties to maintain a fully pedigreed structure because it is too costly to individually identify the fish. When pedigree or genomic information is not available  breeders have to rely on mass selection. IGE will not affect the rate of inbreeding with mass selection when groups are composed at random with respect to relatedness because IGE do not affect the ranking of individuals in this case []. However  genetic improvement of traits affected by IGE using mass selection is efficient only when the population is structured into groups consisting of families [  ]. Such schemes will also increase the resemblance between phenotypes of relatives and thus lead to increased rates of inbreeding when mass selection is simply by truncation based on the observed phenotype. Hence  in those cases  breeders will have to restrict the contribution of individual families to the next generation  which is less efficient and will yield further reduction in genetic gain compared to full optimal contribution selection. Our study shows that BLUP selection for socially affected traits increases the rate of inbreeding compared to traditional BLUP selection. This is at least partly due to the greater resemblance between EBV of relatives when animals are kept in groups consisting of two families. When accounting for IGE in a selection program  measures have to be taken to limit the rate of increase in mean kinship. Such measures may include optimum contribution selection  or limiting the number of candidates selected from each family.

Near-infrared spectrometry is an efficient tool to select liver quality in breeding programs because animals can be ranked according to their liver melting rate without damaging their livers. Thus  these original results will help breeders to select ducks based on the liver melting rate  a crucial criterion that defines the quality of the liver and for which there was previously no accurate predictor. France is the main producer of ‘Foie Gras’ and commercializes about 73% of all fatty liver sold in the world. The most valuable product in these production systems is the fatty liver of male mule ducks  which represents 92% of the French fatty liver production. The mule duck is an intergeneric hybrid between a male Muscovy duck () and a female common duck (). Technically  the quality of fatty liver is measured by the percentage of fat loss during cooking  which is called “melting rate” and is expected to be as low as possible. The processing yield represents the amount of product remaining after cooking  i.e. 100% minus the melting rate. There is a strong variability in the processing yield of fatty liver from mule ducks even when overfeeding and processing conditions are controlled. This variability is a problem for the industry  mainly because a maximum fat loss during cooking of 30% of the raw liver weight is laid down by French law (Journal Officiel de la République Française  1993). The melting rate (MR) and biochemical composition of fatty liver are not easily measured in commercial conditions. Both require either the partial or total destruction of the liver. Traditionally  fatty liver weight has been used as a predictor of MR for the industrial sorting of fatty livers due to its negative relationship with MR. However selection programs cannot be based on this parameter because it would lead to reduced liver weights. In addition  liver weight explains only 14% of the phenotypic variation of MR so its use for selection would be quite inefficient []. Recently  in addition to the use of the weight of fatty livers  biochemical traits  such as dry matter and protein content  were measured and used to predict the processing yield []. Such biochemical measures were found to be more accurate predictors of the processing yield than the liver weight alone. However  the predictive ability of the model remained low (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.43) even when both the biochemical composition and the weight of fatty liver were taken into account  and the biochemical measures required partial destruction of the liver. To date  selection on the melting rate has never been implemented  although 90% of the price of fatty liver is based on this trait. Neither fatty liver weight nor biochemical composition is an adequate phenotype to rank selection candidates. Under experimental conditions  the heritability estimates obtained for MR (measured in mule ducks) had intermediate values (0.19<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.04) on the maternal common line and low values (0.09<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03) on the paternal Muscovy line []. Thus  selection for MR would be interesting for both parental mule duck lines. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an analytical technique based on the absorption of infrared light by organic matter. Since absorption is linked to the chemical composition of samples  it can be predicted after a calibration phase. NIRS is widely used to predict the composition of animal products [] and for phenotypic prediction [–] in pigs  cows  chicken and waterfowl. Researchers have investigated dynamic (at-line or on-line) NIRS applications to qualify a sample  during technological processing (either for meat quality for pork []  beef [] or milk coagulation ability []) or offline NIRS applications for genetic variability estimates (either for meat composition or quality in pigs [  ]  rabbits [] and cows [  ] or for milk coagulation properties [–]). For all these experiments  NIRS appeared as a suitable alternative to classical analytical procedures. Generally  the NIRS equipment used in these studies were laboratory spectrometers measuring ground samples. Portable spectrometers with a separate probe for spectrum acquisition directly on the product surface are an alternative but their use is still limited []. The aim of this study was to compare genetic parameter estimates (in both parental lines) for the melting rate of duck fatty liver as measured by either the reference method or predicted using various NIRS technologies (offline on ground samples in the laboratory or at-line on intact livers) in order to select parental lines. The present study was carried out in agreement with the French National Guidelines for the care and use of animals for research purposes (Certificate no. 7740  Ministry of Agriculture and Fish Products  Paris  France). A total of 1552 male mule ducks were hatched over a two-year period. For both years  about 800 mule ducks were produced in two pedigree batches of 400 ducklings at the INRA Experimental Farm for Waterfowl Breeding (INRA-UEPFG  France). The mule ducks were hybrids between two experimental populations: 382 female back-cross (BC) common ducks () and 56 Muscovy drakes (). For each year and hatch  mule ducklings were bred in eight batches of about 50 animals. From hatching to 10 weeks of age  mule ducks were fed  with a commercial diet. From 10 to 12 weeks of age  duck were feed-restricted by 30 g/d per duck and then put back on a  diet at the beginning of the 12 week. At 12 weeks of age  ducks were bred for 12 days in collective cages of four or five individuals and were overfed twice a day with a mix (35% corn-flour  25% corn-grain and 40% water)  in two successive series of 200 animals with two different force-feeders. At the end of the overfeeding period (92 or 94 days of age according to series)  animals were slaughtered by severing the neck blood vessels after electrical stunning. Mule ducks were bled  plucked  and cooled to 4°C. Twenty four hours after slaughter  the fatty livers were extracted from the carcasses. Due to mortality (3.5%) and bleeding liver problems (0.4%)  fatty livers were collected for 1492 mule ducks. Subsequent analysis was performed on livers weighing between 300 g and 830 g (1422 fatty livers) in order to be consistent with the range of weights of commercialized livers. On the day of liver extraction  the fatty liver melting rate was measured on all livers by a cooking test as the percentage of fat released after sterilization (65 min at 105°C) of 60 g of liver. A round slice (40 mm diameter) was removed from each raw liver and two other samples (about 20 g per sample) were ground. All samples were stored at -20°C prior to spectrometric and biochemical analyses. In addition  a subset of 198 liver samples  selected for the development of NIRS calibration equations  were analyzed using the reference biochemical laboratory methods: lipid content using cold chloroform/methanol extraction []  dry matter after desiccation of the liver for 24 h in a drying oven at 103°C []  ash content in a muffle furnace at 550°C [] and protein content by wet mineralization (Kjeldhal method) []. Two types of reflectance spectrometry measurements were performed. A first measurement was performed directly on the fatty liver surface immediately after liver extraction (at 24 h ) using a portable ASD Labspec Pro spectrometer (wavelength range: 350–2500 nm) with a “contact probe” module. Six spectra were collected for each fatty liver and the average value was used for the calibration. A second set of measurements was performed in the laboratory on ground liver samples presented in quartz cells using a FOSS NIRSystems 6500 (wavelength range: 400–2500 nm). Each sample was measured three times (three different aliquots of the same sample) and the average spectrum was used for the subsequent calibration. Spectral data were processed using WINISI software (Infrasoft Int.  Port Matilda  Pennsylvania  USA). The visible wavelengths of the spectrum were discarded to avoid hypersensitive models in which differences in color unrelated to liver composition and melting rate were taken into account. The wavelengths used were 800 to 2500 nm. Several statistical pre-processing steps [] were tested such as combining the order of derivation (0  1 or 2)  varying the number of data points for smoothing and derivation (0  5  10  15 or 20 data points) and mathematical treatment (normalization  detrending and multiplicative scatter correction). The best results (lowest cross-validation errors during calibration) were obtained with the first derivative (calculated on 10 data points) combined with smoothing (5 data points) on normalized spectra (SNV<U+2009>=<U+2009>standard normal variate). The NIRS calibration database consisted of 198 liver samples that were selected in order to represent the spectral variability of the total set of ground samples measured using the FOSS spectrometer and characterized by analytical measurements previously described. For each spectrometer  the calibration equations were developed for melting rate (MR) and for dry matter (DM)  ash content (AC)  lipid content (Lip) and protein content (Prot) as reported by Bastianelli et al[]. In the WINISI software  the procedure of representative sample selection is based on PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The calibration equations were obtained by Partial Least Square (PLS) regression. A cross-validation was performed on five groups during the calibration process: calibration was performed on four groups and then applied to the remaining group; this process was repeated five times and the average error was calculated (SECV  Standard Error of Cross-Validation). Then the calibration equations were validated against the 1224 samples (i.e. 1422 minus 198) that were not used for calibration and formed an external dataset. Hence the predictive ability of the equation can be estimated on new samples. The resulting prediction error (SEP  Standard Error of Prediction) was calculated. The traits analyzed were the measured melting rate (mMR) of the liver  and liver attributes  respectively  predicted using FOSS and ASD spectrometers  such as the melting rate (pMR-FOSS and pMR-ASD  respectively)  dry matter (pDM-FOSS and pDM-ASD  respectively)  the ash content (pAC-FOSS and pAC-ASD  respectively)  lipid content (pLip-FOSS and pLip-ASD  respectively) and protein content (pProt-FOSS and pProt-ASD  respectively). According to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at 5%  these 11 traits were normally distributed. Genetic parameters were estimated by combining pedigree information from both parental populations (common and Muscovy) and from mule duck performances  using the model of Lo et al[]: where  is the vector of observations for crossbreds (1422 mule ducks);  the vector of systematic effects for the combination of year  batch and force-feeder effects (12 levels);  () the additive genetic effects of the common dams (Muscovy sires) of mule ducks  as expressed in the phenotypes of the mule ducks (population C);  the vector of residual effects; and  and  the incidence matrices relating the observations to the corresponding effects. We stress that  contains the Mendelian sampling of crossbred animals  as well as the “true” residual environmental effects. In short  the model substitutes the genetic effect of the crossbred with half the breeding value of their parents  plus a Mendelian sampling. Pedigrees were traced back up to five generations of ancestors for both parental lines and consisted of 596 animals in the common line and 201 animals in the Muscovy line. Multiple trait genetic parameters were estimated by Gibbs sampling using the program “gibbs1f90” []. Flat priors were used for variances and covariance. The variance and covariance components of given averages were respectively equal to 1 and 0.01. A total chain length of 100 000 iterations was run and 20 000 samples were discarded as burn-in. The heritability estimates are the ratio between the paternal variance (versus the maternal variance) and the total variance for the Muscovy parental line (versus the common parental line). These estimates cannot be considered as “real” heritabilities of mule ducks but rather as “partial” heritabilities. The characteristics of calibration equations for the melting rate are reported in Table . For the FOSS spectrometer  the coefficient of determination (R) of the calibration equation was high for the melting rate (0.87). The prediction error  estimated by SECV  was also quite high (6.07%) but sufficient to rank samples given the high variability of the melting rate in the population (SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>14.7%). With the ASD spectrometer  the R value was only 0.02 points lower than with the FOSS spectrometer; the SECV value was therefore slightly higher (7%). The external validation process on 1224 samples confirmed the predictive ability of NIRS with SEP values that were close to SECV values for both spectrometers. An interesting point is that the measurements performed with the ASD spectrometer on intact livers taken immediately after liver extraction resulted in a good prediction of the melting rate. This result is consistent with the results obtained for the biochemical composition of livers in the same conditions []. The FOSS and ASD spectrometers provided similar estimated heritabilities within the parental lines (Table ) since the differences between spectrometers (from 0.01 to 0.02) were lower than credibility intervals (from 0.03 to 0.04). The melting rate heritabilities estimated using NIRS ranged from 0.18 to 0.20 in the common line and from 0.11 to 0.12 in the Muscovy line. These results are fully comparable with the heritability estimates based on measured melting rates which were equal to 0.20<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 in the common line and 0.10<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.03 in the Muscovy line. It is worth noting that heritability values tended to be lower in the Muscovy line than in the common line. The genetic correlations between the different melting rates (measured and predicted with FOSS and ASD spectrometers) are in Table . For the common line  correlations ranged from +0.89 to +0.95 and for the Muscovy line  all estimates were equal to +0.97. Therefore  it is reasonable to assume that the melting rate traits measured or predicted (either with ground samples and a FOSS spectrometer or on intact samples at slaughter with the ASD spectrometer) are genetically the same trait. In addition  the ranking of the selection candidates was the same (Spearsman’s rank correlations greater than 0.90)  regardless of the melting rate trait used to estimate breeding values. The heritabilities estimated for biochemical parameters (Table ) using FOSS and ASD spectrometers were lower than those for the melting rate in both parental lines  but differences were particularly pronounced in the common line. The heritability estimates for the liver ash content were null (values of 0.01<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.01 regardless of the line and spectrometer). As observed for the melting rate  heritability values tended to be lower in the Muscovy line than in the common line  whatever the trait. The genetic correlations between a biochemical trait predicted with the FOSS spectrometer and the same trait predicted with the ASD spectrometer are in Table . For the common line  correlations ranged from +0.87 to +0.95 and for the Muscovy line estimates were a little smaller (from +0.81 to +0.96). Except for dry matter  the correlations between both predictions for biochemical traits were lower than correlations for liver melting rate (0.95 and 0.97 for the common and Muscovy lines  respectively). The genetic correlations between the measured melting rate and the biochemical traits predicted using either the FOSS or the ASD spectrometer (Table ) were high and similar for both parental lines  ranging in absolute value from 0.81 to 0.95 for the common line and from 0.82 to 0.96 for the Muscovy line. The R value obtained here for the melting rate predicted with the FOSS spectrometer is high (0.87)  ranging between the R value for lipid (0.93) and protein contents (0.78) []. It is higher than the R value for milk processing traits predicted using Mid-InfraRed (MIR) spectroscopy []  which range from 0.61 to 0.69 for the rennet coagulation time and from 0.46 to 0.52 for curd firmness. Different factors contribute to the lower performance of the ASD spectrometer for fatty liver predictions (R<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85) compared to the FOSS spectrometer: the conditions of spectrum collection (in particular a more constant ambient temperature in the laboratory than in the slaughterhouse)  artefacts due to the presence of condensed water on the liver surface  and finally the optic fiber probe used with the ASD spectrometer that might decrease its accuracy []. Nevertheless  the differences in the accuracy of the two spectrometer techniques is lower than that reported by Marie-Etancelin et al[] for the composition of duck breast meat. Some experiments conducted on the use of NIRS on the surface of beef meat to predict quality traits [] led to the conclusion that it was possible to predict meat color but that NIRS correlations for physical or sensory traits were too low and resulted in irrelevant predictions. In our study  and in contrast with Prieto et al. [] or to a lesser extent with Cecchinato et al[]  the processing yield obtained with the ASD spectrometer on the surface of fatty liver is sufficient to predict phenotypic values for the melting rate. The melting rate seems to be an exception among processing traits because it is predicted correctly using a NIRS surface measurement. This could be due to the correlation of MR with the biochemical composition of fatty liver (R of 0.58 between MR and fat content). Genetic parameters of mule fatty liver traits were estimated for each parental population and we observed that  whatever the trait  the standard deviations of genetic correlations were higher in the Muscovy line than in the common line. A similar trend was observed for all traits studied in the same dataset []. The smaller number of animals in the Muscovy pedigree (compared to the common line) could explain the lower accuracy of the correlations. In addition  heritability values were clearly higher in the common population compared to the Muscovy line (with differences ranging from 0.02 to 0.10 points depending on the trait) but the genetic correlations were similar. These differences in heritability of traits depending on the parental line have already been reported by [] for carcass and muscle weight and by [] for the vast majority (but not all) of the 37 mule ducks traits studied. Considering that the mule ducks were full-sibs on the dam’s side and a mix between full- and half-sibs on the sire’s side  the partial heritability estimates should be multiplied by 2 in the common population and by a value between 2 and 4 in the Muscovy population. Thus  the differences in heritability between the parental populations were greatly reduced. Nevertheless  as discussed in []  two hypotheses can be proposed: either there is a real difference between the genetic determinism of the two parental lines  or the maternal or family effect is absorbed in the additive genetic effect of the female duck resulting in artificially overestimated heritabilities in the maternal common line. To compare our heritability estimates with previously published values  we must consider that  due to the “sire-dam” model used  the total genetic variability of mule traits was divided into the paternal and the maternal lines  the sire and the dam accounting for a ratio between a quarter to a half of the additive variance of the trait. Since additive genetic correlations between predicted and measured melting rates were higher than 0.89  we concluded that NIRS is a useful criteria to select MR in breeding programs. Studies on the genetic determinism of quality traits predicted by NIRS are scarce  and are mostly related to the composition of meat and very rarely to the processing capacity of products. Only Cecchinato et al[] published results for predicting cooking losses of beef meat with NIRS  and concluded that NIRS could not be used to predict traits because R was low and the heritability and genetic correlations with physical analysis were close to zero. However  Cecchinato et al[] demonstrated that the rennet coagulation time of cow milk could be selected using MIR spectra. Our genetic study on the melting rate of fatty liver - the main processing trait for the fatty liver industry - is therefore original and moreover leads to relevant results particularly for the selection of ducks. The genetic correlation between the predictions of the melting rate with the two spectrometers is very high (>0.95); the correlations with the measured melting rate are also very strong. Thus  we conclude that predictions using the ASD spectrometer  which preserve the fatty liver integrity and is the only operational spectrometry technique that can be used under industrial conditions  will enable effective selection based on the fatty liver melting rate. Moreover  the genetic correlations between the measured melting rate and each of the predicted biochemical parameters are equal or lower than the genetic correlations between the measured melting rate and its NIRS predictions. If all ‘biochemical’ phenotypes associated (correlated) with measured melting rate were combined in a single predictor of melting rate  the accuracy of this predictor could be obtained using the Selection Index theory []. This accuracy reached +0.92 for the common line and +0.91 for the Muscovy line using the biochemical measurements []. In the present study  accuracies using ASD spectrometer measures were a little higher: +0.93 for the common line and +0.97 for the Muscovy line. Moreover  developing NIRS prediction equations to predict the biochemical analyses and estimating the accuracy of MR prediction are more complex and expensive than developing NIRS prediction equations directly from melting rate measurements. This study shows that the melting rate predicted on undamaged products using an at-line ASD spectrometer is similar to that obtained on ground samples using an offline FOSS spectrometer. The NIRS predictions and the measured melting rate are the same trait. From a genetic point of view  selection on the fatty liver melting rate is now possible using NIRS technology. In breeding programs  the ASD spectrometer seems to be a more appropriate support because spectra are collected directly in the slaughterhouse and the fatty liver  a valuable product  is not damaged. From a commercial point of view  NIRS-based predictions can be used to evaluate melting rates and adapt the process to the quality of fatty livers while maintaining liver integrity.

Recent innovation in high-throughput Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology has made SNP chips commercially available for most livestock species  including cattle  sheep  pigs  horses and chickens []. Bayesian linear regression models (Bayes A  B and C  Bayesian LASSO  machine learning methods) have made jointly fitting all SNP effects feasible for genomic prediction and genome-wide association analyses. Application of genome-wide Bayesian regression models  as described by Meuwissen et al. []  require simultaneous estimation of marker effects across the entire genome using genotypes and phenotypes of animals in a training population  before prediction of breeding values of selection candidates or animals in a validation population based on their marker genotypes and estimated marker effects from the training data analyses. Findings from recent genome-wide studies investigating the effects of marker density  heritability  number of observations and relationships among the individuals in training population using simulated or actual data have indicated that genomic prediction is often superior to pedigree-based BLUP prediction in terms of accuracy of prediction [–]. For continuous traits  the factors that affect the accuracy of genomic prediction by Bayesian linear regression models have been studied using simulated [–] and field [  ] data analyses in purebred (PB) and multibreed (MB) populations. Results from those studies have demonstrated that accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) depend on the number of records in the training population  the heritability of the trait  the effective population size  the size of the genome  the density of markers  the genetic architecture of the trait  and the extent of relatedness between training and validation populations [    ]. Calus et al. [] investigated the accuracy of GEBV produced by genomic selection in a simulation study using different map densities and haplotype structures in a 3 Morgan genome in an unselected outbred population  and found that the greatest benefit of genomic selection was for traits with a low heritability. Categorical scores are often recorded because they are easier to obtain than continuous observations on the same trait. Many traits of low heritability have ordered categorical scores  such as susceptibility or resistance to a disease and reproductive traits like calving difficulty. In theory  methods that are used to analyze continuously distributed traits are not optimal for the analysis of ordinal categorical traits []. Wright [] developed the threshold concept to map a normally distributed underlying variable to the observed ordered categorical phenotypes. In a threshold model  the phenotype is assumed to be the visible expression of an underlying continuous variable rendered discrete via a set of fixed thresholds []. Gianola and Foulley []  and Harville and Mee [] developed the threshold mixed effects model  which has become popular for pedigree-based genetic evaluation of ordinal categorical traits. Due to the importance of ordinal categorical scores in animal production systems and the benefits of genomic selection  Kizilkaya et al. [] used a BayesC threshold model to analyze the ordinal categorical trait of Infectious Bovine Keratoconjunctivitis in Angus beef cattle. The same model was used for the genome-wide association analysis of first service conception and pregnancy in Brangus heifers [] and for insect bite hypersensitivity []. Furthermore  BayesA  Bayesian LASSO and two machine learning methods []  as well as BayesB [] have been extended to the threshold model in order to obtain genomic predictions of breeding values for binary traits. It is expected that the realized accuracy for an ordinal categorical trait will be lower than that predicted from theory for a continuous trait in the same population with the same genetic architecture and heritability. The objective of this study was to use computer simulation to quantify that reduction in accuracy for an ordinal categorical trait relative to a continuous trait across the range of commonly encountered heritabilities in purebred and multibreed beef cattle populations. In order to quantify the reduction in accuracy of prediction of breeding values for an ordinal categorical trait relative to a continuous trait  underlying and ordinal categorical phenotypes for a training population  and true breeding values for training and validation populations were simulated using real SNP data from two beef cattle resource populations. The SNP genotypes were obtained using DNA samples extracted from semen or hair samples and did not require an approved animal use and care protocol. These simulations are described in greater detail below. High-density genotypes 53 367 (50k) were obtained from the two resource populations using the Bovine SNP50 Infinium II BeadChip (Illumina  Inc.  San Diego CA). The first resource population included 2250 purebred (PT) American Angus cattle [] and was used as the training population. The second population included a subsample of 924 animals from the multibreed Carcass Merit Project []  and was used as the validation population (MV). In that population  Angus  Brahman  Charolais  Hereford  Limousin  Maine-Anjou  Shorthorn  South Devon AI sires were mated to commercial cows  and DNA samples and phenotypes were collected from 239 Angus-  10 Brahman-  183 Charolais-  78 Hereford-  45 Limousin-  137 Maine-Anjou-  97 Shorthorn-  and 135 South Devon-sired steer offspring []. The 239 purebred Angus animals in the MV population were used as a purebred Angus validation (PV) population in the project. SNP covariate values of 0  1  or 2  representing the number of B alleles in the Illumina A/B allele calls  were available for each locus. Missing genotypes represented less than 0.2% of total observations and were replaced with average covariate values for that locus. All genotypes were retained for analysis  regardless of minor allele frequency in the genotype data set []. The observed 50k genotypes from the PT population were used to simulate  = 2250 underlying (latent) phenotypes with heritability of 10%  25% or 50%. Then   = 1000 samples were selected randomly from 2250 observations in order to create smaller training populations. The underlying phenotypic value of each animal was simulated using the model: where  is the underlying phenotypic value of animal    is a vector of fixed effects sampled from the standard normal distribution   ' is the incidence row vector of animal   relating its fixed effects to the underlying phenotypic value   is a Bernoulli random variable indicating the selection of locus  as a QTL from the observed SNP loci with fixed probability (1- ) where  = 0.999   is the random substitution effect for locus   sampled from a normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and variance    is the number of SNPs and  is the mean heterozygosity of the SNPs   is the covariate with 0  1 or 2 at locus  for animal   and  is the random residual effect  which has a standard normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and variance  = 1. The value of  was estimated from all SNP loci in the PT population  and values of 0.12  0.33 or 1 were assigned to  so that the expected heritabilities () of underlying variables were 0.10  0.25 or 0.50 []. Thirty-two replicates of the data were generated for each of three heritability scenarios. One fixed class effect with three levels was generated from the standard normal distribution in the simulation. Levels of fixed effects were randomly assigned to individuals in generating the underlying phenotypic values. The fixed effects ()  loci representing QTL (=1) and substitution effects () were sampled independently in each replicate. In order to generate ordinal categorical phenotypes with four () categories  the underlying phenotypic values were mapped to ordinal categorical phenotypes based on the following threshold () parameters: The threshold values were =0.61  =1.41  and =2.05  which correspond to calving categories of no assistance  minor assistance  major assistance and caesarian section with frequencies of 73  19  6  and 2%  as observed in a Gelbvieh population [] (Figure ).                                                      Two () and three ()-category ordinal data sets were created by combining categories in the four-category ordinal data sets as follows: The threshold model [] assumes that ordinal categorical data are determined by unobserved underlying continuous () variables and a set of unknown fixed thresholds  <<…<  where  is the number of mutually exclusive  ordered categories. More specifically  the ordinal categorical score () for animal  is assumed to be determined by the following: where  is the underlying variable of animal   and (.) is an indicator function taking the value 1 when expression (.) is true and 0 otherwise. Marker-based binomial or ordinal threshold models were developed by modifying the Bayes C model described by Kizilkaya et al. []  with the underlying variable for animal  modeled as follows: where  is a  x1 vector of fixed effects   ' is a known incidence row vector corresponding to fixed effects in    is the number of SNP loci in the genotype file   is the covariate (0  1 or 2) at locus  for animal   = [ …  ] is a  x1 vector of random substitution effects for  loci  and  is a random residual. It was assumed that  given the location parameters  and   the underlying variable  of animal  is conditionally independent and distributed as The joint posterior density of        and the underlying variable [] is given by: To ensure identifiability in the threshold model   and the first threshold () were set to 1 and 0  respectively. Flat prior distributions were assigned for the fixed effects . In Bayes C  threshold model  the prior for  follows a mixture distribution as: where  is the probability that a SNP has no effect on the trait. The parameter  was treated as unknown with uniform (0  1) prior. The variance  was a priori assumed to be a scaled inverse  with degrees of freedom  = 4 and scale parameter . A flat prior was assumed for the thresholds. The fixed effects  were sampled from where  and  is matrix  with the  th column deleted  and  is vector  with  th element deleted. The full conditional posterior distribution for  was where  and . The common effect variance  was sampled from a scaled inverse  with degrees of freedom  and scale   where  is the number of SNPs fitted in iteration . The full conditional posterior distribution of the underlying variable was This density is a truncated  distribution with mean  and variance = 1. A Metropolis-Hastings scheme with the proposal distribution of truncated   which was presented by Cowles []  was used to generate the samples for elements of  in the ordinal setting. The parameter of  was sampled from    (-+1  +1)  where  is the number of SNPs fitted in the model for iteration . The starting value of  was 0.5. Simulated liabilities  and binomial and ordinal categorical () data were modeled and analyzed as continuous traits using the linear model as follows  where  is  or  for animal    was normally distributed residuals with mean = 0 and unknown variance []. The 50k genotypes  excluding the 50 loci sampled as QTL (50k-QTL)  were used to analyze each replicate data set with simulated underlying variables () and ordinal categorical phenotypes (    and ). SNP effects were estimated within PT ( = 1000 and 2250) training populations and used to predict genetic merit in the PV and MV validation populations. These procedures were implemented by Gibbs sampling in the GenSel software [] applied to each replicated data set within each heritability scenario  by defining a burn-in period of 5000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) cycles before saving samples from each of an additional 40 000 MCMC cycles. In training and validation populations  the true () and estimated () genomic merits of animal  were calculated as where  is the PV or MV population   is the covariate (0  1 or 2) at QTL locus  for animal  in population    is the covariate (0  1 or 2) at locus  for animal  in population    is the true value of the substitution effect at QTL locus   and  is the posterior mean of the substitution effect at locus . In order to quantify the accuracy of prediction in validation populations  the sample covariance between the predicted () and true () additive genetic merits and their sample variances from breeds were pooled according to their respective degrees of freedom. In this study  the realistic marker panel  50k without QTL  was used for analyses of continuous and categorical phenotypes. The estimates of  varied depending on heritabilities  training population size  model of analysis and number of categories (Table ). These results indicated a significant decreasing trend in estimates of  with increasing heritability and training population size. Habier et al. [] investigated the estimation of  using a Bayes C  linear model in relation to number of training individuals  number of QTL and distribution of QTL effects. They observed decreasing trends for estimates of  with increasing training data size. Wolc et al. [] studied the evaluation of accuracy of GEBV for economically important traits measured at early or late ages in a closed population of layer chickens over five successive generations using a Bayes C  linear model  and found that accuracy of GEBV increased with the size of the training data  moreso for traits with low estimates of  and high heritability. Also  a higher accuracy of GEBV for traits with high estimates of  was observed. Table  shows the accuracies of GEBV for continuous and ordinal categorical phenotypes across training population size  heritability  model of analysis and number of categories. For continuous phenotypes  accuracies ranged from 0.12 to 0.66 for PV and from 0.04 to 0.53 for MV validation populations. For ordinal categorical scores  accuracies ranged from 0.04 to 0.55 for PV and from 0.01 to 0.44 for MV based on the analysis of threshold model  and from 0.04 to 0.50 for PV and from 0.01 to 0.39 for MV based on the analysis using the linear model on categorical scores. The results in Table  indicate that genome-wide analysis of an ordinal categorical phenotype resulted in a substantially lower accuracy of GEBV than the analysis of a continuous phenotype. To examine the effect of heritability  the relationship between training and validation populations  and the number of categories on the loss in accuracy due to categorizing a continuous trait  the accuracy of GEBV from the analysis of ordinal categorical scores from 1000 or 2250 training animals was expressed relative to the accuracy for the continuous phenotype in Figure . This relativity is important because a researcher with a fixed budget may have the choice of investing in either a difficult to measure expensive phenotype or of genotyping a larger training population that is characterized with a cheap and easily measured categorical score. For this reason  to further characterize the loss of information in terms of training population size  when going from a continuous to an ordinal categorical phenotype  the accuracy for the ordinal categorical phenotype from 2250 training animals was expressed relative to the accuracy for the continuous phenotype from 1000 training animals in Figure .  Accuracies are given by validation population  heritability  training population size  model of analysis and the number of categories.  The population size was 2250 for the categorical trait and was 1000 for the continuous trait. There was a substantial difference between actual accuracies of GEBV from PV and MV validation populations. PV validation populations resulted in about 30 to 40% higher accuracy than MV validation populations for ordinal categorical phenotypes (Table ). The relative accuracy of GEBV for categorical phenotypes in Figure  indicated that 5 to 80% of the accuracy from the continuous phenotype could be obtained in the analysis of the ordinal categorical phenotype within PV and MV validation populations. In addition  the relative accuracies of GEBV for categorical phenotypes within PV validation populations were about 1.5 fold higher than those within MV validation populations across heritabilities  training population size  analytical model and number of categories and a 2.25 fold increase in the training population size was not sufficient to provide similar relative accuracies within PV and MV validation populations (Figure ). Relative accuracies of GEBV for ordinal categorical phenotypes in Figure  were equal to or greater than 100% within PV and MV validation populations for heritabilities of 0.25 and 0.50. These findings indicate that a 2.25 fold increase in the size of the training population was sufficient to obtain a similar accuracy of GEBV for continuous and ordinal categorical phenotypes within PV and MV validation populations. However  this increase was not sufficient for a linear model analysis of ordinal categorical data with a heritability of 0.10 within PV and MV validation populations. These results demonstrate that validation of genomic prediction analyses of ordinal categorical phenotypes is sensitive to the choice of validation population and to pedigree relationships between the animals contributing to validation and training populations as has been shown for continuous traits []. Saatchi et al. [  ] applied genomic prediction to US Angus  Limousin and Simmental beef cattle to evaluate some routinely measured economically important traits. The accuracy of GEBV ranged from 0.22 to 0.69 in Angus  from 0.39 to 0.76 in Limousin and from 0.29 to 0.65 in Simmental cattle  using K-means clustering to minimize relationships between training and validation groups. The accuracy (0.38 to 0.85) of GEBV obtained by random clustering was higher for all traits than the corresponding accuracies obtained by K-means clustering. Villanueva et al. [] found higher accuracies than this study  equal to about 0.4 or 0.6  in the analysis of binomial phenotypes with a heritability of 0.1 or 0.3 but with higher genetic relationships between the training and validation populations. The difference between accuracies obtained in PV versus MV validation populations could result from the different extent and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) because there were significant differences in the extent of LD between PT  PV and MV populations (data not shown). Toosi et al. [] reported that using training and validation populations from the same breed resulted in the highest values of accuracy of GEBV in other cross or admixed populations and that compared to these values  when training and validation were done in different breeds  accuracy dropped by 46%. The importance of training population size and heritability on the accuracies of GEBV for continuous phenotypes [  ] and ordinal categorical phenotypes [] has been shown in simulation studies. The accuracy of GEBV depends on the genetic variation for the trait analyzed and the number of animals in the training population []. An increase in accuracy with training data size was confirmed in real continuous phenotypes. Habier et al. [] indicated that the accuracy of GEBV improved markedly with training data size for milk yield  fat yield and somatic cell scores from 1000 to 4000 North American Holstein bulls. In a study on the persistence of accuracy of GEBV over generations in layer chickens  Wolc et al. [] determined that accuracy tended to increase when the number of observations available for the training population increased about five folds from generation 1 to 5. Table  shows that when the training population size and heritability increased  accuracy of GEBV increased significantly for all models of analysis and for all number of categories in the ordinal categorical data. Increasing the size of training population resulted in increased accuracies of GEBV for heritabilities of 0.10 and 0.25 more than for heritabilities of 0.50 within the PV and MV validation populations. The gain in accuracy of GEBV was about 85 to 230% for heritabilities of 0.10  170 to 210% for heritabilities of 0.25 and 65 to 75% for a heritability of 0.50 across validation populations and analytical models (Table ). The effect of increasing training population size varied considerably depending on heritabilities  analytical models and the number of categories. The highest gain for a binomial phenotype was observed with heritabilities of 0.10 or 0.50  whereas the highest gain for four category ordinal phenotypes was found with a heritability of 0.25 across validation populations. The same pattern of relationships with training population size and heritability were observed for the accuracy of GEBV for the ordinal categorical phenotype relative to the continuous phenotype (Figure ). The largest increase in accuracy with training population size was observed for a heritability of 0.1 but the largest increase for relative accuracy was for heritabilities of 0.25 and 0.5 (Figure ). For heritabilities of 0.25 and 0.50  the accuracy obtained for the categorical trait relative to the continuous trait increased with the number of categories  but this trend was observed neither with a heritability of 0.1  nor for the linear model. With a threshold model  the accuracies of GEBV for ordinal categorical phenotypes given in Figure  indicate that a 2.25 fold increase in training population size was sufficient to achieve an accuracy equal to or greater than that obtained for the continuous phenotypes with a training population size of 1000 animals across heritabilities and numbers of categories. However  with a linear model  a greater than 2.25 fold increase in the size of training population would be required to achieve the same accuracy as a continuous trait with 1000 observations for the analysis of an ordinal categorical phenotype with a heritability of 0.10. Accuracies of GEBV in Table  and Figures  and  show that the threshold model had higher accuracies than linear model analyses when analyzing categorical data. Varona et al. [] compared linear and threshold models in conventional pedigree-based evaluations (EBV) by examining the correlation between predicted and true breeding values using simulated data sets for calving difficulty. The correlations with the threshold model were better than with the linear model for both direct and maternal effects. Ramirez-Valverde et al. [] compared the accuracy of EBV from threshold animal  threshold sire-maternal grandsire  linear animal and linear sire-maternal grandsire models for calving difficulty in beef cattle and determined that the accuracy of EBV from the threshold model was 10% higher than from the linear model for animal and sire-maternal grandsire models. Casellas et al. [] analyzed litter size using linear and threshold models and found better goodness-of-fit and predictive ability for EBV from a threshold model than for a linear model. Table  shows the Spearman rank correlations among GEBV ( and ) in the Angus (PV) and multibreed (MV) validation populations after estimating the substitution effects from the 50k panel without QTL using the Bayes C  linear () model analysis of continuous phenotypes and Bayes C  linear () or threshold () model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes. The rank correlations between  and  ranged from 0.52 to 0.89 in the PV validation population and from 0.48 to 0.85 in the MV validation population. Categorical phenotypes classified by 2 or 3 scores resulted in higher rank correlations among the alternative analyses than when categorical phenotypes were classified by 4 scores across heritabilities and training population sizes. However  the rank correlations were not affected when heritabilities and training population sizes increased. The rank correlations between  and   and between  and  indicated that the Bayes C  linear () model analysis of continuous phenotypes and Bayes C  threshold () model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes resulted in GEBV with a similar ranking than the Bayes C  linear () model analysis of continuous phenotypes and Bayes C  linear () model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes across heritabilities  number of categories and training population sizes. Vazquez et al. [] compared Poisson  logit and linear models for accuracy of EBV for clinical mastitis in Norwegian Red cows. They found that the type of model  linear or nonlinear  had an impact on accuracy and the ranking of sires. Guerra et al. [] and Marcondes et al. [] studied linear and threshold models for the analysis of calving rate and calf survival in a multibreed beef cattle population and for the analysis of stayability for Nellore cows and found that the two models resulted in EBV with very similar rankings (rank correlation = 97%). The presence of bias in GEBV was evaluated by regressing true () genotypic values of validation animals on their predicted () genotypic values (Table ). These regression coefficients tended to differ from the expected value of 1. Regression coefficients for the MV validation population were lower than those for the PV validation population  regardless of heritability  training population size  model of analysis and the number of categories  when the PT training population was purebred. GEBV were found to be more biased with 1000 observations than with 2250 observations in the training population. Generally  when heritability and training population size increased  bias reduced. The least bias occurred when the phenotype was continuous. The threshold model resulted in greater bias than analysis of a continuous phenotype. Some of the worst bias occurred when the data was categorical but analyzed as if it was continuous using a linear model. Generally the more biased predictions were associated with lower accuracy. Saatchi et al. [] indicated that traits in US Angus that presented the highest bias i.e. having regressions of deregressed estimated breeding values (DEBV) on DGV different from 1  also exhibited less accuracy  regardless of the number of animals with DEBV. Table  shows the estimates of heritabilities on the underlying scale across heritabilities  training population size  and number of categories. Bayes C  linear model analysis of continuous phenotypes resulted in downward bias of heritability estimates for training population sizes with 1000 and 2250 observations  except for a heritability of 0.10 and a training population size with 1000 observations. Increasing training population size from 1000 to 2250 did not help improve the estimates of heritabilities. Bayes C  threshold model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes resulted in upward or downward bias of heritability estimates on the underlying scale for training population sizes of 1000 or 2250. The increase in training population size resulted in similar estimates of heritabilities on the underlying scale from Bayes C  linear model analysis of continuous phenotypes and Bayes C  threshold model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes. However  the estimates of heritabilities on the underlying scale from Bayes C  linear model analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes were found to be significantly downward biased for training population sizes with 1000 and 2250 observations. In some practical settings  linear model analyses perform as well as threshold model analyses as discussed above. This is expected because as the number of categories increases  the distribution of the data tends towards a normal distribution. The worst scenario is for binomial data and although not significant  the trends for accuracy of predictions tend to be poorer for two compared to three or four categories  as in Figure . The performance of analyses of binomial data treated as continuous also eroded as the observed frequency departed from 0.5. In the simulations presented here  the distributions of ordered categorical scores were chosen to reflect those commonly observed  namely a majority of observations in one extreme category  and successively fewer scores in each successive category. In data in which the distribution of scores is spread more evenly  the loss in accuracy from using categorical scores rather than measuring a continuous variable will be smaller than that observed here  which indicates that it will not be necessary to increase training population size by as much as 2.25 fold to achieve the accuracy for continuous phenotypes with a training population size of 1000 animals. The distribution of outcomes across categories can also differ between fixed class variables such as herd-year-season. The simulation reported here used only one fixed class effect with three similarly represented levels. It is difficult to simulate data to represent all situations that might be encountered with field data  but we believe the parameters we have chosen will provide indicative values for relative information content of continuous data compared to that measured with categorical scores. Genomic prediction of ordinal categorical phenotypes was carried out using Bayes C  threshold and linear models. Results indicated that there was a clear loss in accuracy of GEBV from the analysis of ordinal categorical phenotypes compared to that of continuous phenotypes. This loss was found to depend on training population size  heritability  model of analysis and number of categories. The accuracies of GEBV for ordinal categorical phenotypes analyzed by the threshold model were higher than those with a linear model applied to the scores  and the advantage of a threshold model was greatest when training populations were small. Accuracy of GEBV in a purebred validation population was greater than in a multibreed validation population; however  this difference became smaller when training population size increased. A 2.25 fold increase in training population size for ordinal categorical phenotypes analyzed using a threshold model was sufficient to achieve an accuracy equal to or greater than that for continuous phenotypes with a training population size of 1000 animals.

Genome-wide dense marker arrays that are available for livestock populations cover all chromosomes with dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers []. Many dairy cattle populations are currently being genotyped using these arrays [–]. The main objective is to apply genomic selection (GS) []. GS allows prediction of the genetic merit of young animals based on marker information in the absence of own performance data. The marker effects are estimated in a reference population  which must have both genotypic and phenotypic records. In the case of dairy bulls  phenotypic data come from genetic evaluations in the form of daughter yield deviation (DYD) or deregressed estimated breeding values (dEBV) []. Identity by descent (IBD) alleles refer to alleles that descend from a common ancestor in the base population []. The coefficient of coancestry between two animals is defined as the probability that two randomly sampled alleles from the two animals are IBD []  and twice the coancestry is defined as their numerator relationship []. This approach leads to the estimation of a matrix of relationships based on the pedigree information. The latter is fundamental to estimate the genetic parameters for complex traits such as heritability (defined as the proportion of the phenotypic variance in a population that is attributed to additive genetic effects). The relationship matrix based on pedigree data dates back to a base population  for which parents are unknown and which is considered unrelated  unselected and non-inbred. The choice of the base population affects the estimate of the additive genetic variance []. However  the relationship matrix can also be estimated from genome-wide genetic markers such as panels of SNPs [–]. Methods have been developed to construct such marker-based relationship matrices [–]. Recently  these relationship matrices have been used to dissect the additive genetic variance of complex traits []. The proportion of the genetic variance not captured by markers () represents the variance that cannot be used by GS and affects the maximum accuracy that can be achieved by GS []. The term ‘missing heritability’ [] describes the fact that marker-phenotype associations identified in genome-wide association studies do not explain all the genetic variance in complex traits (e.g. height in humans). Some strategies have been proposed to reduce : (1) increasing the sample size in order to also detect genes with smaller effects  (2) expanding the studies to non-European samples in human genetics  (3) enlarging the collection of phenotypes to explore gene-gene interactions  (4) changing the structure of the training population  mainly in terms of the relatedness of the included individuals  and (5) moving to the genomic selection approach instead of estimating the marker effect for each SNP individually [    ]. In animal breeding  some results suggest that the Illumina Bovine54K chip array (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) does not capture all the additive genetic variation for all dairy traits [–]  even when using the GS approach  it estimates simultaneously all the SNP effects. The main objective of this study was to estimate the fraction of the genetic variance not explained by the 54 K Illumina SNP chip. Two alternative marker-based relationship matrices were used for analysis. A total of 1092 Italian Brown Swiss bulls were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine54K chip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA). These bulls were born between 1963 and 2002. Figure  shows the distribution of the genotyped bulls over the birth years. All the SNPs on the X-chromosome were excluded from the analysis  which left 51 582 markers. The quality control process removed 1421 SNPs that had more than 5% missing genotypes and 14 455 SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 5%. Six sires were deleted because their genotyping rate was lower than 95%. Editing was performed with two different software packages: SAS (SAS Inst. Inc.  Cary  NC) and PLINK v1.07 []. At the end of the quality control process  genotypes were available for 1086 sires with 35 706 SNPs and with a missing genotype rate of 0.66%.                                                      The phenotypic data available were the EBV for fat yield (FAT)  milk yield (MILK)  protein yield (PROT) and somatic cell score in milk (SCS) for each bull  which were calculated by the Italian National Association of Brown Swiss (ANARB). The EBV were deregressed as proposed by Garrick []  in order to eliminate the shrinkage contained in the EBV and to remove ancestral information. The deregressed EBV (dEBV) were used as phenotypic records for the bulls with heritability equal to the reliability of the EBV. Three subsets were formed according to the reliability of EBV as follows: animals with a reliability of at least 50% for each trait; animals with a reliability greater than 70% for each trait; animals with a reliability of at least 90% for each trait. A pedigree file was extracted from the Italian Brown Swiss herd book. Pedigree was traced back five generations and the pedigree file included 6826 entries. The completeness in the pedigree was 100% up to the grandparents  and decreased to ~90% thereafter. The equivalent number of known generations as calculated by the software Pedig [] was on average 5.14 and the median was 5.23. The pedigree file was used to estimate the additive genetic relationships () with an adapted version of the procedure proposed by Meuwissen and Luo []  as implemented in ASREML []. Two genomic relationship matrices () were computed for all genotyped animals. The first  was based on the method proposed by VanRaden []. Let  be the marker-genotype matrix with number of individuals (n) and number of loci (m) as dimensions. The elements in the matrix  were coded as -1 (homozygous for one allele) 0 (heterozygous) and 1 for (homozygous for the other allele). The nxm matrix  contains columns with all elements 2(-0.5)  where  is the frequency of the second allele at locus . The matrix  was subtracted from  to give . Finally  matrix  was calculated as: The second genomic relationship matrix () was computed as: where  is the  matrix but with each element scaled based on the allele frequency of each locus as follows: [  ]. Both the  matrix and the pedigree-based relationship matrix    are expressed relative to a base population  i.e. an original population in which all animals are assumed unrelated and non-inbred  and these populations may differ between the pedigree-based and genomic relationship matrices []. To correct for these differences  the scale of  was changed to that of  based on Wright’s F-statistic []. We expressed the total inbreeding of animal  in the  matrix as: where  is the average inbreeding in the population  i.e. the average of the diagonal elements of  minus 1  and  is the inbreeding of animal  relative to the population average inbreeding   which is calculated as:  The average population inbreeding of  was set equal to that of  by rescaling the diagonal element of  corresponding to individual  as: Where  is the average of the diagonals of  minus 1. The off-diagonals of  were rescaled similarly  using the same  and  values. Numerator relationships were transformed to kinships    i.e. by dividing the relationship by 2  and performing the base-correction on the kinship level  which is the same level as that of inbreeding  i.e. where <U+2009> is the kinship of animal  and  relative to the base population inbreeding  . To estimate the fraction of the genetic variance captured by dense markers covering the entire genome  the approach of Goddard et al. [] was used. Both matrix  and  were fitted in the model simultaneously in order to estimate the fraction of the genetic variance captured by each of these matrices. The variance component analyses were performed by ASREML-R []  using the following model: where  is the vector of the dEBV; µ is the overall mean;  and  are the incidence matrices for pedigree-based and genomic random animal effects  respectively;  is the vector of the random additive genetic animal effects using the pedigree-based relationship matrix  with  ~ N(0   s);  is the vector of random additive genetic effect using the genomic relationship matrix  with  ~ N(0   s); and finally   is the vector of random residual effects. Because the number of daughters per bull was high for all bulls  the reliabilities of the dEBV were high and varied little between bulls  and a homogeneous error variance structure was assumed. If we assume that  is an unbiased estimate of   and write <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>[]  where  is a matrix of deviations from pedigree relationships due to the segregation of a finite number of chromosome segments in the genome  the genetic variance of the records becomes ()<U+2009>=<U+2009> s<U+2009>+<U+2009> s<U+2009>=<U+2009>(s<U+2009>+<U+2009>s)<U+2009>+<U+2009> s. Hence  as in a model that fits only pedigree relationships (<U+2009>=<U+2009> µ<U+2009>+<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>)  the total genetic variance is explained by the  matrix and the segregation of chromosome segments that are traced by the markers is explained by s. The fraction of genetic variance not captured by the markers on the SNP chip () was thus estimated as: where  is the total genetic variance   is the variance due to marker-based relationships and  is the variance due to pedigree-based relationships. The two additive genetic variances were also estimated by fitting each separately: the additive genetic animal variance using the pedigree-based relationship matrix () and the additive genetic variance using the genomic relationship matrix (). The estimate of  was used to calculate an alternative estimate for the fraction of genetic variance not addressed by the markers on the SNP chip () as follows: . The estimate   has the advantage that  is known to yield an unbiased estimate of the genetic variance  but it has the disadvantage that  is likely to include more genetic variance than that explained by QTL that are in LD with the markers []. E.g. if only some of the chromosomes contain markers  these markers can explain genetic variance at the unmarked chromosomes  because the markers trace family relationships. If  in the latter case  the pedigree-based relationship matrix is fitted simultaneously with the marker-based relationship matrix  the variance due to the unmarked chromosomes is expected to be included in the polygenic variance    because the pedigree-based relationship matrix more closely resembles the family relationships at the unmarked chromosomes than at the marked chromosomes  which may show relationships that (randomly) deviate from the pedigree. Thus   is expected to underestimate the fraction of missing genetic variance. Descriptive statistics for each trait and dataset are in Table . In the group of bulls with dEBV reliabilities of at least 50%  the dEBV average reliability was ~90% (±7%) for the production traits (FAT  PROT and MILK)  and 82.6% (±10.7%) for SCS. The subset of sires with dEBV reliabilities of at least 70% had a similar average reliability of ~91% (±5%) for the production traits. The lowest average reliability in this subset was 85.7% (±7.4%) for SCS. Finally  the subset of bulls with reliabilities of at least 90% had an average reliability close to ~94% (±3%) for all traits. As expected  the differences in the average of the reliabilities between traits tended to decrease with increasing minimum reliability requirements. The fraction of genetic variance not explained by molecular markers based on  was estimated for all datasets (50  70 and 90 dEBV reliabilities) and traits (FAT  PROT  MILK and SCS). Results are in Table . For dFAT50  the estimate of  was 0.373<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.068 based on  and 0.363<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.069 based on . The estimates of  were smaller for the dFAT70 subset than for the dFAT50 subset. For dFAT90  the estimate was 0.305<U+2009>± 0.074   while the  matrix did not result in converged variance component estimates. Algorithms other than the AI-REML algorithm might have converged (e.g. the EM-algorithm  which is known to be slow)  but the convergence difficulties are probably due to the small size of the dataset  thus resulting variance component estimates would have been unreliable. The fraction of the genetic variance not explained by molecular markers based on  through the additive genetic variances was estimated separately for all datasets and traits (Table ). Results for  followed the same trends as for  but the values of  were lower probably due to its underestimation of the fraction of the missing genetic variance. Results for dMILK  dPROT and dSCS were similar to those described above for dFAT for both genomic relationship matrices. Estimates of  for dMILK70 and dPROT70 hardly differed from those for dMILK50 and dPROT50  respectively. The subsets with dEBV90 resulted in estimates of  of 0.199 (±0.101) for dMILK90 and 0.206 (±0.098) for dPROT90 when using . These estimates were not significantly different from those obtained with the larger datasets for the same traits (dEBV50 or dEBV70)  although they were systematically lower for all traits. The highest estimates for  were obtained for dSCS50  with 0.532 (±0.091) for . When using   the corresponding  estimate was lower (0.486<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.095). The smallest  estimate was obtained for dSCS90: 0.061 (±0.197) using . The variance component analysis with  on the same dataset did not converge. This was the smallest dataset and  although the average reliability was the highest  estimates of  were not significantly different from 0. In general  estimates of  decreased as the reliability of the dEBV increased. Estimates of  differed from estimates of   probably because  is expected to underestimate the fraction of the missing genetic variance. We estimated the fraction of the genetic variance not accounted by SNPs in the marker panel () based on the Illumina 54 K SNP chip for complex traits in dairy cattle. The results showed that the estimates of  depended on the reliability of the phenotypic traits considered  i.e. the dEBV used as response values. When the accuracy of the dEBV increases  i.e. when the correlation between dEBV and the true breeding value increases  the proportion of the genetic variance explained by SNPs tended to increase. When the reliability of the dEBV is low  the family/pedigree information greatly contributes to the estimation of the EBV  which results in a larger fraction of the variance being explained by  and  in turn  in upward biases of . Because the estimates of the  values  are expected to be overestimated due to the use of (family information in) dEBV  the best estimates of  are obtained for data sets with high reliabilities  which resulted in estimates around 0.2. This implies that the maximum accuracy of GEBV is v(1-)<U+2009>˜<U+2009>0.9  which agrees with the result of Daetwyler []  who studied the increase in the accuracy of GEBV with increasing training population sizes. For all production traits  the fraction of the genetic variance not explained by the SNPs was significantly different from 0  even when the phenotypes were very accurate (reliability<U+2009>><U+2009>90%)  and were  therefore  very close to the true breeding values. Correction for the base population did not affect the fraction of the genetic variance explained by markers for any of the marker-based relationships here used. The differences in  estimates between using  and  were negligible for all traits and all subsets. Similarly  when using EBV instead of dEBV (results not shown)  the results were virtually the same. If original performance records of production and SCS phenotypes are used to estimates   instead of dEBV  the upward biases mentioned above are not expected to occur. The error variances would be higher than when using dEBV  but the value of s would not be inflated  because family information does not contribute to own phenotype (in contrast to dEBV phenotypes). The sources of phenotypic information used in genomic analyses are very heterogeneous and vary from individuals with highly reliable information  i.e. progeny-tested bulls  and animals with phenotypes with low levels of accuracy  i.e. young cows. To take into account these differences in reliability in a weighted analysis  it is necessary to know the value of  for each phenotype []. In addition  a polygenic effect must be included in the model to account for unmarked genetic effects. Knowledge of the fraction of the genetic variance not explained by markers is also required to predict the accuracy of the genomic predictions for each individual in the population  since it affects the maximum accuracy that can be achieved []. The base population correction of the genomic relationship matrix generally affected neither the proportion of genetic variance captured by markers  nor the genetic variance captured by the pedigree-based relationship matrices  which agrees with [  ] but not with []. The latter authors  however  scaled the relationships in the opposite direction  i.e. when G relationships were too high  they scaled all relationships downwards  which further decreased the differences in relationships that were already small since relationships are bound by a maximum of 1 (and vice-versa when G relationships were too small). Moreover  the correction for the base population facilitates the integration of relationship matrices  and  into a single matrix ()  according to Legarra et al. []  Christensen and Lund []  and Meuwissen et al. []. We also estimated  using the pedigree-based estimate of genetic variance. The denominators of  and  were significantly different from each other but both estimates revealed that the genomic relationship matrix could explain more than 95% of genetic variance if sufficiently reliable phenotypes are used (with reliabilities greater than 95%). It should be noted that the estimates of  and  depend on the SNP chip used  i.e. more dense SNP chips are expected to yield lower estimates of  and  (a larger fraction of the variance is explained by the SNPs)  and also on the family structure of the population []. Populations with more closely related individuals are expected to yield high LD between SNPs and QTL  even when they are physically quite far apart and  therefore  lower estimates of . The population structure of the Italian Brown Swiss population reflects that of a typical dairy breeding population  and  thus  our results probably apply also to other dairy breeding populations. The fraction of genetic variance explained by genetic markers from high-density SNP panels was significantly different from 0 for the complex traits analyzed when the phenotypes are not highly accurate. The minimum fraction of the genetic variance not explained by the markers () was equal to 0.2  which was estimated based on the most accurate phenotypes. This value agrees with other values reported in the literature. Correction of the genomic relationship matrix for the variance of the allele frequency of each locus () instead of the average frequency of heterozygotes ()  hardly explained any additional genetic variance. Our estimate of  of 0.2 implies that about 80% of the genetic variance is explained by the Illumina 54 K SNP chip. Values for  are expected to depend on the density of the chip (a larger SNP chip is expected to explain a larger fraction of the genetic variance) and on family relationships in the population  i.e. closer family relationships are expected to reduce .

The small size of the regions identified here will facilitate the search for causal genetic variations that affect gene functions. Mastitis is the endemic disease that causes the greatest economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide []. Therefore  genetic improvement through the selection of animals with a greater ability to resist or combat infection is a major breeding goal. Since a moderate to high positive genetic correlation exists between clinical mastitis and milk somatic cell count (SCC) or its logarithmic transformation (somatic cell score  SCS) [–]  SCC and SCS have been widely used to monitor mastitis in dairy farms  although variation in SCS may be associated with different environmental conditions  different pathogens  and different physiological statuses of the animal []. SCS is used as an indicator trait for mastitis. Since clinical mastitis and SCS have low heritabilities in dairy cattle  equal to 0.10 and 0.16  respectively  traditional breeding for mastitis resistance is difficult [  ]. Therefore  selection based on genomic information could be an interesting alternative []. Since genomic selection has been introduced into breeding programs  genome-wide information on SCS has been used effectively to estimate genomic breeding values for SCS. However  most SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) used for genomic selection are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with unknown causative mutations. Due to recombination between indirect markers and causative mutations  the marker effects may need to be re-estimated from time to time. Therefore  to circumvent reevaluation of SNP effects and to understand the biological mechanism behind gene variants  it is necessary to identify the causative mutations. An essential step to achieve this is the accurate mapping of genomic loci that contribute to the trait. Compared to QTL (quantitative trait loci) studies that are performed using pedigrees  genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the power to detect smaller chromosomal regions affecting a trait and to provide more precise estimates of the size and direction of the effects of alleles at identified loci. Recent GWAS using SNPs in US  Irish  Dutch  Scottish  and Swedish Holstein cattle identified SNPs associated with SCS on chromosomes 2  4  5  6  7  10  11  12  13  15  16  18  20  25  26  28 and X [–]. While previous GWAS for mastitis traits in dairy cattle used SNPs  haplotype-based approaches can be more powerful for genomic regions for which allele frequencies of the tested SNP and the unknown causative mutation are different. In a population  a SNP has at most two alleles but a haplotype block can have more than two haplotypes []. A haplotype block consists of two or more polymorphic loci (. SNPs) in close proximity  which tend to be inherited together with high probability. While the term allele refers to one of alternative DNA sequences at a single polymorphic locus  haplotype refers to the combination of alleles of polymorphic loci in a haplotype block on one chromosome. The combination of two haplotypes that an individual carries within a block (or homologous haplotypes) builds a diplotype  analogous to genotype for a single polymorphic locus. A haplotype can have higher LD with the allele of a QTL than individual SNP alleles that are used to construct the haplotype. Therefore  haplotypes can better separate carriers of each QTL allele and thus have larger effects than individual SNPs. Furthermore  haplotypes can also have larger effects if they combine multiple mutations on a chromosomal region that affect the trait in the same direction  which increases the power to identify genomic regions for the trait  even if they have small effects []. However  haplotypes can also have smaller effects if they combine QTL allele variants with effects in opposite directions. Due to the low heritability of SCS [  ]  small QTL effects are expected []. Thus  GWAS using haplotype information in addition to using individual SNPs could shed new light on the genetic determinants that are not captured by the single-marker approach. Therefore  the objective of this study was to identify genomic regions that contribute to differences in SCS using both SNP and haplotype information derived from genotyped SNPs. Data were obtained from 2402 German Holstein bulls for which daughter yield deviations (DYD) for SCS were available in August 2012. The bulls were born between 1981 and 2003  with more than 97% born after 1998. Data from the National Breeding Evaluation (  Verden  Germany) were available for the first three lactations. On average  each bull had 937 daughters contributing to its DYD and the mean reliability of the DYD was 88% (ranging from 72 to 99%). Estimation of DYD was based on the random regression animal model using the original daily yield records from 5 to 365 days in milk []. Since DYD for SCS of bulls are based on the performance data of all their daughters  adjusted for environmental effects  they are highly reliable and more accurate than the individual performance data of cows. In addition  the DYD describes the genetic value of a bull more accurately than its estimated breeding value due to the adjustment for the daughters’ dams []. The bulls used were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 v1 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA  USA)  which features 54 001 SNPs across all autosomes and the X chromosome []. The genotyping was conducted after ethical review and approval by the committee of the GenoTrack project  reference number: 0315 134B. The SNP data from this chip were subjected to rigorous validation by the remapping procedure of Schmitt et al. [] against the reference assembly of the bovine genome (University of Maryland bovine genome assembly  UMD3.1) []. This procedure mapped 53 872 oligomer sequences to a unique chromosomal position and defined 129 ambiguous SNP positions as missing due to substantial deviations between the manufacturer’s specification and the mapping strategy. During quality control  which was conducted using PLINK  release 1.07 []  7976 and 745 markers were excluded due to a low minor allele frequency (MAF<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and a low genotyping rate (<90% missing)  respectively. Forty-eight animals were discarded because they had a high rate of missing genotypes (>10%). Furthermore  1082 SNPs showed significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions and were carefully examined. Since they did not show significant associations with SCS  they were excluded from further analyses. In total  44 576 SNPs and 2354 bulls passed the quality control. The genotyping rate of the remaining individuals was 99.3%. The subset of SNPs covered 2649.52 Mb of the bovine genome with an average distance of 59.5 kb between adjacent markers. Haplotypes for each chromosome were constructed using the default options in fastPHASE [] on whole chromosomes with 10 random starts (parameter -T) and 25 iterations (parameter-C). Phased genotypes were partitioned into haplotype blocks using the solid spine algorithm implemented in the software Haploview  version 4.1 []. This algorithm defines a haplotype block if the first and last SNP in a region are in strong LD (D´<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.8) with all intermediate SNPs  but the intermediate SNPs do not need to be in LD with each other. Haplotypes with a minor allele frequency below 0.01 and a genotyping error rate greater than 0.10 were excluded from further analyses. After quality control  11 704 haplotype blocks containing 37 424 SNPs were inferred and used for GWAS. These haplotype blocks comprised 52 422 haplotypes and covered 1301.68 Mb of the genome (sum of regions between the first and last SNP in a haplotype block) with an average of three SNPs per haplotype block. The number of SNPs per haplotype block ranged from 2 to 17  with more than 95% of haplotype blocks containing two to six SNPs. To prevent false positive associations from confounding effects  we accounted for potential population substructure using the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) approach implemented in PLINK []  using a pairwise population concordance (PPC) test based on an identity-by-state (IBS) similarity matrix. The MDS approach measures the similarity of alleles between independent loci (SNPs that are not in LD   r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.02) using an IBS similarity matrix across all N genotyped individuals based on the number of markers that individuals share. Then  a cluster analysis was carried out on the N*N IBS matrix []. The scaling process resulted in 157 significant clusters  representing axes of ancestry (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Fitting these clusters as covariates in the model for GWAS led to a reduction of the genomic inflation factor (<U+03BB>) from 4.4 to 1.5. Genomic control is commonly used in GWAS to check whether spurious associations from population stratification are eliminated []. The idea behind this calculation is that a small number of SNPs should show a true association with a trait of interest  while the other SNPs should follow the distribution under the null hypothesis of no SNP being associated []. The inflation factor <U+03BB> is the ratio of the observed median of the  test statistic characterizing association between the phenotype and genetic markers and the expected median of this test statistic under the null hypothesis of no association predicted by theory (0.455 for 1df in association tests using the additive model). Thus  <U+03BB> is a measure for the extent of the inflation of the excess of type 1 error []. Due to differences in allele frequencies caused by population stratification  observed values of the test statistic can be inflated above their expectations under the null hypothesis []. To prevent false negative associations  we included the most significant SNPs of a genome-wide scan as covariates into the model in a stepwise manner  to detect additional loci []. The stepwise adjustments for the most significant SNP effects led to a further reduction of <U+03BB> to 1.4. The GWAS was performed using the linear regression procedure implemented in PLINK []  where the DYD for SCS were regressed on the number of copies of a particular allele at the SNP using the PLINK linear option  including population stratification as covariates. SNPs and haplotypes were considered significant at a genome-wide threshold of a<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 after Bonferroni correction if the nominal  value<U+2009>×<U+2009>K was less than or equal to 0.05  where K is the number of tests conducted in the GWAS; K<U+2009>=<U+2009>44 576 for SNP analyses and K<U+2009>=<U+2009>52 422 for haplotype analyses. To visualize the GWAS results  Manhattan plots of -log value were generated using Haploview  version 4.1 []. Then  a Bonferroni test was performed to test phenotypic differences between either genotype or haplotype groups of significant SNPs or haplotype blocks  respectively  using SAS® software  version 9.2 (SAS® Institute Inc.  2008  Cary  NC  USA). To estimate the additive genetic variance explained by a single SNP or haplotype  we used the formula 2 (1-)  where  denotes the estimate of the allele substitution effect; . the effect of the locus per copy of the variant allele  and  denotes the frequency of the variant allele. For haplotypes  the ‘allele substitution’ effect depends on the haplotype that is set to zero. Briefly  the genetic variance calculated by this method determines the contribution of the SNP or haplotype to the additive genetic variance based on its estimated effect and haplotype/allele frequency under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and an additive polygenic model []. In several dairy cattle breeds  non-zero levels of LD (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06) among markers were reported to extend up to 1 Mb []. Therefore  we used 5' and 3' flanking regions of 1 Mb around a significant SNP or up- and downstream from a significant haplotype block to search for candidate genes  which could be responsible for the observed significant associations with SCS. The start and end positions of genes were extracted from the Ensembl database (UMD3.1 Ensembl data base build 73  ). SNPs and haplotype blocks were assigned to genes using an Ensembl Perl API tool () through a homemade Perl script () to identify all possible genes within the flanking regions that could be in LD with the causative mutation. Gene ontology analysis was performed using a Perl script () to extract the functional annotation derived from UniProtKB/Swiss () and GeneCards (). A gene was selected as a candidate if the gene ontology annotations associated with the gene included immune-related functions. In the genome-wide analysis of 2354 progeny tested bulls  16 SNPs reached genome-wide significance for association with DYD for SCS (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.14<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  Table  and Figure ). Among these SNPs  three were located on BTA5 between 97.4 and 98.6 Mb  two on BTA6 between 85.5 and 88.1 Mb  five on BTA13 between 78.6 and 83.3 Mb  two on BTA18 between 43.3 and 43.4 Mb  three on BTA19 between 50.6 and 52.4 Mb  and one on BTAX at 30.6 Mb (Figure ) and (see Additional file : Figures S1  S2  S3  S4 and S5). The haplotype analysis did not identify other genomic regions than those detected by single-marker analysis. Among the 10 haplotypes that were significantly associated with SCS on the five autosomes (<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  Table )  eight harbored significant SNPs  while the other two haplotypes were either between significant SNPs   on BTA6  or located very close to a significant SNP   on BTA13 (Figure ) and (see Additional file : Figures S1  S2  S3  S4 and S5). No additional SNP was identified after the stepwise adjustments for the effect of these significant SNPs (see Additional file : Table S1).  The Manhattan plot demonstrates the results of association after correction for population structure; the horizontal blue line indicates the whole-genome significance threshold after Bonferroni correction at a<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.14<U+2009>×<U+2009>10).

The genetic variance explained by all significant SNPs considered together was equal to 5.4% of the total genetic variance of the analyzed population  while the estimated variance for each significant SNP separately ranged from 0.25 to 0.44% (Table ). The genetic variance explained by all significant haplotypes was equal to 3.7% and ranged from 0.26 to 0.54% for each haplotype separately (Table ). The sum of the estimated variances attributed to the leading SNPs for each haplotype block that contained significant haplotypes ( the SNPs with the lowest -value for a significant haplotype) accounted for 2.7% of the total genetic variance. The most significant SNP (<U+2009>=<U+2009>9.04<U+2009>×<U+2009>10  effect size for the minor allele equal to -0.10 units of DYD for SCS) was located on BTA19 ( at 52.44 Mb)  while the SNPs with the largest favorable effect size (-0.12 units of DYD for SCS) were on BTA13 ( at 78.64 Mb  <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.55<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and  at 83.24 Mb  <U+2009>=<U+2009>1.50<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and BTA19 ( at 50.65 Mb<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.19<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) (Table ). The SNP on BTA19 () was also located in the most significant haplotype ( 50.55 to 50.65 Mb  <U+2009>=<U+2009>2.64<U+2009>×<U+2009>10) and which had the largest favorable effect size (-0.12 units of DYD for SCS) (Table ). Interestingly  the most frequent SNP alleles in the identified genomic regions on BTA6 and BTAX were associated with lower DYD for SCS  which indicates lower mastitis incidence (Table ). Nonetheless  the significant haplotypes on BTA6  which were also the most frequent (0.32 to 0.38)  were associated with an increase in SCS (Table ). In the genomic regions on BTA18 and 19  all alleles with negative effects on SCS were the minor SNP alleles; the significant haplotypes on BTA18 and 19 also had a low frequency and were associated with reductions in SCS (Tables  and ). The regions identified on BTA5 and BTA13 contained both types of alleles  highly frequent favorable and highly frequent unfavorable alleles. On BTA5  the major alleles of the two distal SNPs ( and )  with frequencies of 0.61 and 0.64  respectively  were associated with lower SCS  while the major allele of the third significant SNP ( with a frequency of 0.65) was associated with higher SCS. The significant haplotype in this region decreased SCS and was the most frequent haplotype (0.35). Interestingly  the frequencies (0.35) and the proportion of genetic variance explained (0.37%) were the same for allele G of the SNP  (SNP number 4 in the haplotype block) and the haplotype TCAG of the haplotype block BTA5_Hap5 (Tables  and ). On BTA13  the major alleles of four of the five significant SNPs were associated with lower DYD for SCS; an exception was the SNP in the middle  for which the minor allele (frequency equal to 0.42) was the favorable one (Table ). All significant haplotypes of the associated haplotype block on BTA13 (frequencies between 0.12 and 0.34) were associated with high SCS (Table ). Opposing effects of the major alleles of the SNPs in a region that are significantly associated with SCS could indicate the presence of different mutations in this region or loss of linkage with the causal mutation(s) due to historic recombination between the significant SNPs and the linked mutation. Using SNP and haplotype data  we identified six genomic regions associated with DYD for SCS. The identified regions on BTA5  6  18 and 19 are in regions where previously reported QTL for clinical mastitis and/or SCS have been mapped by linkage analyses in structured pedigrees (See Additional file : Figure S6). Most interesting is the significant region on BTA6 from our GWAS  which coincided with QTL that have repeatedly been mapped for SCS in German and French Holstein cattle []  for clinical mastitis in Danish Holstein cattle []  and in a GWAS for SCS in US Holstein cattle []. The GWAS in US Holstein cattle identified three SNPs between 85.2 and 88.90 Mb on BTA6 associated with SCS that are located in the same region than that identified in our study. Although the same BovineSNP50 BeadChip was used in the US Holstein cattle study []  different SNPs in this region were significantly associated with SCS in our study. The identified region on BTA5 is located in a QTL region for SCS that was found in US Holstein cattle []. The significant SNPs on BTA18 and 19 were also supported by known QTL in German and French Holstein cattle [  ]. Our study did not identify associations in QTL regions that had been previously reported with suggestive significance in German Holstein cattle by linkage analyses  .  QTL identified on BTA2 []  BTA7  BTA10  and BTA27 []. Although  many significant regions identified by GWAS [–] overlap with QTL from linkage studies  several regions were only identified by GWAS (see Additional file : Figure S6). With respect to our study  the regions on BTA13 and BTAX have not been reported before to be associated with SCS  neither in Holstein nor in other cattle breeds (). The regions detected in our study are representative of the German Holstein population since almost all German breeding sires contributed to the analyzed bull population. Loci that were identified in other populations but not in the present analysis probably have too small effects to be detected in the German Holstein sire population  have different LD  are not segregating in the German Holstein population  or were false positives in the other studies. An important factor for GWAS is the elimination of spurious associations that may result from relationships among individuals []. In the current study  we accounted for population stratification using the genomic information of every bull. Ideally  the inflation factor  <U+03BB>  for genomic control should be equal to 1  which would reflect the assumption that only a small fraction of the tested loci show true associations []. In the current study  even after correction for population stratification effects  <U+03BB> had a value of 1.5. This inflation may be explained by the polygenic nature of SCS  with a large number of contributing loci  each with a small effect  and/or by causative mutations being in LD with multiple genotyped SNPs [–]. Compared to linkage studies in German Holstein cattle  which provided large confidence intervals for QTL  our GWAS using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip identified much smaller chromosomal regions  with lengths ranging from 0.05 to 5.62 Mb. GWAS uses historical recombination events over many generations across the genome  including those in the interval surrounding a mutation that affects a trait. Thus  GWAS can narrow detected effects to relatively small genomic regions linked to an associated SNP in the population  in which only few genes reside []. In most cases  SNPs identified by GWAS are not causative mutations themselves  but merely linked to one or several causative mutations. Although the significant SNPs or haplotypes identified by GWAS may not represent the causative mutation  the identified significant intervals are much smaller than the QTL intervals that result from linkage analysis of pedigrees. For instance  the QTL on BTA6 identified in [] (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04  chromosome-wise)  with a peak QTL position at 99 cM (˜90 Mb) and a 95% confidence interval from 16 to 135 cM (˜14.5 to 122.7 Mb)  could be reduced in our study to a 3.1 Mb interval from 85.1 and 88.2 Mb. Likewise  the QTL previously identified on BTA18 with a peak QTL position at 72.55 cM (˜46.2 Mb) and a 95% confidence interval from 64.1 to 74.6 cM (˜40.8 to 47.5 Mb) [] was located in a 0.05 Mb interval in our study. Of particular interest is the region on BTA6 between about 85 and 89 Mb  which has been associated with mastitis traits in several studies [    ]. In our study  the region between 85.1 and 88.2 Mb was significant  which contains the following candidate genes:  ()   ()   ()  and  (  also known as ) (Tables  and ).  plays an important role in the activation of the pro-macrophage-stimulating protein []  which induces macrophage spreading  migration  phagocytosis  and cytokine production. It also inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammatory mediators [–].  has a functional role for drug resistance and sensitivity [] and  regulates the structure and function of IgM polymers secreted by B cells [] and helps to bind immunoglobulins with secretory components [].  is a multifunctional protein that associates with membrane-bound immunoglobulin on the surface of B-lymphocytes [] and with the IgG receptor on the membranes of T-lymphocytes []. Although all significant associations were observed in regions for which both SNPs and haplotypes had effects  some haplotypes did not contain significant SNPs (BTA6_Hap8  and BTA13_Hap34). This is attributed to the nature of the haplotype-based methods  which can better detect functional haplotypes such as -interactions among multiple DNA variants in a haplotype block region [  ]  which is an advantage of haplotype analysis compared to the SNP analysis. Likewise  some significantly associated SNPs did not belong to a haplotype block ( and  on BTA5;  on BTA19)  or they were located in haplotype blocks that did not show significant associations (    and  on BTA13;  on BTA19;  on BTAX). The power for detecting association is maximized if the frequencies of a specific marker allele and a causal DNA variant are similar. LD can be high only if the two alleles (the observed marker allele and the hidden causal mutation) have a similar frequency and are located on the same chromosome. Forming haplotypes with several contiguous SNPs in a block could change the combination of SNP alleles ( haplotypes) on a chromosome and reduce the strength of association with a causal SNP in such cases []. All SNPs and haplotypes associated with SCS in our study explained only a small proportion of the total genetic variance. This is due to the low heritability and the complex nature of the SCS trait  which involves the effects of a large number of variants. The effects of potential additional loci were probably too small to pass the stringent genome-wide significant threshold  or the causal variants were too far away (low LD) from the SNPs that were genotyped  or the causal variants had a different allele frequency than the genotyped SNPs (incomplete LD). This study is the first GWAS for SCS in German Holstein cattle. The results provide further evidence for previously reported QTL for SCS on BTA5  6  18 and 19 in Holstein cattle  which were fine-mapped in our GWAS. In addition to known QTL  we identified QTL on BTA13 and the X-chromosome that have not been reported before. In the comparison of GWAS using SNPs versus haplotype  our results demonstrate that GWAS using haplotypes provides some information that was not obtained by SNP analyses alone. Thus  GWAS using SNP and haplotype information can contribute to increase the proportion of genetic variance explained by QTL. Although SNP chips with higher density and next-generation sequencing may provide new data in the near future  the results of our study suggest that the 50 k bovine BeadChip is a valuable source of information to discover mechanisms that contribute to high and low SCS or to different susceptibilities for mastitis.  autosome  chromosome X Centimorgan Daughter yield deviations Genome-wide association study Identity-by-state Linkage disequilibrium Minor allele frequency Mega base Multi-dimensional scaling Pairwise population concordance Quantitative trait loci Somatic cell count Somatic cell score Single nucleotide polymorphism Vereinigte Informationssysteme Tierhaltung Genomic inflation factor.

Candidate regions associated with recombination were identified in both breeds. Recombination analysis may improve the accuracy of haplotype phasing and genotype imputation from low- to high-density SNP panels. The meiotic exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes is known as recombination. Recombination events do not take place randomly throughout the genome  but tend to occur in recombination hotspots []  which are usually small regions in which recombination rate is significantly higher than in surrounding regions. Rates of recombination on different chromosomes are sex-specific  with rates in females being higher near centromeres and rates in males being higher near telomeres []. Methodologies for discovering recombination hotspots and descriptions of their properties have been reviewed from the perspectives of mammals [  ] and plants []. Elucidating the characteristics of recombination might help understand the creation and loss of haplotypes and explain genome-wide variation in linkage disequilibrium (LD). Recombination rates are related to distance from the centromere [  ]  and regional GC content [  ]. The location and activity of recombination hotspots is regulated both by  and  acting genes []. Trans-acting genes  such as  control hotspot activation in mice [] and humans [  ]  and allow a meiosis-specific protein  SPO11 to initiate recombination []. Moreover  []  [–] and other loci [] have been found to influence genome-wide recombination activity in cattle [] and humans [  ]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) associate genomic variants with a trait of interest to identify positional candidate loci [  ]. Haplotype-based association tests and imputation from low- to high-density genotyping panels can both improve the power of GWAS to detect QTL [] and most methods for haplotype phasing can also be used for genotype imputation. Furthermore  the estimation of haplotype phase can use LD information [] and/or pedigree structure []. Statistical models used to infer haplotype phase and impute missing genotypes include Hidden Markov models [  ]  rule-based approaches []  long-range phasing algorithms []  and other methods. The importance of haplotype phase estimation and genotype imputation is increasing as large-scale sequencing projects generate genome-wide genotype information. Effectiveness of genotype phasing and imputation are influenced by marker density  extent of LD  effective population size  marker minor allele frequency (MAF)  size of the training population  position on the chromosome  and the extent of pedigree relationships between training and imputed populations [–]. Kirk and Cardon [] pointed out that a small number of genotyping errors can significantly decrease the apparent haplotype frequency and the accuracy of haplotype reconstruction. Haplotype frequencies and counts are also affected by recombination. Although Sandor et al. [] have reported estimated heritabilities of recombination rate and the identification of recombination hotspots and quantitative trait loci (QTL) in dairy cattle  recombination rates have been less investigated in cattle than in mice  humans and other mammals. In our study  we quantified recombination rates and their impact on phasing accuracy in two purebred beef cattle populations i.e. Angus and Limousin. Our goals were to: (i) examine the impact of pedigree information  phasing method  and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) location errors on the inference of haplotypes  (ii) quantify the impact of recombination on haplotype phasing  (iii) locate recombination hot windows and QTL which influence genome-wide recombination numbers (GRN)  and (iv) evaluate the relationship between recombination rate and accuracy of genotype imputation in beef cattle. A total of 3570 Angus bulls born between 1955 and 2008  and 2275 Limousin cattle (1319 bulls and 955 daughters) born between 1974 and 2007 that were genotyped with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina  San Diego  CA) were used in this study. Genotypes were obtained using DNA samples extracted from semen or hair samples and did not require an approved animal use and care protocol. Genome-wide Mendelian consistency was tested on sire-offspring pairs  and those that failed or had genotype call rates (CR) below 95% were removed. After selection  2778 Angus and 1485 Limousin parent-verified sire-offspring pairs remained. The average sizes of the 604 Angus and 235 Limousin half-sib families were 4.6 (between 1 and 103) and 6.3 (between 1 and 135)  respectively. Individual SNPs with a CR less than 0.95  a MAF less than 0.01  a  value for a Hardy Weinberg equilibrium test less than 0.001  or a Mendelian inconsistency rate greater than 0.0024 (95% quantile) were removed. After quality control  40 990 SNPs across 29  (BTA) autosomes in Angus and 38 815 SNPs in Limousin remained  of which 34 788 were in common. Missing 50K genotypes (0.45% and 0.02% of all Angus and Limousin genotypes  respectively) were imputed using BEAGLE3.3 []. In order to evaluate the relationship between recombination rate and genotype imputation  a cross-validation study was conducted to quantify the imputation accuracy. Imputation from low- to high-density SNP panels was performed in Angus based on the use of only that subset of 7345 SNPs from the 50K panel that were on the GGP7K panel (GeneSeek  Lincoln  NE) for those animals used in the validation. Phasing of haplotypes was performed one chromosome at a time using either the unrelated option in BEAGLE 3.3 [] or DAGPHASE2.4 []. Phasing was first performed using SNP coordinates from the UMD3.1 assembly []  which is known to contain some errors. The USDA-AIPL linkage map [] that was constructed from linkage analysis based on the UMD3.1 assembly coordinates was used as an alternative. The comparison of phasing accuracies obtained from these two alternative marker orders was determined for BTA15 as a representative example. The hidden Markov model based on the Viterbi algorithm [] implemented in BEAGLE was used to reconstruct haplotypes and to impute from low- to high-density SNP panels. In order to increase haplotype phasing accuracy  BEAGLE was set to run 20 iterations of the phasing algorithm and to sample 20 haplotype pairs per individual per iteration. Before using DAGPHASE  the assembly coordinates for the markers were used to generate a genetic map assuming that 1 Mb equals 1 cM. Then  DAGPHASE was used to reconstruct haplotypes based on the output of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from BEAGLE with scale and shift parameters set at 2.0 and 0.1  respectively. The number of different haplotypes in every 1 Mb window was counted for each chromosome in the Angus population. Phasing errors can result in erroneous haplotypes that might occur at low frequency  so only haplotypes with a frequency greater than 5% (>5% quantile) in each window were included. Recombination events were identified as phase changes in the transmitted gametes by comparing the two reconstructed haplotypes inherited by each offspring with the two reconstructed haplotypes of their sire. Each recombination event was localized to a recombination interval defined by a pair of informative markers for which the phase was known. Haplotype mismatches were not common but were identified when the putative paternally-inherited haplotype of the offspring identified by BEAGLE or DAGPHASE was not identical to either of the haplotypes of the sire. Double crossover events that occurred in intervals less than 2 Mb  animals with more than three crossover events per chromosome  parent-offspring pairs with a haplotype mismatch rate greater than 0.05  crossover events occurring in 1 Mb windows for which the estimated recombination rate was significantly greater than 0.025 or which contained SNPs with a haplotype mismatch rate greater than 0.05 were ignored. Such unlikely crossover events were attributed to either genotyping or phasing errors. The GRN for each parent-offspring pair was calculated as the summation of observed crossover events across the 29 autosomes. On average  one crossover event occurs on a chromosome of size 1 Morgan (M) []. Accordingly  the average genome-wide recombination distance per Mb was calculated as the GRN divided by the total length of the 29 bovine autosomes. We found that GRN decreased with increasing family size and that haplotype phasing error rates were inflated in smaller families. As a result  only half-sib families with at least three offspring were retained in the following analysis. The observed probabilities of 0  1  2  3  >3 crossover events were separately calculated for every autosome. For a given number of crossovers  after removing unlikely crossover events described above  the number of parent-offspring pairs with that number of crossovers was divided by the total number of parent-offspring pairs in the analyzed population  to obtain the observed crossover probability for that chromosome. This produced five observed crossover probabilities for every autosome. The five expected crossover probabilities were calculated for each autosome based on its length in base pairs assuming that crossover events follow a binomial distribution []. Ott [] pointed out that  = 4 would be a reasonable maximum crossover number for chromosomes for which the maximum recombination rate is less than 0.5. The equation to calculate the expected crossover probabilities was: where  is the expected crossover probability   is the maximum number of crossover events per chromosome   is the observed number of crossover events (0/1/2/3/4) per chromosome  and  is the length (M) of the corresponding chromosome  assuming 100 Mb is 1 M. The expected genetic length of each chromosome (M) was computed as  where  is the number of crossover events (1/2/3/4) on the corresponding chromosome  and  is the expected probability of crossover . The expected chromosomal recombination distance per Mb was calculated as the expected genetic length (cM) divided by the physical length (Mb) of the corresponding chromosome. Recombination rate was estimated for every non-overlapping 1 Mb window to identify recombination hot windows. Some recombination intervals for a particular recombination event could not be localized to positions strictly within a single 1 Mb window. In those cases  a part of the recombination event was considered to have occurred in each window that spanned the recombination interval. The recombination rate in a defined 1 Mb window was computed as: where  is the observed window recombination rate   is the total number of recombination events observed on the corresponding chromosome   is the overlap (in Mb) between the 1 Mb window and recombination interval     is the length (in Mb) of the recombination interval  and  is the total number of sire-offspring pairs. Genome-wide recombination numbers of sires were treated as phenotypes  thus sires with multiple offspring had repeated records. Narrow sense heritabilities () of GRN were estimated separately for each breed using a repeatability model in ASReml3.0 []. The model equation was where  is the vector of repeated genome-wide recombination phenotypes for sires   represents the unknown mean treated as a fixed effect   is the vector of random animal effects with  where  is the pedigree relationship matrix among sires   is the vector of permanent environmental effects   and  are design matrices  and  is the vector of residual effects. A marker-based heritability was estimated using a BayesC model [  ] as implemented in GENSEL4.0 software []. BayesC assumes that all SNP effects have a common variance  and the prior for that variance has a scaled inverse Chi-square distribution. The model equation was: where  is the average GRN for sire    is the population mean   is the number of SNP   is genotype code (0/1/2) for SNP  in sire    is the random effect for SNP  with   and  is a weighted residual effect. Parameter   was set to 0 in this study. BayesC with   equal to 0 is equivalent to GBLUP (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor)  except that the variance components are treated as unknown with scaled inverse chi-squared priors. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with 41 000 iterations in which the first 1000 samples were discarded for burn-in  was used to make inferences about variance components and heritability. The weighting factor () [] for residual variance was calculated as: where  is the narrow sense heritability estimated from pedigree   is the proportion of genetic variation that could not be explained by markers   is the repeatability  and  is the number of observations for the sire. In this study   was assumed to be equal to 0.40 for both Angus and Limousin  according to []. Mapping QTL that influence sire mean GRN was undertaken using the BayesB method [] with weighting factors defined as for the above model implemented in GENSEL4.0 software []. BayesB assumes that each SNP effect is drawn from a distribution with a locus-specific variance with scaled inverse Chi-square prior distributions  and that a fraction (1<U+2009>-<U+2009>) of the markers have non-zero effects. Parameter   was assumed to be equal to 0.995  which results in about 0.5% of the SNPs fit in the model at each iteration. Based on simulations  Sun et al. [] showed that the BayesB method could precisely map QTL. The genome was divided into non-overlapping 1 Mb windows and the posterior distribution of the percentage of genetic variance attributed to each window was constructed from the MCMC samples (e.g. []). The expected percentage of genetic variance explained by each of the ~2600 1 Mb windows is about 0.04% under a polygenic model. Windows that explained at least 0.2% (5 fold the expected percentage) of the genetic variance []  and extended regions on either side of these windows (±2 Mb) were considered to represent QTL. Unpublished simulations using beef cattle genotypes showed that the location of a QTL can be up to 2 Mb up- or downstream of a 1 Mb window that explains a high proportion of genetic variance. The window posterior probabilities of association (WPPA) of candidate windows (i.e. with at least 0.2% genetic variance) was at least 1.5-fold greater than the average WPPA of 1 Mb windows across the genome. WPPA is the posterior probability that a window harbors a QTL  which is the proportion of samples for which at least one SNP in the window was included with a non-zero effect. The SNP that had the highest posterior probability of inclusion (PPI) and explained the largest proportion of genetic variance in each central candidate window was identified as a candidate SNP. The PPI is estimated as the percentage of MCMC samples in which a given SNP had a non-zero effect. The proportion of genetic variance explained by each candidate SNP was assessed as the difference in genetic variance explained by the window when it included or excluded the candidate SNP. Significance of the effect of the candidate SNP was evaluated in an animal model with ASReml3.0 []  by fitting the SNP genotype as a fixed class effect. Bonferroni adjustment was applied to  values from that single SNP analysis by accounting for the number of effective chromosome segments across the genome ()  which was calculated as []: where   is the effective population size   is the average length of a chromosome in Morgan (~1 M)  and  is the number of chromosomes ( = 30). In this study     was assumed to be equal to 545 for Angus and 91 for Limousin  based on []. Using the human-bovine comparative map implemented in VCMap3.0 []  orthologous human genome regions corresponding to candidate bovine windows were located. Positional candidate genes within these orthologous human regions were identified using the NCBI Human Genome Overview Build 36.3 (). A list of previously published human candidate genes related to meiosis  recombination  or the cell cycle were extracted from OMIM []. Using VCMap3.0 [] or Ensembl ()  locations of the bovine orthologs of these genes were mapped to the bovine genome. These locations were used to test for concordance between locations of candidate genes and identified QTL. Cross-validation was used to determine the accuracy of BEAGLE imputation from 7K to 50K SNPs in the Angus dataset. The genotyped bulls were clustered into five groups using a K-means clustering method based on additive genetic relationships between animals []. The aim of this method was to increase within-group and decrease between-group relationships. Four testing groups were used for phasing haplotypes from the 50K SNP genotypes  while imputation from the 7K SNP panel was performed in the fifth validation group. This was repeated with each of the five groups being treated once as the validation group. The 7K SNP genotypes were extracted from the 50K SNP genotypes for the validation group. Accuracies of imputation were quantified per marker and summarized per chromosome and per animal. The imputation accuracy was evaluated as the fraction of the imputed genotypes that were identical to the original genotypes on the 50K SNP panel in the validation group. Imputation accuracy was also quantified separately in every 1 Mb window along each chromosome. Levels of LD between every two adjacent SNPs were evaluated as   the squared simple correlation between genotypes of two adjacent SNPs using R software []. These measures of LD between adjacent markers were averaged to provide a single measure of LD for each 1 Mb window. Figure  shows that the probability of zero crossover events per chromosome increased with decreasing chromosome length  while the probability of two or more crossover events decreased. The observed proportion of individuals with more than three crossover events was higher than the expected value for all autosomes. In general  DAGPHASE  which uses linkage information from parent-offspring relationships  produced a distribution of crossovers for which the observed frequencies were closer to the expected values  indicating that it was superior for phasing compared to BEAGLE with pedigree ignored.  Solid line represents expected probability calculated by Karlin’s map function  dashed line represents observed probability using DAGPHASE  and dotted line represents observed probability using BEAGLE. The distributions of observed numbers of crossovers on BTA15 were close to the expected values for both the Angus and Limousin breeds  except for the proportion of more than two crossover events per meiosis [see Additional file : Figure S1A]  which exceeded the expected values. Possible reasons for the phasing errors that likely caused the discrepancies between expected and observed crossover probabilities are small half-sib family sizes (median size was 2 in both populations)  limited numbers of parent-offspring pairs  and errors in some mapped SNP locations. Both the Angus (41.4%) and Limousin (36.6%) breeds had a large proportion of half-sib families represented by only one son. Compared to Angus  the Limousin breed had a higher probability of more than two crossover events per meiosis  probably because of its smaller sample size which reduces the accuracy of haplotype phasing. The higher accuracy in Angus compared to Limousin was also observed for autosomes other than BTA15 [see Additional file : Figure S1B]. It has been found that the larger the phasing sample size  the greater the haplotype phasing accuracy []. Figure  compares observed probabilities of crossover events on Angus BTA15 using UMD3.1 versus USDA-AIPL locus coordinates. A total of 1304 SNPs were assigned based on the UMD3.1 and 1262 SNPs based on the USDA-AIPL  with 1234 common SNPs. The estimated probability of more than two crossover events using USDA-AIPL coordinates was smaller than that using the UMD3.1 coordinates  which suggests that a better genome assembly can improve the accuracy of phasing.                                                      The average number of unique haplotypes per 1 Mb windows (±SD) was 37.1±13.8 in Angus. Despite the presence of outliers  there was a linear relationship between number of haplotypes and recombination rate [see Additional file : Figure S2]. The number of haplotypes declined with decreasing window-wide recombination rates  because new haplotypes are formed by recombination. Recombination hot or cold windows were defined as windows with recombination rates greater than 0.02 (=1.5 standard deviations from the mean) and lower than 0.004  respectively. These definitions differ from those previously used for dairy cattle (60 Kb window) [] and humans (<2 Kb window) []  because of the different lengths of the defined window. The average number of SNPs (±SD) was 17.8 (±4.5) in hot windows and 13.7 (±5.8) in cold windows. The average numbers of haplotypes (±SD) in hot and cold windows were adjusted for the corresponding average number of SNPs. The number of haplotypes was equal to 50.9±13.3 (ranging from 23.4 to 99.5) in hot windows  and 24.5±6.8 (ranging from 7.4 to 47.2) in cold windows  respectively (Figure ). The correlation coefficient between the average number of unique haplotypes within each window and the recombination rate in that 1 Mb window was 0.64. All autosomes showed significant disparities in numbers of haplotypes per 1 Mb windows between hot and cold windows.  Number of haplotypes in hot (red) and cold windows (blue)  which were defined as windows with a recombination rate = 0.02 (=1.5 standard deviations from the mean) and windows with recombination rate = 0.004  respectively; *indicates a significant difference with  < 0.05  and **indicates a significant difference with  < 0.01 for a paired t-test. A total of 76 186 and 32 052 informative crossover events were identified in Angus and Limousin gametes  respectively. The physical length of the 29 bovine autosomes is 2511.4 Mb (UMD3.1)  which corresponds to an average genetic length of 3097 cM (Table ). On average  the genome-wide recombination distance per Mb across the 29 autosomes was 1.23 cM/Mb. BTA20 had the lowest  and BTA23 the highest cM per Mb ratio. Figure  shows the expected and estimated recombination distances per Mb for the 29 bovine autosomes. Recombination distances per Mb differed between chromosomes; short chromosomes had greater genetic distances per Mb than long chromosomes []. Chromosomal recombination distances per Mb estimated in the two breeds were similar  with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 between Angus and Limousin. However  the recombination distances per Mb were lower than the expected values for most autosomes  which suggests that conservative filtering of unlikely crossover events leads to an underestimation of the chromosome-specific recombination distance per Mb.                                                      Taking BTA15 as an example  the correlation between window recombination rates in the Angus and Limousin breeds was equal to 0.56  and recombination rates in a 1 Mb window varied from 0 to over 0.02 [see Additional file : Figure S3A]. A large number of recombination hot and cold windows were detected across the chromosome. Since bovine chromosomes are acrocentric  with the centromere at the proximal chromosome end  recombination rates were relatively low in that region. Reduced information at the proximal end of the chromosome could also lead to a low accuracy of detected recombination events. As shown in Additional file : Figure S3B  the location of hot and cold windows for recombination was consistent for the two breeds across the genome  although  in some instances  window shifts existed  such that a higher recombination rate for Angus corresponds to a lower recombination rate for Limousin and vice versa. Across the genome  the correlation of 1 Mb window recombination rate between the Angus and Limousin breeds was high  with a correlation coefficient of 0.49. The average window recombination rates per 1 Mb (±SD) were equal to 0.0099±0.0052 and 0.0088±0.0053 in Angus and Limousin breeds  respectively. A total of 427 and 348 hot windows were identified in Angus and Limousin  respectively  of which 166 were in common. Hot windows were found in both the proximal and distal chromosome ends  while cold windows clustered around the middle of each chromosome and the proximal chromosome end. The average number of recombination events per chromosome differed between autosomes. Longer autosomes tended to have more recombination events. The average GRN (±SD) was equal to 27.4±5.0 in Angus and 26.9±4.8 in Limousin. These values were close to the paternal recombination numbers of 27.6 reported by Chowdhury et al. [] and 27.0 reported by Kong et al. [] in humans. GRN did not differ significantly between the breeds [see Additional file : Figure S4]. Estimates of GRN slightly decreased with increasing family size (with a correlation coefficient near -0.1)  as did the observed variation of GRN across families  which is probably due to an increase of phasing errors in small families [see Additional file : Figure S5]. The pedigree-based estimates of heritability of GRN (±SE) by ASReml3.0 [] were equal to 0.26±0.030 and 0.23±0.042 and estimates of repeatability were equal to 0.33±0.027 and 0.30±0.038 in Angus and Limousin  respectively. However  estimates of marker-based heritability of GRN (±SE) by BayesC in GENSEL4.0 software [] were slightly lower  i.e. 0.17±0.039 in Angus and 0.14±0.031 in Limousin. Results reported in Saatchi et al. [] demonstrate that the marker-based heritability of routinely recorded traits (e.g. calving ease) of American Angus beef cattle was sometimes lower than the value of the pedigree-based heritability. This suggests that markers only captured a proportion of the genetic variance estimated from pedigree. Manhattan plots of the proportion of genetic variance explained by each 1 Mb window across the genome for GRN in Angus and Limousin are in Figure . The number of windows explaining at least 0.2% of the additive genetic variance was 35 in Angus and 22 in Limousin. The cumulative variance explained by those windows was equal to 17.8% in Angus and 8.2% in Limousin. Windows that exceeded 0.2% additive genetic variance and had 1.5-fold average WPPA were considered to be significant for further study [see Additional file : Table S1]. Different candidate SNPs were identified within each window in Angus and Limousin. The highest proportion of genetic variance (3.48%) was explained by a 1 Mb window located at 67 Mb on BTA21 for Angus  which had a high WPPA (0.45) and a significant SNP accounting for 3.42% of the genetic variance. The most significant region in the Limousin breed was a 1 Mb window located at 89 Mb on BTA4 and explained 2.55% of genetic variance. Positional candidate genes [see Additional file : Table S1]  that have been reported to be involved in meiotic recombination  DNA replication  DNA repair or the cell cycle [] were detected within or near (±2 Mb) significant windows but only in Angus;     and  are involved in both meiotic recombination and repair of damaged DNA  while  is only involved in DNA repair  whereas  and  regulate cellular processes  such as differentiation and cell cycle checkpoint control.                                                      In Angus  the average imputation accuracy across animals was equal to 0.981  ranging from 0.81 to 1.00  and the average imputation accuracy per chromosome was also equal to 0.981  ranging from 0.97 to 0.99 [see Additional file : Table S2]. BTA21 had the lowest imputation accuracy (0.973)  while BTA4 had the highest accuracy (0.985). The average marker density (i.e. average distance in kb between two adjacent markers) was equal to 61.0 kb  ranging from 54.6 to 70.9 kb  and the average  between adjacent markers within each 1 Mb window was 0.237  ranging from 0.192 to 0.269. Imputation accuracy increased slightly as marker density and  increased. In Additional file : Figure S6A  Angus bulls were grouped according to the number of observed crossover events per chromosome. The average imputation accuracy (±SD) in groups with no  one  two and more than two crossover events was equal to 0.986±0.00835  0.983±0.0191  0.981±0.0203  and 0.980±0.0215  respectively. Imputation accuracy decreased only slightly as the number of crossover events increased. Taking BTA1 as an example  imputation accuracy was highest in individuals with no crossover events  and lowest in individuals with more than two observed crossover events due to a higher risk of phasing errors. Window-wide imputation accuracy decreased with increasing recombination rate [see Additional file : Figure S6B]. The correlation coefficient between window-wide imputation accuracy and recombination rate was equal to -0.49 and the regression coefficient of imputation accuracy on recombination rate was equal to -1.0. Average imputation accuracies of 0.975 (ranging from 0.913 to 0.995)  and 0.990 (ranging from 0.927 to 1.00) were found in hot and cold windows  respectively. Figure  shows that imputation accuracy was lower in recombination hot windows than in cold windows.  Hot (red) and cold windows (blue)  which were defined as windows with a recombination rate = 0.02 (=1.5 standard deviations from the mean) and windows with recombination rate = 0.004  respectively; *indicates a significant difference with  < 0.05  and **indicates a significant difference with  < 0.01 for a paired t-test. Accuracy of phasing haplotypes was quantified in relation to recombination events. DAGPHASE []  which uses linkage information from parent-offspring relationships was superior to using BEAGLE [] with relationships for phasing haplotypes ignored. DAGPHASE extracts both population LD and linkage information for phasing  rather than relying on LD alone []. To infer haplotypes of offspring with both genotyped parents  parental haplotypes and linkage information were used. For offspring with one genotyped parent  linkage and LD information were jointly used by DAGPHASE  while only LD information extracted from the BEAGLE-produced DAG file was used to determine haplotypes of individuals with both parents non-genotyped. DAGPHASE uses a diploid Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Viterbi algorithm with linkage and LD information to improve phase reconstruction []. BEAGLE also assumes a HMM but uses EM-style updating that locally clusters haplotypes []. BEAGLE with the options applied in this study phased related individuals as if they were unrelated. Ignoring additive genetic relationships can lead to inconsistent haplotypes between related individuals. Thus  the accuracy of estimating haplotypes can be improved by using linkage information from relatives []. However  DAGPHASE does not reconstruct haplotypes of parents  while LINKPHASE  another algorithm from the Phasebook software package []  could use offspring information to modify phase reconstruction in parents. Further investigation is needed to verify whether the combination of both DAGPHASE and LINKPHASE may lead to more robust results in large families. Haldane’s (e.g.  [  ]) and Kosambi’s map functions (e.g.  [  ]) are often used to calculate recombination probabilities and to estimate the genetic length of each chromosome. In contrast  in this study crossover events were assumed to follow a binomial distribution following Karlin []. Haldane [] assumed a Poisson distribution and that crossovers in adjacent intervals occur independently. Kosambi’s function [] makes strong assumptions about interference between nearby crossovers. Kosambi’s function appears to produce more realistic map distances than Haldane’s function []. Both these map functions postulate that theoretically an unlimited number of crossovers can occur per chromosome. However  Karlin [] assumed that  at most  N crossovers could be independently distributed in an interval  with the number of events following a binomial distribution. In Additional file : Figure S7  the autosomes were sorted by their genetic length (M)  and chromosomal recombination rates produced using Karlin’s formula (with  = 4) were intermediate to those produced by the Kosambi and Haldane functions. Lian et al. [] reported that crossover interference increases with decreasing chromosome length. Since strong positive crossover interference exists  quantifying the level of crossover interference on each chromosome could improve the estimation of recombination rates. For example  Broman and Weber [] found that in human family data a gamma distribution better characterized chromosome-specific crossover interference than did four other distributions. Many instances of double crossover events over a short distance (i.e. within 1 Mb) and individuals with excessive numbers of recombination events were observed. Genotyping  phasing  and map errors can cause overestimation of recombination rates and lead to biases in determining haplotypes from genotypic data. The data were carefully filtered for the presence of apparent double crossover events. Two crossover events separated by a small distance (<2 Mb) were attributed to phasing errors and were ignored from calculation of crossover probabilities and GRN. Other phasing or genotyping errors  such as when a sire had a recombination rate significantly higher than 0.025 in a certain window  or when all sons in a family showed two or more crossover events at the same location  were also ignored in subsequent analyses. More than two crossover events located nearby suggests a marker order error. Rather than removing the unlikely recombination event as we did here  a reordering of the markers should be considered for further study []. The existence of gene conversion across the chromosome is another possible cause of apparent double crossover events. During meiosis  heteroduplexes are generated in the form of either crossover or non-crossover events. Gene conversion is the non-crossover form of a heteroduplex  which is the consequence of mismatched base pairs in a heteroduplex region corrected by DNA repair mechanisms []. Heteroduplex regions can extend for several kb and can contain some mismatched base pairs []. The resolution of the SNP panel used in this study did not allow heteroduplex regions to be confirmed. Some of the double crossovers over a short distance (i.e. within 1 Mb)  which we ignored may represent gene conversion. There is evidence that crossover hot spots are hot spots for gene conversion in mice [] and humans []. Each recombination event was identified within a recombination interval  which is the segment of homozygous non-informative loci that could have belonged to the haplotype of either parent. Recombination that occurs within a long homozygous segment cannot be localized. The average length of recombination intervals was 1.38 Mb (~23 SNPs) for Angus and for Limousin. The average number of SNPs in homozygous segments in sires was equal to 3.82±12.34 (~0.23±0.74 Mb) in Angus and 3.42±6.73 (~0.20±0.40 Mb) in Limousin. Long homozygous segments were defined as those containing more than 20 SNPs. On average  an autosome contained 3.4±1.3 such long segments in Angus and 1.5±0.7 in Limousin. Therefore  the impact of long homozygous segments on the identification of recombination events is not expected to be a factor in this study. The average chromosome-specific cM per Mb ratio increased with chromosome size  as in previous studies [  ]. Kong et al. [] reported an average genomic recombination distance per Mb of 1.19 cM/Mb in humans. Our estimate of 1.23 cM/Mb was similar to the 1.25 cM/Mb value reported by Arias et al. [] based on the Btau4.0 assembly [] with a total physical length of 2468.3 Mb for the 29 autosomes  rather than 2511.4 Mb for the UMD3.1 assembly. Inconsistencies in chromosome lengths and marker order led to different chromosome genetic lengths. The pedigree-based heritabilities in Angus (0.26) and Limousin (0.23) were slightly higher than that (0.22) reported by Sandor et al. [] in a sample of 13 975 Dutch Holstein-Friesian bulls within three-generation paternal half-sib families. A repeatability model with GRN records for sires was considered in our study. Sandor et al. [] fitted genome-wide recombination rates corrected for family size in an animal model. Differences in generation structures  sample sizes  and estimation models could lead to disparities in heritability estimates. Kong et al. [] estimated a heritability of recombination rate of 0.30 in humans  which indicates that a large genetic component underlies variation in recombination rate and that the heritability of GRN differs between breeds and species. GWAS have been widely applied in humans [] and livestock []. Because inferences from Bayesian methods are based on the joint posterior distribution  they are useful for GWAS []. Regardless of the method used  detection of large-effect QTL is easier than detection of small-effect QTL. Unpublished simulations using beef cattle genotypes shows that causal mutations may lie in regions upstream or downstream of the window that has the strongest association. Although flanking regions near the most strongly associated windows (±2 Mb) were investigated  further analyses are needed to confirm our results. Significant windows associated with genome-wide recombination were located on different chromosomes in the Angus and Limousin breeds. However  Saatchi et al. [] identified QTL of growth and production traits with consistent effects across multiple breeds. Further investigation is needed to verify whether the location and impact of recombination QTL differs between breeds. Two regions  one on BTA6 for the Angus breed and one on BTA4 for the Limousin breed  were found to explain a significant proportion of the genetic variance (>0.2%)  but SNPs with the highest PPI within these two windows were not significant. However  the previous validated genes [–] and []  were 4 Mb downstream from the window detected on BTA6 in Angus and 4 Mb upstream from the window detected on BTA4 in Limousin  respectively. Differences in mapping results for genome-wide recombination number (or rate) in plants []  humans []  dairy cattle []  and beef cattle suggest that genome-wide recombination could be regulated in a species-specific manner  that the effects of QTL differ between species  and that the genetic determinism of regulation of recombination is probably polygenic. Imputation accuracy was higher in the regions with denser markers and higher LD levels (). With denser markers  better imputation accuracy is expected [  ] and stronger LD between SNPs improves the reconstruction of haplotypes []. Higher recombination rates reduced the accuracy of haplotype phasing and genotype imputation and conversely  imputation accuracy was lowest in recombination hot windows. The use of haplotypes is advantageous for genomic prediction and GWAS [  ] provide accurately phased haplotypes. Marker location errors within a genome assembly can be detected by recombination analysis. An improved genome assembly leading to a more accurate reflection of true meiotic recombination could be produced by reordering the markers. Similarly  the accuracy of haplotype phasing and imputation from low- to high-density SNP panels could be improved by using recombination results. How to implement recombination information in haplotype phasing and imputation remains a challenging question. This study investigated the relationships between recombination  haplotype phasing  and imputation in two breeds of cattle. The accuracy of phasing using DAGPHASE was superior to BEAGLE  which did not use linkage information from parent-offspring. The major reasons for the detection of unlikely recombination events are gene conversion and phasing errors. Gene conversion is caused by mismatch correction in heteroduplex regions. Phasing errors can be influenced by limited sample size  small half-sib families  low marker density  and marker location errors in the genome assembly. The QTL mapping results for genome-wide recombination number in Angus differed from those in Limousin  which suggests that recombination is under polygenic control. High levels of recombination decrease the accuracy of phasing and genotype imputation. These results suggest that recombination analysis can detect location errors within the genome assembly  and could be used to improve the inference of haplotype phase and the accuracy of genotype imputation from low- to high-density panels.

This  in turn could reduce a major welfare problem. Feather pecking (FP) is a major welfare issue in commercial laying hens. Depending on the severity of the pecking it can result in feather loss or damage  or skin or muscle injuries []. If the latter results in death  FP is referred to as cannibalism []. When hens are not beak trimmed  the incidence of cannibalistic FP is higher in non-cage systems than in cage systems []. Since the beginning of 2012  cage systems have been prohibited in the European Union and the problem of FP is expected to increase []. Therefore  it is necessary to find a solution to prevent or reduce FP  especially when beak treatments are banned or will be banned in the future. FP is a multi-factorial problem caused by both animal-related and environmental factors []. A common procedure to limit the consequences of FP is beak trimming. There are plans to ban beak trimming since this procedure has welfare implications  such as chronic pain []. In some European countries  beak trimming is already prohibited or regulated []. Other management solutions could be feed-related []. Furthermore  it has been shown that FP behaviour can be influenced by light intensity []  provision of floor litter []  group size []  and stocking density []. So far  there are no management solutions that can completely prevent FP. An additional measure to reduce FP is genetic selection [  ]. FP is a social interaction phenomenon  that involves both the victim that receives the pecking and its group mates that inflict the pecking [–]. When traits are affected by social interactions among group members  the genetic effects that underlie individual phenotypes can be partitioned into a direct genetic effect (DGE) of the genotype of the individual itself  and the indirect genetic effects (IGE) of the genotypes of its group mates [–]. IGE can contribute to the heritable variation in a trait. For example  in laying hens showing cannibalistic behaviour  IGE contribute 33% to 87% of the total heritable variation in survival time [  ]. Genetic selection for survival time  using a selection method that takes IGE into account  could reduce FP behaviour. Unfortunately  survival time is only known at the end of the laying period. Therefore  it is necessary to define a trait that can be collected early in the laying period and that is correlated with FP behaviour. To measure FP  behavioural observations are needed. However  several authors have used a feather condition score (FCS) to assess plumage condition as an alternative to behavioural observations [    ]. Damage to the plumage is strongly related to the incidence of severe FP behaviour []. One disadvantage of using FCS instead of direct observations of pecking behaviour is that one can only detect the victim of FP and not the animal that actually inflicts the pecking. However  using methods that take IGE into account allows us to estimate both the breeding value for pecker-effect (the IGE) and for the victim-effect (the DGE) in group-housed laying hens [  ]. Estimating a breeding value for the pecker-effect is less accurate than using behavioural observations but  in animal breeding  it is not feasible to record a behavioural observation for each individual but it is possible to estimate DGE and IGE for each individual. So far  most studies that focus on the plumage condition of laying hens have ignored the effect of group mates. However  it is expected that IGE contribute significantly to the heritable variation of plumage condition in laying hens  especially in the case of damaging behaviour such as FP. To improve plumage condition in laying hens  knowledge of the genetic parameters for both direct and indirect effects is required. In the present study  genetic parameters of plumage condition in laying hens were estimated using a classical animal model and a model that combined both direct and indirect genetic effects. Plumage condition was measured on four body regions; neck  back  rump and belly using the FCS. In addition  genetic correlations between the different body regions were estimated. For this study  data from the experiment that is described in Ellen et al. [] were used except that FCS were used instead of survival time data. The main characteristics are summarized below. Further details are in Ellen et al. []. Data were collected under control of Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.  the layer breeding division of Hendrix Genetics. Hendrix Genetics complies with the Dutch law on animal wellbeing. Data on two purebred White Leghorn layer lines were provided by the Institut de Sélection Animale B.V.. The two lines were coded W1 and WB. Data from line WF were not used in this study because fewer observations were available for this line and its mortality due to cannibalism was low (in comparison with the other two lines)  which would lead to inaccurate genetic parameters for direct and indirect effects of survival time []. Within a line  sires and dams were mated at random. Matings were done in two batches with a six-month time period between the two batches. Sires used for both batches were largely the same (89% for line W1 and 94% for line WB)  while dams were all different. For each batch  sires (36 of line W1 and 35 of line WB) were mated to approximately eight dams each  and each dam contributed on average 12.3 female offspring. For both lines  observations from a single generation were used. Chickens of both lines were hatched in two batches and each batch consisted of four consecutive age groups that differed by a two-week period each. All 12 192 chickens had intact beaks. When the hens were on average 17 weeks old  they were transported to two laying houses with traditional four-bird-battery cages. The two batches were each placed in separate laying houses  termed 1 and 2. In both laying houses  the 17-week-old hens were randomly allocated to laying cages  with four birds of the same line and age in a cage. The individuals making up a cage were combined at random  without taking size of the hens into account. In both laying houses  cages were grouped into eight double rows. Each row consisted of three levels (top  close to the light; middle; and bottom). A feeding trough was in front of the cages and each pair of back-to-back cages shared two drinking nipples. A standard commercial layer diet and water were provided . In both laying houses  the hens started with a light period of 9 hours/day. Every week the light period was increased by 1 hour until 16 hours/day  when the hens were on average 26 weeks of age. Plumage condition was measured at 40 weeks of age on all hens alive. It was measured at eight time points  each separated by a two-week period  starting with the oldest hens  so that all birds were measured at the same age. To quantify plumage condition  the feather condition score (FCS) described in Bilcik and Keeling [] was used  as modified by Uitdehaag et al. []. The body of the hen was divided into four regions: neck  back  rump  and belly. These body regions were chosen because they are expected to be the regions to receive the largest number of pecks and plumage condition in those regions is less affected by abrasion []. Each body region was inspected and given a score from 0 (intact feathers) to 5 (completely denuded area). For further analysis  observations with a score 0 or 1 were combined into the score 1 class. FCS were recorded by four persons. Before performing the FCS  a single set of 153 birds were scored by the four persons to estimate the correlation between scores of different persons (between-observer correlation). The between-observer correlation ranged from 0.84 to 0.94 for neck  back  and rump but from 0.66 to 0.83 for belly (ED Ellen  unpublished data). All hens were observed daily. Dead hens were removed  and wing band number  cage number  and cause of death were recorded. Cause of death was determined subjectively without dissection. Thus for all hens in the dataset  their status alive (0) or dead (1) was known at the time of feather scoring. A total of 12 192 hens were present in the dataset composed of 5920 hens of line W1 and 6272 hens of line WB. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of laying  FCS were unavailable for 9.4% of the W1 hens and for 18.9% of the WB hens  which resulted in 5363 FCS records for line W1 and 5089 for line WB. A preliminary data analysis was performed using the SAS statistical program []. The GLM procedure was used to identify significant fixed effects to be included in the model for subsequent analysis. Analysis of FCS was done for each line and body region separately. The four body regions were summed into a total FCS  which was also analysed. The most significant fixed effects identified were the interaction between laying house-row-level and the person carrying out the scoring. Age and batch were fully confounded with laying house and row  and therefore not included in the model. A linear animal model was used in ASReml to estimate genetic parameters for FCS []. First  genetic parameters were estimated by using a classical animal model  where  is a vector of observed FCS;  is a vector of fixed effects  with incidence matrix  linking observations to the fixed effects;  is a vector of the breeding values  with incidence matrix  linking the observations on individuals to their breeding value;  is a vector of independent random cage effects  with incidence matrix  linking the observations to the random cage effect; and  is a vector of random residuals. The variance structure of the model terms are:     and . Matrix  is the matrix of additive genetic relationships between individuals based on five generations of pedigree   the genetic variance   an identity matrix   the cage variance  and  the residual variance. To avoid pedigree errors  hens with an unknown or double identification were coded as having an unknown pedigree (<U+2009>=<U+2009>63). The observations on these hens were included in the analysis to better estimate fixed effects. Second  genetic parameters were estimated for both the direct and indirect genetic effects using a direct–indirect effects model [  ]  where  is a vector of direct breeding values  with incidence matrix  linking observations on individuals to their direct breeding value   is a vector of indirect breeding values  with incidence matrix  linking observations on individuals to the indirect breeding values of their group mates (the other three individuals in the same cage; see []). The covariance structure of the genetic terms is   where  is the Kronecker product of matrices  and   where  is the direct genetic variance   is the indirect genetic variance  and  is the direct–indirect genetic covariance. The classical animal model (Equation ) and the direct–indirect effects model (Equation ) were statistically compared using a log-likelihood ratio test. The classical animal model was compared with a model without random effects (null model) and a model with only a random cage effect to test additive genetic variance. The direct–indirect effects model was compared with the classical animal model to test the indirect genetic (co)variance. In the classical animal model  the heritability is the ratio of heritable variance () and phenotypic variance (): In the direct–indirect effects model  the total heritable variance () available for response to selection is   where  is the number of individuals in a group []. Phenotypic variance is . The term (<U+2009>-<U+2009>1) in both expressions refers to the  <U+2009>-<U+2009>1 group mates with which the individual interacts. For socially affected traits  the ratio of total heritable variance and phenotypic variance () is: A comparison of  and  reflects the impact of IGE on heritable variation. Estimates of genetic parameters for single traits such as FCS can be biased when the data represent a selected subset of the population []. In lines W1 and WB  the percentage of animals that died before FCS was recorded was 9.4% and 18.9%  respectively. These dead animals can bias the estimated genetic parameters  since they are expected to have a higher FCS (more damage). Such selection bias can be reduced by using multiple-trait analysis []. For this reason  a bivariate analysis (Equation 5)  including both FCS and mortality at 40 weeks of age (0/1) was applied to both the classical animal model and the direct–indirect effects model. In the bivariate analysis  the model for mortality at 40 weeks of age (0/1) included only a DGE  since models that included both DGE and IGE failed to converge. Genetic correlations between the different body regions were estimated using a classical animal and the direct–indirect effects models. To estimate genetic correlations using the direct–indirect effects model  the bivariate model of Peeters et al. [] was used  where subscripts 1 and 2 denote FCS on two different body regions  e.g. neck and back. All other terms are the same as for Equation . The corresponding covariance structure of the genetic terms is with Thus there are four genetic variances and six genetic covariances;  and  are the direct and indirect genetic covariances between two body regions   and  are the genetic covariances between direct and indirect effects for one of the body regions  and  and  are the genetic covariances between the direct effect of one body region and the indirect effect of another body region. For all body regions and lines  genetic correlations were estimated between the DGE ()  the IGE ()  and the TBV (total breeding value) (). Correlation  depends on the total heritable variance within body regions ( and ) and the total genetic covariance between body regions ()  and is given by []. In the bivariate analyses  the random cage effect and residual were also allowed to be correlated between body regions. Average plumage condition differed between body regions (Figure ) and between the two lines (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Overall  line WB yielded the highest average FCS (worst plumage condition)  ranging from 1.6 (belly) to 2.3 (neck). Average FCS by region for line W1 ranged from 1.1 (rump) to 1.4 (neck). This is in line with results of Ellen et al. []  who found that average survival was lowest in line WB. Overall  the plumage condition was worst for the neck region and best for the back region. This is in contradiction with results of Bilcik and Keeling [] who used the same scoring method  but  in their study  hens were kept in groups of 15 birds. They found that plumage condition for the hybrid layer line Hisex white was worst for the belly region  and best for the neck and back regions. In addition  they showed that  although belly had the worst plumage condition  most pecks were targeted at the rump and back. These discrepancies with our results might be due to differences in line  age  and housing conditions such as density  size of groups  and light intensity. One major difference between the studies is that Bilcik and Keeling birds were housed in floor pens  while in the present study birds were housed in conventional cages. In conventional cages  much higher levels of abrasion of neck feathers are observed  due to contact with the cage door while feeding. The abrasion of neck feathers could stimulate the feather pecking behaviour of group mates  which can result in higher levels of neck damage.                                                      The FCS was significantly different between the two laying houses  except for belly (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.055). In laying house 2  back and rump had the lowest FCS  whereas in laying house 1 neck had the lowest FCS. Line WB had the worst plumage condition in both laying houses. Furthermore  significant differences in FCS between the three levels of each row and between the corridors were found (Table )  except for the effect of level on rump  belly  and total FCS (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). Overall  the lowest FCS (best plumage condition) were recorded on birds located on the bottom level  whereas the highest FCS were recorded on birds on the top and middle levels. Upper levels had higher light intensities  which stimulate FP behaviour and thus result in higher FCS (worst plumage condition) [  ]. Overall  the highest FCS were observed for rows 7 and 8 without any clear explanation. Table  shows the results of the likelihood ratio test. For all lines and body regions  including a random cage effect or a random animal effect improved the goodness of fit significantly (all P-values < 0.001 or < 0.01  respectively). Table  and Additional file : Table S1 show the estimated genetic parameters obtained with the classical animal model. Using univariate analysis  heritabilities () for FCS of the different regions and for total FCS were low  ranging from 1.5 to 9.8%. In previous studies   estimates for total FCS ranged from 22 to 54% [–]. To our knowledge  no  estimates for separate body regions have been reported in the literature. There are several reasons that could explain the difference in heritabilities between the present and previous studies. In the present study  FCS were recorded when the hens were 40 weeks of age  whereas in previous studies  they were recorded when hens were between 51 and 56 weeks of age [  ]. Kjaer and Sørensen [] reported that  of FP behaviour (inflicting and receiving FP) increased when hens grew older (69 weeks compared to 38 weeks). Using younger birds could explain the lower . A second reason for the lower  observed in this study relates to the use of individual records  records pooled by cage. We used individual records on four random hens of the same line kept in one cage  while Craig and Muir [] used the average FCS of cages of three full sibs  which has two effects. First  it averages residuals over cage members  which reduces residual variance () and thus increases heritability. Second  as demonstrated by Peeters et al. []  the analysis of cage averages yields an estimate of the total heritable variation ()  rather than of the ordinary (direct) additive genetic variance (). Thus  the estimate of Craig and Muir [] refers to  instead of . Together  those effects may explain the substantially higher  found by Craig and Muir []. Statistical comparison of the direct–indirect effects model (Equation ) and the classical animal model (Equation )  showed a significant improvement of the goodness of fit for both lines and for all body regions (Table ; all P-values<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 except P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.13 for belly in line W1)  providing evidence for indirect genetic effects on FCS for almost all body regions. Table  and Additional file : Table S2 show the estimated genetic parameters obtained with the direct–indirect effects model. Except for the direct–indirect genetic correlations  most of the genetic parameters were significantly different from zero for both lines. As expected  the standard deviation of the direct breeding value () for the different body regions was of similar magnitude as  from the classical animal model [see Additional file : Tables S1 and S2]. The magnitude of  is not affected  because groups are composed of non-relatives []. Overall  estimates for  and  were highest in line WB. For all body regions in both lines  the standard deviation of the total breeding value () was 1.3 to 4.0-fold larger than   which indicates substantial indirect genetic effects. Again  line WB yielded the highest . For the body regions with significant IGE  non-direct genetic effects explained 70 (neck line W1) to 94% (rump line WB) of the total heritable variation in FCS (Table ). In both lines  the contribution of non-direct genetic effects was highest for the rump region  explaining approximately 93% of the total heritable variation. Using univariate analysis  the total heritable variance expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance () ranged from 9.8 to 53.6% (Table ). Line WB yielded the highest . In this study  line WB had the lowest FCS  whereas line W1 had the highest FCS. Therefore  it was expected that the contribution of indirect effects would be highest in line WB  because FCS depends on the behaviour of group mates. The estimates of genetic parameters for direct and indirect effects found here were indeed in line with those expectations. Furthermore  estimated genetic parameters were in agreement with the results of Ellen et al. []  who showed that the total heritable variation in survival time was substantially larger than suggested by the classical animal model. The estimated breeding values obtained in our analysis also provide an elegant way of discriminating between individuals that inflict FP and have high EBV for indirect effects  and individuals that are victims of FP and have high EBV for direct effects  as was previously suggested by Biscarini et al. []. Estimating genetic parameters using the bivariate classical animal model and the bivariate direct–indirect effects model  both with mortality (0/1) at 40 weeks of age  did not result in significant changes of the estimated genetic parameters compared to the univariate analyses (Table ). Comparing log likelihoods of the bivariate model with a model in which the variance components were fixed to the estimates obtained from the univariate analysis  did not change the log likelihoods substantially (data not shown). Therefore  for this dataset  it is not necessary to use bivariate analyses with mortality to estimate genetic parameters for FCS of the different body regions. Estimates of genetic correlations from the direct–indirect effects model are in Table  and Additional file : Table S3. In both lines  genetic correlations () were positive. The highest estimated genetic correlations were found between adjacent regions  whereas the lowest estimates were found between any region and belly (except for neck-belly in line WB). So far  there are no studies that report genetic correlations for FCS between different body regions. In previous studies  FCS of different body regions were combined and analyses were done on the total FCS [–]. In the present study  the high genetic correlations between adjacent regions (neck  back  and rump) suggest that these regions could be combined into a single total FCS. The on average low genetic correlations with belly damage suggest that belly is a distinct trait (except for neck-belly in line WB  which suggests that neck and belly could be combined in a single FCS for this line). FP in the belly region may be closely related with cannibalistic vent pecking. Vent pecking and FP are caused by different internal and external factors []. Furthermore  FP is thought to be a redirected foraging behaviour []  whereas vent pecking seems to be a separate form of damaging behaviour [  ]. In addition  when comparing the contribution of direct effects to the total heritable variation (Table )  belly has a larger contribution of direct effects than the other body regions  while the contribution of indirect effects is lower for belly. This could indicate that a different behaviour is associated with pecking on the belly. Therefore  the belly region should be analysed separately and should not be included in the total FCS  as also reported by Parmentier et al. []. Furthermore  Bilcik and Keeling [] showed that feathers of the belly were pulled out more easily  which might overestimate the FCS due to FP. FCS was recorded by four persons  which could introduce bias due to incomplete correlation of FCS scores. The phenotypic correlation between observers was greater than 0.84 for neck  back  and rump  but was as low as 0.64 for belly (data not shown). The largest difference in means of the persons recording FCS was found for neck (for further details see Additional file : Table S4). Adams et al. [] reported a mean correlation of 0.88 between total FCS recorded by three persons. To investigate the effect of the person recording the FCS on genetic parameters: (1) heterogeneity of residual variance was evaluated by fitting a separate residual variance for person and (2) genetic correlations between persons were estimated using the classical animal model (data not shown). Accounting for heterogeneous residual variances did not change the estimated genetic parameters. Therefore  homogeneous residual variance was assumed. Genetic correlations of total FCS between persons were greater than 0.80 for both lines  which indicates only minor differences in FCS between persons at the genetic level. In this study  we showed that a substantial part of the total genetic variation in plumage condition of different body regions in two purebred layer lines is due to IGE. Accounting for IGE in the genetic analysis showed that total heritable variation was up to 9-fold greater than suggested by results of the classical animal model. Thus  using breeding programs that exploit the heritable variation due to IGE can considerably accelerate response to selection on FCS. In previous studies  FP was significantly related with lower FCS [  ]. Since FP can result in death (referred to as cannibalism) []  it is worthwhile to investigate whether FCS at 40 weeks of age can be used as a predictor for survival at the end of the laying period. In this study  we showed that genetic correlations are high between FCS for adjacent body regions  whereas FCS for belly can be considered as a distinct trait  which suggests that neck  back and rump can be combined into a total FCS. However  before drawing this conclusion  it is important to investigate whether total FCS  total FCS (without belly)  or separate body regions can be used as predictor for survival at the end of the laying period. This could contribute to reducing an important welfare problem in laying hens. Regardless  both breeding and management solutions should be applied to prevent FP. Measuring the plumage condition by recording FCS is time-consuming. Moreover  laying hens need to be at least 40 weeks before FCS can be recorded  and FCS measured on selection candidates is not very useful  because selection candidates are housed individually. Hence  selection would have to be based on sib or progeny information. These obstacles can be overcome by using genomic selection [  ]. Our results clearly show that genetic improvement of plumage condition cannot rely on DGE only. Therefore  genomic selection methods must be extended to accommodate IGE. A challenge is how to design a reference population that is suitable for genomic selection on plumage condition and survival time in laying hens. Social interactions have a substantial effect on plumage condition in laying hens. This study shows that  for the different body regions (neck  back  rump  and belly)  the total heritable variance of FCS  expressed as the proportion of the phenotypic variance () ranges from 9.8 (rump line W1) to 53.6% (total FCS). A substantial part  70 to 94%  of the total heritable variation relates to IGE. Thus  it is expected that including both direct and indirect effects in a genetic selection program will contribute to a reduction in FP behaviour  one of the major welfare issues in the laying hen industry.

By modifying the input values  such as herd size and genotyping strategy  a flexible spreadsheet tool developed from this work can be used to estimate the additional costs associated with genome-enabled selection. This tool will aid breeders in estimating the economic viability of incorporating genome-enabled selection into their specific breeding program. The common method to estimate breeding values and rank animals based on genetic merit is known as traditional BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) selection. Traditional BLUP selection relies on phenotypic information measured directly on selection candidates and their relatives to predict the genetic merit for all animals. If molecular information is included in the selection program  historically it would have been in the form of marker-assisted selection for which only a few markers are used []. With advances in molecular technology and new biological tools  researchers have established ways to incorporate variation at the DNA level into breeding programs. When breeders incorporate the variation from genomic information into a selection strategy  it is known as genome-enabled selection. This information is used to enhance traditional breeding value estimation. Estimating an animal’s genetic merit at the molecular level may improve estimated breeding value (EBV) accuracy []. This improved accuracy could further increase the rate of genetic gain for the population. Traits that are lowly heritable  difficult to measure  sex-limited  measured later in life  or measured after slaughter  have the greatest potential for accuracy improvement when using genome-enabled breeding value estimation compared to traits that can be directly measured on all the candidates before selection. Using a low-density marker panel can be an effective method to reduce genotyping costs once the initial dataset has been established. An initial population is needed to determine population haplotypes so that imputation can be used to infer genotypes from a low-density marker panel. Inferring high-density genotypes from a low-density panel is known as imputation []. When imputation is used  selection candidates are genotyped using low-density panels and the actual selected animals are commonly re-genotyped using a high-density marker panel. To further reduce costs  companies may choose to genotype only males. While this saves costs  genomic EBV accuracy for genotyped animals may be reduced  especially for sex-limited or novel traits for which phenotypic data are not routinely collected. The objective of this study was to develop a tool to estimate the cost structure associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into commercial breeding programs. Estimating an animal’s genetic merit using genomic information can improve the accuracy of EBV; however  this improved accuracy should be large enough to recover the costs associated with implementing genome-enabled selection. Most commercial market hogs are the offspring from a mating between a female that is a cross between two maternal lines and a male that is from a terminal line. The three lines can be purebred  synthetic  or some composite of the same type. Therefore  each maternal line contributes 25% of the genetic material to commercial animals  and the terminal line makes up the other 50%. One maternal line is typically derived from a Landrace population  while the other maternal line is usually derived from a Large White population. The terminal line is often derived from a Duroc population. Each maternal line nucleus was assumed to have 1000 sows while the terminal nucleus had 600 sows. All three lines must be selected for improved performance at the commercial level  and thus  EBV must be estimated for each line. The terminal line is typically selected based on a terminal sire index that can consist of growth  meat quality  and carcass traits. The maternal lines are often selected based on a maternal line index  which comprises reproductive traits that are more heavily emphasized in the index and some terminal market traits. When considering the costs associated with genome-enabled selection  one has to consider not only the genotyping costs  but also other ancillary expenses. In the present analysis  genotyping costs were assumed to be US$115 and US$55 for the high- and low-density panels  respectively. These costs include the cost of the genotyping and all other costs associated with sample collection  DNA isolation and storage  shipping  etc. Genotyping costs will vary depending on the number of animals genotyped and the company used. Additionally  genotyping costs will change (increase or decrease) as new tests become available. For each of the three lines  it was assumed that the initial data consisted of 2000 ancestor animals that were genotyped using the high-density marker panel. Developing genome-enabled EBV requires more time and computing power compared to traditional BLUP EBV. For this analysis  it was assumed that eight months were required to analyze the initial dataset and develop the program that will be implemented for genetic evaluations. Based on personal communications with a large swine genetics company  an additional 8 hours was assumed to be needed with each weekly evaluation to prepare data and to ensure the program runs without errors. It was assumed that the EBV development and additional weekly work would cost US$60/hour in employee wages and benefits. A US$50 000 investment was assumed for computing infrastructure. This cost includes equipment and labor associated with set-up. For this study  the infrastructure cost was distributed across the three lines included in the breeding program based on the relative proportion of nucleus sows in each line. For this analysis  it was assumed that the costs of the investment are expected to be recovered within three years. In other words  a three-year planning horizon was assumed. The infrastructure costs were assumed to have no salvage value at the end of the planning horizon. A 5% discounting rate [] was used to calculate the present value of the nominal annual costs associated with genome-enabled selection. When assessing cost structure within a genome-enabled selection program  the infrastructure costs are nominal relative to the annual genotyping costs. Therefore  a longer planning horizon would not greatly impact the total annual costs associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into the breeding program. A longer planning horizon would allow accumulated genetic improvement in multiple generations to help offset the additional costs. Once an initial dataset has been collected and analyzed  routine genotype collection can be scheduled for selection candidates within each line in the breeding program. All the offspring produced from the nucleus breeding herd are potential selection candidates. The number of potential selection candidates and the genetic sampling will determine how many selection candidates in a given year must be genotyped. For this analysis  all male and female selection candidates were expected to be genotyped at low density and then all animals used for actual breeding were re-genotyped at high density in both maternal lines. While genotyping both males and females is optimal for increased annual genetic gain and reduced inbreeding  it is not required to obtain genetic improvement using genome-enabled selection []. Only male selection candidates were genotyped for the terminal line  and boars selected to become sires within the nucleus were re-genotyped at high density. Only males are genotyped in the terminal line since most terminal line selection indices do not include sex-limited traits  reducing the value of genotyping females. This genotyping scheme is representative of the strategy currently implemented in the swine industry. Another way to reduce the annual genotyping costs would be to genotype only a proportion of available male and/or female selection candidates. Henryon et al. [] showed that only 5 to 20% of the selection candidates must be genotyped in order to capture most of the genetic gain realized from genotyping all of the selection candidates. The animals to be genotyped could be preselected based on their genetic potential estimated using traditional BLUP methods []. Genetic suppliers have different marketing schemes. Revenues are obtained by selling boars  selling semen doses  or charging weaned pig fees. However  a weaned pig fee can be converted into the price of a dose or boar based on how many commercial weaned pigs are produced by nucleus boars. For the maternal lines  it was assumed that  on average  each litter in the nucleus herd consisted of 11 pigs born alive [] with a 1:1 sex ratio []. Each sow was assumed to have 2.3 litters a year  on average []. The combined pre-weaning and nursery mortality was assumed to be 12% []. These assumptions result in 22 264 animals (1000 sows<U+2009>×<U+2009>2.3 litters<U+2009>×<U+2009>11 pigs<U+2009>×<U+2009>0.88 survival; 11 132 males and 11 132 females) to be genotyped annually at low density in each maternal line. With 5% and 20% selection for males and females []  respectively  557 males (11 132<U+2009>×<U+2009>0.05) and 2226 females (11 132<U+2009>×<U+2009>0.20) will be re-genotyped with the high-density panel annually in each maternal line. These represent the number of animals selected  but not all animals will be successful  reproductive members of the breeding herd. The average sow production in the terminal line nucleus herd was assumed to be 10 pigs born alive per litter with a 1:1 sex ratio [] and 2.1 litters per sow per year []. The total mortality through the nursery was assumed to be 12%  as for the maternal lines. This means that 5544 male pigs are produced and genotyped at low density in the terminal line nucleus herd  annually. Assuming 5% male selection  277 males would be re-genotyped with a high-density panel. The top 5% of the boars produced in the nucleus herd based on genome-enabled EBV are assumed to be used as nucleus replacements in the maternal and terminal lines. The top 60% of male candidates in the sire line were used in the commercial production system for the terminal line. Boars were assumed to produce 25 semen doses weekly with 15% of doses being discarded due to semen quality issues []. It was assumed that 25% of selected boars would not reach production due to infertility  disease  etc. All boars used for reproduction within the nucleus or at the commercial level were assumed to be used to maximum capacity  meaning that all doses that are not discarded are used for insemination. This means that 461 282 and 2 756 754 doses were produced annually from the maternal line boars and terminal line boars  respectively. For example  the annual doses produced in a terminal line would be calculated as 5544 selection candidates<U+2009>×<U+2009>75% productive<U+2009>×<U+2009>60% used<U+2009>×<U+2009>25 doses per week<U+2009>×<U+2009>85% viable semen<U+2009>×<U+2009>52 weeks. This formula assumes that the boars have an average production life of one year. The total number of weaned pigs produced each year from the semen doses collected was calculated as 1 940 845 and 10 544 584 for the maternal and terminal lines  respectively. The number of total weaned pigs produced each year was calculated by multiplying the expected number of litters by the number of pigs weaned in a litter. This was based on 10% pre-weaning mortality in the commercial herd  two doses of semen per sow serviced  and an 85% farrowing rate for commercial sows with 10 and 11 pigs born alive per litter in the terminal and maternal lines  respectively []. For example  the number of weaned pigs produced from the terminal boars was calculated as 2 756 754 doses / 2 doses per service<U+2009>×<U+2009>85% farrowing rate<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 pigs/litter<U+2009>×<U+2009>90% survival to weaning. For the maternal lines  40% of the gilts developed were assumed to never produce a litter []  and for the sows that farrowed at least one litter  it was assumed that each sow produced 35 weaned pigs per lifetime  on average []. For this study  it was assumed that the commercial producers would have an internal multiplication program for replacement gilts  and thus  genetic improvement at the commercial level would be realized through purchasing semen doses and/or boars from the genetic supplier. A spreadsheet was developed to calculate the total estimated costs associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into a swine breeding program. The spreadsheet can calculate the accumulated costs for up to six different genetic lines that could be used to create a commercial animal. The nucleus herd size and nucleus production levels (i.e. number born alive  litters per sow per year  mortality  and boar production) can be changed to reflect the production system of the user. Which selection candidates are sampled on an annual basis can be altered to depict the strategy that the company anticipates implementing. Similarly  the spreadsheet can account for additional phenotyping costs associated with a novel trait being added to the selection criteria. Additionally  the spreadsheet can account for a multiplication factor if the genetic supplier has a multiplication level within their system. The total start-up cost was US$326 031 for both maternal lines and US$318 338 for the terminal line. This includes the costs associated with developing the genome-enabled EBV and the genotyping of the initial dataset. The annual costs of routine genotyping were US$1 569 525 and US$361 758 for the maternal and terminal lines  respectively. Assuming a three-year planning horizon and a 5% discounting rate []  the increased revenue for the maternal and terminal lines must be US$1 698 814.68 and US$491 047.68  respectively  in order to break even on the increased costs associated with incorporating genomic information into the selection program. Infrastructure costs are relatively small compared to genotyping costs; therefore  the annual total cost and cost per weaned pig are relatively insensitive to changes in the infrastructure costs. Investments are routinely evaluated for their return on investment  which in turn is often annualized in order to evaluate yearly expenses relative to income. In the swine industry  genetic companies will incur the costs associated with genome-enabled selection. How genetic suppliers market their animals will govern how the costs are recovered. Some companies may sell boars or replacements while other companies may receive royalties based on the number of pigs weaned by their customers. For this study  it was assumed that the genetic company making the investment in genome-enabled selection receives royalties from weaned pigs at the commercial level. Dividing the annualized costs by the number of semen doses per year  results in costs of US$3.68 and US$0.18 per dose in the maternal and terminal lines  respectively. To calculate the cost per nucleus boar  the annualized cost was divided by the number of boars used for commercial production (male selection candidates<U+2009>×<U+2009>percent used). The cost per nucleus boar was US$3052.13 and US$147.62 for the maternal and terminal lines  respectively. Using the total number of female pigs produced annually from the maternal nucleus herds (1 940 845/2)  it was determined that genome-enabled selection costs would be approximately US$2.92 per nucleus daughter (F1 cross between two maternal lines). This number was calculated from dividing the annualized costs by the number of productive sows produced from the nucleus boars  accounting for the gilt drop out percent. Assuming that each sow produced 35 weaned pigs in her lifetime  there is a US$0.083 cost per weaned pig in the commercial production system for each maternal line (US$2.92/35). The cost per weaned pig in the commercial herd was determined to be US$0.047 for the terminal line  assuming that 10 544 584 weaned pigs are produced annually. This means that US$0.21 per weaned pig from boars produced in the nucleus would need to be added to the genetic merit for each market pig in order to break even on the additional cost associated with genome-enabled selection for all three lines. The marketing structure for the genetic supplier will determine how the additional costs associated with genome-enabled selection can or will be recovered from commercial sales. The current rate of genetic gain in the nucleus will determine the proportional increase in rate of genetic gain needed to recover genome-enabled selection costs. According to the National Swine Registry  the current rate of annual genetic gain for their terminal line index is US$0.30  US$0.40  and US$0.30 per weaned pig for the Duroc  Landrace  and Large White populations  respectively []. The traits  days to market  weight gained from weaned to slaughter  and feed efficiency were included in the terminal sire index []. The rate of genetic gain for number of born alive is 0.08 and 0.07 pigs per year for Landrace and Large White lines  respectively. Thus  the total annual genetic improvement for both maternal lines would be US$0.432 and US$0.321 for the Landrace and Large White lines  respectively. This rate of genetic gain may be lower than gains expected from most swine genetic companies. For each maternal line  the total genetic improvement value is calculated by multiplying the terminal improvement by 1 plus the increase in number of born alive ($0.40<U+2009>×<U+2009>1.08 for Landrace  and $0.30<U+2009>×<U+2009>1.07 for Large White). If the genetic supplier is part of an integrated system  then the total genetic improvement from a maternal line would be calculated as the terminal line improvement plus the carcass value of the additional pigs born alive. This would be $9.43 for Landrace and $8.20 for Large White assuming 25% mortality from birth to finisher  114 kg market weight  and $1.32/kg market price. An integrated producer could recover the costs of genome-enabled selection by benefiting from improved production efficiency in the commercial segment or by increasing retail prices for the consumer while a genetic company would have to recover the costs of genome-enabled selection by increasing the premiums placed on their genetic product or by increasing market share. The increased price must be justified by an increased rate of genetic gain. A commercial producer will not necessarily pay for the full value of genetic improvement it will receive. The genetic supplier will only receive some percentage of the value of the improvement made based on the incremental improvement in genetic potential from one year to the next. The current expected improvement in genetic merit at the commercial level and the relative additional improvement needed to pay for incorporating genome-enabled selection into the breeding program are illustrated in Figure . Considering that 50% of the terminal line index improvement (US$0.15/weaned pig) in the Duroc line would be passed on to the commercial herd and that the cost estimate for genome-enabled selection in the terminal line was US$0.044 per weaned pig  this would mean that a 31% improvement (US$0.047/US$0.15) in the genetic gain rate would be needed to recover the genome-enabled selection costs. Considering this and the fact that 25% of the improvement occurring in each of the two maternal lines will be passed on to the commercial animals  77% (US$0.083/US$0.108) and 104% (US$0.083/US$0.080) improvement in genetic gain rate is needed for the Landrace and Large White populations  respectively. Because of the planning horizon used in this study and by most swine genetic companies  these returns are based on one round of genetic improvement; however  differential genetic improvements made with genome-enabled selection will be accumulated over time.  Current rates of genetic improvement were based on genetic improvement published by the National Swine Registry for each of the three lines; the cost of genome-enabled selection was estimated using the values reported in this paper. These results reflect the necessary increase in genetic improvement at the nucleus level to break even on the estimated genome-enabled selection costs provided that the realized genetic improvement in commercial animals is equivalent to the expected genetic improvement. Environmental factors may reduce the realized genetic improvement at the commercial levels compared to the expected improvement based on predictions of genetic merit derived from data recorded in the nucleus production environment. Greater nucleus level genetic improvement would be required if all genetic improvement that occurs at the nucleus population is not realized or does not actually occur at the commercial production level. Another way to recover the costs associated with genome-enabled selection is through maintaining or capturing increased market share. If a company must invest in genome-enabled selection to maintain their current market share  there must be some perceived marketing value associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into the breeding program. If a marketing value exists  the difference between the total costs associated with genome-enabled selection per weaned pig and the marketing value is the increased value in genetic improvement that must be achieved to break even on the investment in genome-enabled selection. Thus  the necessary increase in genetic improvement to break even would not be as large as if the costs must be recovered through increasing genetic potential alone. Without increasing the nucleus herd size  the only way to increase the market share is to increase the proportion of male offspring produced in the nucleus herd that are used to produce commercial piglets. The relationship between the proportion of nucleus boars used and proportion of improvement in genetic gain rate for the terminal and maternal lines are shown in Figures  and   respectively. For example  if 80% of the male candidates in the terminal line were used  compared to the 60% used in this study  the proportional improvement in rate of genetic gain needed to break even on the investment in genome-enabled selection would be 22% compared to 29%. The feasible region  or the region where the costs of genome-enabled selection are recovered  is shaded in gray. The gray area not on the break even line indicates that a profit is made. For the results in Figure   it was assumed that the current rate of genetic gain in the commercial animals was US$0.15 per pig from the terminal line. The current rate of genetic gain in the commercial animals was assumed to be US$0.10 per pig from the maternal line for the results in Figure .  The current annual rate of genetic improvement was assumed to be US$0.15 per commercial pig; the number of commercial pigs produced from the nucleus boars was calculated using the values reported in the paper; the estimated cost of genome-enabled selection in the terminal line was US$491 048; this number was estimated using the strategy in this paper.  The current annual rate of genetic improvement was assumed to be US$0.10 per commercial pig; the number of commercial pigs produced from the nucleus boars was calculated using the values reported in the paper; the estimated cost of genome-enabled selection in the terminal line was US$1 698 815; this number was estimated using the strategy in this paper. The primary expected benefit from incorporating genomic information into EBV estimation is improved accuracy []. Due to the direct relationship between accuracy and rate of genetic gain  increasing EBV accuracy will proportionally increase the rate of genetic gain expected given that selection intensity and generation interval remain constant. This increase in accuracy will have to be sufficiently large to recover the added costs associated with using genomic information in the selection program. Genome-enabled selection will not eliminate the need for phenotype collection. Earlier theories associated with genome-enabled selection suggested that one benefit would be the cost savings associated with reducing or eliminating the collection of phenotypic data []; however  due to the decay in accuracy associated with genomic breeding values over generations  genomic breeding values must be re-estimated periodically and phenotypic records will be needed []. The application of genomic breeding values has been investigated for pig populations. Nielsen and coworkers showed the correlation between genomic breeding values and traditional BLUP breeding values to be 0.62 for the 170 boars used in their data set []. Cleveland and collaborators reported the accuracy of the genomic breeding value for the total number of pigs born per litter to be between 0.64 and 0.82  depending on the initial dataset used []. The authors reported that the accuracy of stillborns per litter ranged from 0.33 to 0.68. Dekkers [] developed a method using selection index theory to calculate the genetic response expected from incorporating genomic information into a selection index. The method deterministically calculated the genetic response anticipated from using genomic selection with defined genetic parameters. The study showed that  for a trait recorded on both sexes prior to selection  selection based on markers alone can improve response by 8.5% compared to selection based only on phenotypic information. Based on stochastic simulations  annual genetic gain could be increased by 23 to 91% for a maternal line [] and 27 to 33% for a terminal line []. Based on these increases in annual genetic gain  there is potential for genome-enabled selection to be profitable for both maternal and terminal line selection programs. Under simulated conditions  MAS could increase genetic improvement from selection for meat quality  net or residual feed intake  and number of pigs born alive compared to the response from traditional BLUP. Under these simulated conditions  the largest gap between marker-assisted selection and traditional BLUP occurred for the meat quality traits; however  no genetic improvement in rate of genetic gain was observed for growth when comparing marker-assisted and traditional BLUP selection methods under these simulated conditions []. This suggests that the greatest potential for improvement in the rate of genetic gain from genome-enabled selection will be for lowly heritable traits that are difficult to measure  sex limited  measured later in life or measured after slaughter  such as meat quality  disease resistance  feed efficiency  and longevity. Disease resistance is not easily defined and not systematically measured. Feed efficiency is expensive to measure directly  especially on an individual animal basis. Sow longevity is not recorded until the sow is culled from the herd and is a trait that is only measured on females. If traits are not currently measured and recorded  additional costs associated with measuring the novel traits will be connected with genome-enabled selection if these traits are targeted in a selection program. For a novel trait to be incorporated into a selection program  a measureable phenotype associated with the trait must be clearly defined. Depending on the phenotype  there may be a significant cost associated with the infrastructure needed to collect the data. Using genomic information to estimate an animal’s genetic merit at the molecular level can improve EBV accuracy when compared to an EBV based only on phenotypic records. However  genome-enabled selection is expensive and the increase in rate of genetic gain must be large enough to offset the costs associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into a breeding program. A flexible spreadsheet tool (accessible at the Iowa Pork Industry Center website: ) developed from this work can be used to estimate the returns needed to recover additional costs associated with genome-enabled selection by modifying the input values such as herd size and genotyping strategy to represent the specific design of any production system.

For part of the QTL  the concordant analyses narrowed QTL regions down to a limited number of genes  of which some are known for their role in limb or skeletal development in humans and mice. Mutations in these genes are good candidates for QTN (quantitative trait nucleotides) influencing rear leg set side view. A large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been detected since the availability of genetic markers. However  the mutations that underlie such QTL have been identified only in a few cases[]. Even reasonably fine-mapped QTL regions of around 2 Mb can still contain multiple genes with a large number of potential causative mutations. Thus  the step from QTL to causative mutations remains difficult. The present availability of whole-genome sequence data provides new opportunities to narrow down QTL regions to causative mutations[]. One approach to do this is to eliminate a large number of potential candidate mutations by concordance analysis  which compares the QTL status (homozygous or heterozygous) with status of polymorphisms in the QTL region across genotyped individuals. Assuming a single mutation is responsible for a QTL  an animal will be homozygous for this mutation when it is homozygous for the QTL and heterozygous when it is heterozygous for the QTL[]. Using this principle  Karlsson et al.[] were able to reduce the number of candidate causative mutations by 37% for a locus that affects coat colour in dogs. Although quantitative traits are influenced by several mutations rather than a single mutation  concordance between a candidate mutation and the QTL genotype can provide evidence when searching for causative mutations. For example  in a study that focused on a QTL for milk yield and composition on chromosome 6  concordant polymorphisms were found only in the  gene[]. With the increasing availability of sequence data  such a concordance analysis can be done on a larger scale and could be helpful to reduce the often very large number of candidate mutations in a QTL interval. When a concordance analysis is used for all polymorphisms in a QTL region  it is necessary to set a very low probability of concordance by chance to avoid type 1 errors. The probability of concordance by chance decreases with the number of individuals with predicted statuses[]. QTL statuses can be derived using a granddaughter design[] but not all sequenced animals will have a sufficient number of progeny to infer QTL status accurately. A method that provides QTL status for all sequenced individuals is therefore desirable. Rear leg side view (RLSV) is a quantitative trait recorded in dairy cattle that measures the angle of the hock. Large deviations from the average score are associated with a higher culling rate[]. Although several QTL for RLSV have been detected[  ]  the causative mutations that underlie these QTL are unknown. In this study  we used RLSV as an example trait to assess the effectiveness of concordance analysis to narrow down from a QTL region to candidate mutations. First  QTL regions were defined  then the QTL status was derived for a large number of individuals and a concordance analysis was performed. Genotypes of 3154 Holstein bulls were used for QTL mapping. These bulls were nearly all Holstein artificial insemination bulls born between 1999 and 2004  owned and progeny-tested by the five major French breeding companies. The genotypes were obtained with the Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip®[] by Labogena. Quality control included: test of cluster quality  which was performed at the genotyping laboratory level; minimum SNP call rate of 99%; Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p<U+2009><<U+2009>10); minimum call rate of 98%; parentage checking. These tests  as well as imputation and phasing  were performed upstream of this study  in the routine pipeline of genomic selection. After removal of markers with a minor allele frequency below 0.05  39 683 autosomal markers were retained for analysis. For all bulls  deregressed estimated breeding values (EBV) of RLSV were used for QTL mapping. Deregressed EBV were obtained using a procedure similar to[]  except that when computing the weight   we assumed that 100% of the genetic variance was explained by the SNPs. This leads to  with being the reliability of the EBV of bull  from progeny information only. The expectation of the bull EBV without progeny information is the pedigree index (PI)  leading to the following deregressed EBV: QTL mapping was done using Bayes C[]  as implemented in the GS3 software[] according to the following statistical model: where  is the deregressed EBV for individual    the overall mean   the polygenic breeding value of individual    the number of markers   the genotype of individual  for marker   coded 0  1 or 2 depending on the number of copies of the second marker allele   the additive effect of marker   and  the random residual for individual . All unknown parameters were assigned prior distributions and sampled with a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) using Gibbs sampling. The MCMC was run for 180 000 iterations  with a burn-in of 20 000 iterations and a thin interval of 50. The prior used for  was a mixture distribution that equals: where is the common marker variance and the hyper parameter p is the prior probability that the effect of marker  is equal to 0. Variances  and were assigned inverted chi-square distributions with <U+2009>=<U+2009>4.2 degrees of freedom and scale parameter where is the prior value for  or. Parameter p was fixed at 0.99  following[]. To select QTL regions for further analyses  intervals of 40 adjacent markers (corresponding on average to 2.5 Mb) were ranked based on the sum of their posterior inclusion probabilities (<U+2211>p). The posterior inclusion probability of a marker is the proportion of iterations that included the marker in the model. Since our aim was to select the largest QTL rather than all QTL  the 20 intervals with the highest <U+2211>p were selected and denoted as QTL. If intervals overlapped  only the interval with the highest <U+2211>p was selected. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers in the QTL regions was computed using Lewontin’s normalised LD measure (D’)[] and estimated with Haploview 4.2[]. To see if QTL regions overlapped with QTL regions for other traits  QTL mapping was also performed for the following traits: milk yield  fat yield  protein yield  fat content  protein content  somatic cell count  udder depth  rear udder height  fore udder attachment  locomotion  body depth  chest width  milking speed  udder support  rear teat placement  rear leg side view  stature  rump angle  rump width  front teat placement  front teat length  temperament  angularity  rear leg rear view  foot angle  direct calving ease  maternal calving ease  direct stillbirth  maternal stillbirth  interval from calving to first insemination  longevity  and clinical mastitis. QTL status was determined for all individuals in the QTL mapping analyses. In addition  for 33 bulls not included in the 50 K QTL mapping dataset  50 K genotypes from Eurogenomics[] were used to infer their QTL status  as described in[]  so that we could include them in the concordance analysis. The procedure to determine the QTL status of an individual is summarised in Figure . For each of the selected QTL regions  the marker effects estimated during QTL mapping were used to infer the QTL status as follows. First  genotypes were phased to define haplotypes  using DagPhase[]  while accounting for family structure. For each of the two haplotypes of an individual  a haplotype effect  was estimated based on a summation of estimated marker effects:. This was done either for all markers in the QTL region  or for the 10  20 or 30 adjacent markers with the highest <U+2211>p in the region. Subsequently  the difference between the estimated effects of the two haplotypes was used to determine if an individual was homozygous or heterozygous: if both haplotypes had similar effects  the individual was homozygous  while if the difference between the two haplotypes was substantially larger than 0  the individual was heterozygous. Individuals were grouped based on the absolute value of the difference between two estimated haplotype effects using the following posterior around methods (PAM)[]  as implemented in the fpc R-package[]:                                                       medoids were randomly selected from the data. All non-medoids were assigned to the closest medoid. The costs of configuration when medoid and data point are switched were calculated using Euclidean distance. The configuration with the lowest cost was selected. Steps 2 and 3 were repeated until the medoids remained equal. The number of clusters () was estimated based on the optimum average silhouette[]  using two  three  or four groups. The QTL status of animals in the cluster with the lowest haplotype difference was denoted homozygous  and that of animals in the cluster with the highest difference was denoted heterozygous. If more than two clusters were present  the QTL status of animals in the other clusters was denoted unknown. The concordance analysis compares the estimated QTL status with the genotype of polymorphisms present in the QTL region across individuals. Genotypes of 71 Holstein bulls for polymorphisms detected in the 1000 Bull Genomes project[] were used for the concordance analysis. For each QTL  a list of polymorphisms present in the QTL region and the corresponding genotypes of the individuals were obtained. Polymorphisms included both SNPs and indels. Regardless of the interval size used for status prediction  the initially detected 40-marker QTL intervals were considered for the concordance analysis. Subsequently  the status of the polymorphisms was compared with the QTL status across individuals. Polymorphisms were only compared with the QTL status of a certain individual if the genotype quality score of the sequence in that individual was equal to 20 or higher. The probability of polymorphisms being concordant by chance was calculated following Ron et al.[]: where  is the allele frequency of the reference allele  and  and  the number of heterozygous and homozygous individuals  respectively. A polymorphism was considered concordant with a QTL if: at least 90% of the individuals were either homozygous for both the polymorphism and the QTL or heterozygous for both the polymorphism and the QTL  its genotype quality score was equal to 20 or higher for at least five homozygous and five heterozygous individuals  and its probability of concordance by chance ( ) was lower than 1 divided by the total number of polymorphisms present in the QTL region. For the concordant polymorphisms  annotations were obtained using the “variant effect predictor” application from Ensembl[] to generate the functional consequences of polymorphisms. QTL for RLSV were detected on chromosomes 1  3  5  6  8  10  11  13  14  15  18  19  23  26  28  and 29. Figure  shows the distribution of <U+2211>p along the genome and the selected QTL regions. The 20 selected QTL regions with their location and <U+2211>p are in Table . The <U+2211>p for the QTL regions ranged from 1.08 to 1.72 when using 40-marker intervals. Reducing the size of the interval to 30  20 or 10 markers changed the order of intervals. When intervals of 30 markers were considered  the four largest QTL remained the same but the ranking of most other QTL changed. With an interval size of 10 markers  the ranking was completely different  with the exception of QTL 3.  Selected QTL are indicated with red dots. There was a large variation in the distribution of the estimated haplotype differences. When the complete 40-marker interval used for QTL mapping was taken into account for QTL status prediction  there was no visible separation between homozygous and heterozygous individuals and thus  it was not possible to predict QTL status accurately for most QTL and individuals. With an interval size of 40 markers  individuals were successfully separated in two distinct groups for only three of the 20 QTL  QTL 11  15  and 19. For three other QTL  QTL 3  13  and 20  individuals were grouped in more than two groups  thus putting a group with unknown status between the homozygous and heterozygous individuals. Reducing the interval size improved the status derivation: with 10-marker intervals  a separation between homozygous and heterozygous individuals could be observed for most QTL. For half of the QTL  i.e. QTL 4  6  9  11  12  14  15  18  19 and 20  two clearly separated clusters were obtained  while for QTL 1  3  7  13 and 17  individuals were clustered in more than two groups. However  for QTL 2  5  8  10 and 16  distinguishing between homozygous and heterozygous individuals remained difficult. Therefore  these QTL were not used for subsequent concordance analysis. For the QTL with inferred status  the numbers of individuals that were predicted to be homozygous  heterozygous and unknown for the QTL are in Table . Figure  shows the status prediction with interval sizes of 10  20 or 40 adjacent markers for QTL 3  4  8 and 11. For QTL 11  a separation between homozygous and heterozygous individuals was observed with a 40-marker interval. Decreasing the interval size to 20 markers improved the distribution for QTL 3 and 4  and a further decrease to 10 markers resulted in clear separation between homozygous and heterozygous individuals for QTL 4  while for QTL 3  individuals were divided in three groups  homozygous  heterozygous and a middle group with an undetermined status. For QTL 8  no separation was observed  regardless of the interval size. For QTL 3  4  8 and 11  Figure  shows both the <U+2211>p and the posterior inclusion probability for each SNP. For QTL 11  there was one major peak in the interval  while several peaks were observed for QTL 3  4 and 8.  Haplotype effects were approximated by the sum of estimated marker effects for all markers in a haplotype.  QTL regions are indicated with red rectangles. The results of the concordance analysis for the 15 QTL for which status could be inferred are in Table . The number of concordant polymorphisms was on average equal to 70 and was generally lower for QTL for which the individuals were clustered in two groups than for QTL with more than two clusters  for which  on average  202 concordant polymorphisms were found. Because sequence errors are likely to occur  polymorphisms were considered concordant if they were concordant for at least 90% of the individuals  rather than setting a 100% concordance. If a 100% concordance had been set  the number of concordant polymorphisms would have been substantially reduced. Most QTL had no polymorphisms in complete concordance. Complete concordant polymorphisms were found only for QTL 9  13  14  15 and 18. Figure  shows the reduction in the number of concordance polymorphisms when the threshold of allowed errors was reduced from 10% to 0% for QTL 3  4 and 11. For QTL 3  for which the status of some of the animals was set to unknown  the number of concordant polymorphisms was reduced much more than for QTL 4 and 11 for which complete concordance was required. For QTL for which individuals were clustered in two groups  a large proportion of the concordant polymorphisms was still concordant when the error threshold was reduced to 5%  while for QTL for which individuals were clustered in more than two groups  a much lower proportion of polymorphisms remained concordant.                                                      The number of concordant polymorphisms for the QTL for which individuals were clustered in two groups ranged from 3 for QTL 12 to 340 for QTL 15. Figure  shows LD plots for QTL 9  11 and 15. The two regions that contained concordant polymorphisms for QTL 9 were in high LD with other regions  but only in complete LD with each other. Concordant polymorphisms for QTL 11 were all located in the same region  which was in low LD with other segments of the QTL region. The two blocks that contained concordant polymorphisms for QTL 15 were in complete LD with each other.  LD between markers in the QTL interval was estimated by D’; blocks containing concordant polymorphisms are indicated with black rectangles. The concordant polymorphisms for QTL for which haplotype effects clustered in two groups  were located in at most two genes  while concordant polymorphisms for QTL for which effects clustered in more than two groups  were generally spread over a larger number of genes. For QTL 4  42 polymorphisms were in concordance  of which four were intergenic  26 were in introns of the  gene  one was in an intron of the  gene  and one was upstream of this gene. Twelve of the 15 concordant polymorphisms for QTL 6 were intronic variants of the  gene  while the remaining three polymorphisms were located in the downstream region of the same gene. Of the eight concordant polymorphisms found for QTL 9  seven were intronic variants of the  gene and one polymorphism was located downstream of a microRNA gene. For QTL 12  only three intergenic polymorphisms were in concordance with the QTL. The number of comparisons that could be made for two of these variants was limited due to the low quality of the sequence at these positions for most individuals. Almost all of the 102 concordant polymorphisms for QTL 14 were intergenic  except for two polymorphisms located upstream of the  gene. For QTL 15  340 polymorphisms were concordant  of which 115 were intergenic  one was upstream of the  gene  197 were in introns of the  gene  and 27 were upstream of this gene. All 63 and 65 concordant polymorphisms for QTL 18 and 20  respectively  were intergenic. The 35 concordant polymorphisms for QTL 19 were all intronic variants of the  gene. The concordant polymorphisms for QTL 1  3 and 13 were scattered over a large number of genes. QTL 7 had the largest number of concordant polymorphisms  i.e. 441  of which 197 were intergenic  two were in non-coding exons of a 5S rRNA  39 and 13 were respectively downstream and upstream variants of the same 5S rRNA  196 were in introns of the  gene  and 34 were upstream variants of this gene. In total  187 polymorphisms were in concordance with QTL 17. Of these polymorphisms  113 were intergenic  three were downstream variants of a pseudogene  65 were intronic variants of the  gene and six were intronic variants of the  gene. Most of the QTL detected for RLSV also showed peaks in <U+2211>p for several other traits. Table  shows  for each QTL region  the traits that had a <U+2211>p of at least 0.8. In particular  in the intervals that contained QTL 10 and 15  peaks in <U+2211>p were observed for a large variety of traits. QTL 15 was  for example  also associated with milk yield  protein yield  fat content  protein content  somatic cell count  udder depth  udder support  angularity  maternal calving ease  longevity  clinical mastitis  and interval from calving to first insemination. Figure  shows the association between QTL 15 and several traits.  Sum of posterior inclusion probabilities (<U+2211>p) on chromosome 26 for milk yield  temperament  vitality at birth  longevity  clinical mastitis and interval from calving to first insemination with the QTL detected for rear leg side view indicated with a red rectangle. For 15 of the 20 QTL regions analysed  we were able to strongly reduce the number of candidate mutations by applying concordance analysis. For eight of these QTL  the regions were narrowed down to polymorphisms located in one or two genes. For most of the detected QTL  the distribution of the haplotype differences did not show a clear grouping when all markers in the QTL interval were used to compute the haplotype effects. This was especially the case for the QTL with a larger effect. All 20 QTL had a <U+2211>p larger than 1. <U+2211>p can be larger than 1 because several markers can together explain a QTL  and are thus simultaneously included in the model  or because more than one causative mutation may be present. It is likely that the largest QTL are affected by multiple mutations in the same region rather than by a single mutation. If these mutations have approximately the same effect  the distributions of estimated marker effects will overlap and it is not possible to distinguish between heterozygous individuals with different mutations  which can explain the difficulty in status prediction. When a smaller interval is used to infer the QTL status  fewer mutations will be located in the interval. As a consequence  QTL status could be predicted for a much larger number of QTL when a smaller interval of 10 markers was used. The <U+2211>p of these intervals was much lower than the <U+2211>p for the complete interval  especially for the QTL for which there were difficulties with status prediction using the complete interval. For example  the highest <U+2211>p was equal to 1.72 when the 40-marker interval (QTL 1) was used  but dropped to 0.75 when only 10 markers were used. Although using the smaller interval size made it possible to infer the QTL status for a larger proportion of the QTL  this approach may ignore a major part of the QTL by focussing on a single mutation. A more detailed analysis is required to determine whether there are indeed multiple mutations present in these regions and to disentangle their effects. For example  by imputing SNPs to the sequence level for the complete QTL detection design  followed by an association study using the imputed sequences. Specifically  multiple causal variants in a QTL region can be tested using a multiple SNP association model in this region. Alternatively  it is possible to predict the QTL status of sires using progeny data[] but this requires data of a sufficiently large number of progeny. For most sires in our dataset  the amount of available data for progeny was not sufficient to accurately derive the QTL status. Thus  it would only be possible to predict the QTL status for a limited number of individuals  which would be too low for a large-scale concordance analysis. Furthermore  if the difficulties in status prediction are indeed due to the presence of multiple QTL in the same interval  then this will cause the same problems in status prediction using the granddaughter design. Concordance analysis could only be applied for the 15 QTL for which QTL status could be inferred. The number of concordant polymorphisms and the number of genes in which these polymorphisms were located varied widely. For the QTL for which the status could only be accurately inferred for part of the sequenced individuals  the concordant polymorphisms were spread over more genes than for the QTL for which the status could be inferred for all individuals. This shows that a large number of records is necessary to narrow a region down to one or two genes using concordance analysis. Apart from this  the success of concordance analysis also depends on the LD between polymorphisms. Nearby polymorphisms can be in complete LD and  as a consequence  several polymorphisms other than the causative mutation may be concordant with the QTL. The concordance analysis seemed to be able to distinguish between parts of the genome with high levels of LD. For example  the blocks that contained concordant polymorphisms for QTL 15 were in complete LD with each other. Although they were almost in complete LD (99%) with the blocks in between  concordant polymorphisms were only found in the blocks that were in complete LD with each other. This suggests that with a sufficient number of sequences  concordance analysis can distinguish between polymorphisms that are in high but incomplete LD. Since both status prediction and sequencing data can contain errors  we allowed for some non-concordant animals. The threshold of allowed non-concordant individuals was set arbitrarily to 10%. When this threshold was reduced  the number of concordant polymorphisms decreased. This decrease was much greater for QTL with more than two clusters than for QTL with two clusters. For the latter QTL  a lower number of comparisons could be made because the QTL status of the middle group was unknown. Concordant polymorphisms for QTL 4 were intergenic or located in the genes  and . In humans  mutations in  cause the Cohen syndrome  for which symptoms include mental retardation  facial dysmorphism  microcephaly  retinal dystrophy  truncal obesity  joint laxity and intermittent neutropenia[]. In mice   is involved in craniofacial  limb and kidney development[]  palatal growth and patterning[]  and synovial joint formation[]. Its role in limb development makes it a good candidate gene for RLSV. All concordant polymorphisms for QTL 6 were located in the  gene  which is expressed in the skeletal muscle  heart  liver and pancreas in mice[]. In mice  effects attributed to a mutation in this gene include a dwarf phenotype  caused by reduced chondrocyte proliferation  inhibition of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and a delay in the formation of primary and secondary ossification centres[]. Only eight polymorphisms were concordant with QTL 9  of which one was located downstream of a microRNA and seven were in introns of the  gene  an RNA editing gene associated with longevity in both humans and []. Although RLSV is correlated with longevity in cattle[] and several of the QTL regions did show peaks in <U+2211>p for longevity  this is not the case for QTL 9. Concordant polymorphisms for QTL 11 were intergenic  except for three polymorphisms that were located in the downstream region of the 5S rRNA  a part of the ribosome that is required for normal translation in most ribosomes but with no known precise function[]. For the QTL with two clusters  the largest number of concordant polymorphisms was found for QTL 15  i.e. 340  of which 115 were intergenic variants  197 were in introns of the  gene  27 were upstream variants of this gene and one was an upstream variant of the  gene. In mice  mutations in the  gene are reported to affect spermatogenesis[]  mammary gland development[]  tumorigenesis[] and retinal development[]. Both [  ] and [] have been associated with split-hand/split-foot malformations in humans. Furthermore   is involved in limb development in mice[  ]  thus it is a good candidate gene for a QTL involved in bovine leg conformation. In addition  in mice the gene  is reported to play a role in neural tube development[]  heart development[]  and central respiratory rhythmogenesis[]. Thus  a wide range of effects have been identified for mutations in these genes in humans and mice. Interestingly  the QTL region detected for RLSV also affected a large number of other traits in dairy cattle  including longevity  confirmation  milk production  clinical mastitis and temperament. All concordant polymorphisms of QTL 19 were located in introns of the  gene. In mice  mutations in  result in chondrodysplasia  which is characterized by various skeletal defects[–]  including a rotated distal portion of the hind limbs[]. Other reported effects in mice relate to tendon development[]  myocardial morphogenesis  and heart valve development[]. Furthermore  mutations in the gene  have been associated with Marshall[] and Stickler[] syndromes in humans  which include skeletal abnormalities. Thus  with skeletal effects in both humans and mice   is a good candidate gene for a QTL involved in RSLV. For most of the QTL for which the status prediction resulted in more than two clusters  the concordance analysis resulted in concordant polymorphisms in a large number of genes. Only for QTL 7 and 17  did the concordance analysis narrow the regions down to specific genes. Concordant polymorphisms for QTL 7 were either intergenic  or located in a 5S rRNA gene or in the  gene. Molecular functions attributed to  include DNA binding and RNA binding[]. For QTL 17  concordant polymorphisms were intergenic  located in the downstream region of a pseudogene  or intronic variants of the  and  genes. In mice  reduced expression of  results in developmental anomalies of the skeleton and brain[]. In humans   has been associated with Ohdo syndrome for which symptoms include skeletal  facial  cardiac and dental abnormalities[] and with genitopatellar syndrome[]  a skeletal dysplasia. In mice  mutations in the  gene cause cerebellar dysfunction  abnormal locomotion  and deficient motor coordination[]. QTL 17 is also associated with locomotion. Concordant polymorphisms for QTL 1 were present in 12 genes  including 15 intronic variants of the  gene  which is involved in cartilage and bone formation[]. Six genes with polymorphisms concordant with QTL 3 were identified. Of these six genes   is known to cause muscle weakness in mice[] and humans[]. The known functions of the eight genes that contained concordant polymorphisms for QTL 13 are not clearly related to RLSV  except for   which is associated with Kleefstra syndrome in humans[]. Although limb abnormalities are not part of the main characteristics of this syndrome  they are present in some patients[]. Concordant polymorphisms were mainly located in the non-coding regions of the genome. This is also the case for the majority of disease- and trait-associated variants identified in human GWAS and it has been suggested that such non-coding variants are involved in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms[]. We were able to perform concordance analysis for 15 of the 20 regions that were most likely to contain QTL for RLSV. For those regions  we could reduce the number of candidate mutations. For some QTL  the concordant analyses narrowed the identified region down to a limited number of genes. Some of these genes are known for their role in limb development  skeletal development in humans and mice  or other effects related to RLSV. Thus  mutations in these genes are good candidates for QTN that affect RLSV.

Group housing is advantageous from a production perspective  but can lead to aggression between animals and thus raises a welfare issue. Bite marks on the animals are an indicator of this aggressive behaviour and thus selection against frequency of bite marks should reduce aggression and improve animal welfare. Bite marks on one individual reflect the aggression of its group members  which means that the number of bite marks carried by one individual depends on the behaviour of other individuals and that it may have a genetic basis. Thus  for a successful breeding strategy it could be crucial to consider both direct (DGE) and indirect (IGE) genetic effects on this trait. However  to date no study has investigated the genetic basis of bite marks in mink.Result and discussionA model that included DGE and IGE fitted the data significantly better than a model with DGE only  and IGE contributed a substantial proportion of the heritable variation available for response to selection. In the model with IGE  the total heritable variation expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance (T) was six times greater than classical heritability ().

The genetic correlation between direct and indirect effects ranged from 0.55 for neck bite marks to 0.99 for tail bite marks. This positive correlation suggests that mink have a tendency to fight in a reciprocal way (giving and receiving bites) and thus  a genotype that confers a tendency to bite other individuals can also cause its bearer to receive more bites.ConclusionBoth direct and indirect genetic effects contribute to variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink.

Group housing is advantageous from a production perspective  but can lead to aggression between animals and thus raises a welfare issue. Bite marks on the animals are an indicator of this aggressive behaviour and thus selection against frequency of bite marks should reduce aggression and improve animal welfare. Bite marks on one individual reflect the aggression of its group members  which means that the number of bite marks carried by one individual depends on the behaviour of other individuals and that it may have a genetic basis. Thus  for a successful breeding strategy it could be crucial to consider both direct (DGE) and indirect (IGE) genetic effects on this trait. However  to date no study has investigated the genetic basis of bite marks in mink. A model that included DGE and IGE fitted the data significantly better than a model with DGE only  and IGE contributed a substantial proportion of the heritable variation available for response to selection. In the model with IGE  the total heritable variation expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance (T) was six times greater than classical heritability (). For instance  for total bite marks  T was equal to 0.61  while  was equal to 0.10. The genetic correlation between direct and indirect effects ranged from 0.55 for neck bite marks to 0.99 for tail bite marks. This positive correlation suggests that mink have a tendency to fight in a reciprocal way (giving and receiving bites) and thus  a genotype that confers a tendency to bite other individuals can also cause its bearer to receive more bites. Both direct and indirect genetic effects contribute to variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink. Thus  a genetic selection design that includes both direct genetic and indirect genetic effects could reduce the frequency of bite marks and probably aggression behaviour in group-housed mink. Social interactions among individuals are common both in plants and animals [] and can have significant effects on production and welfare traits. For example  social interactions can affect feed intake and growth rate in domestic pigs [  ]  lead to mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens []  result in aggression and tail biting if mixing is carried out in pigs []  increase competition in fish []  affect growth rate and disease traits in forestry [–]  and result in bite marks in mink [–]. Because social interactions may have a heritable component  selection acting on these interactions may affect significantly response to artificial selection [–]. Therefore  social interactions are a key factor when designing artificial breeding programmes in domestic animals for which group housing is common practise []. Results have shown that social interactions among individuals may create additional heritable variation []. Ellen et al. [] found that  in laying hens  total heritable variation in survival days  expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance  was 1.5 to 3-fold greater than the variance of the direct genetic effect (DGE). Wilson et al. [] reported that indirect genetic effects (IGE) increased total heritable variation  expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance  from 0.01 to 0.6 for rearing rate and 0.05 to 0.56 for reciprocal latency rate. These results indicate that more than 80% of the heritable variation of these behavioural traits is due to social interactions []. Therefore  for socially affected traits  the heritable variation due to social interactions can be a significant source of heritable variation in domestic  natural  and laboratory populations  for both behavioural traits and production traits [      ] and taking such interactions into account may reveal that their genetic variation is significantly greater than previously thought. However  if these interactions are competitive  the heritable variation may be significantly reduced  even to a value of zero when the direct-indirect genetic correlation equals -1 [  ]. The negative covariance between direct and indirect genetic effect cancels both the direct and indirect genetic effects [  ]. With the exception of maternal genetic effects  breeders have focused on improving the direct effect of the genotype of the individual on its own phenotype []. Hence  the traditional genetic model does not include the social effect of an individual on the phenotypes of its group mates  the so-called Indirect Genetic Effect (IGE; [  ]). Ignoring IGE may result in a suboptimal response to selection and even a negative response to selection for socially affected traits []. For example  individual selection to increase the size of flour beetles populations () decreased the population size in the next generations []. Similarly  in non-beak-trimmed laying hens  selection of the survivors decreased survival rate in the next generations []. Thus  inclusion of IGE is vital to obtain an optimal response to selection for socially affected traits  which means that the traditional quantitative genetic model should be extended to include the heritable effect of an individual on the phenotypes of its group mates [–]. One way of using IGE for response to selection is group selection. It was shown that group selection was effective compared to individual mass selection in decreasing the mortality rate of laying hens  mainly due to aggression  from 68% in generation 2 to 9% in generation 6 [] and in improving longevity of layers []. Another example is the positive response for low leaf and high leaf area in  obtained with group selection versus the negative response with individual selection []. The reason for the effectiveness of group selection is that it takes into account part of the IGE. Although group selection is effective in reducing mortality in chickens and increasing growth in   it uses only the between-group genetic variance and completely ignores the within-group variance. Thus  group selection is efficient only when group members are sufficiently related [    ]. Moreover  using group selection does not provide any insight into the relative importance of direct  indirect genetic effects. It is important to understand the genetic parameters that underlie the interactions because it would help to quantify the potential contribution of IGE to response to selection  to estimate breeding values for both direct and indirect genetic effects  and to optimize breeding programmes []. This can be achieved by a BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) model that separates DGE and IGE and gives weights to each of them according to the variance covariance structure of the genetic parameters [  –]. IGE are increasingly important in European mink production because of changes in the housing system from pair-wise to group housing that is becoming more and more frequent. In the wild  juvenile mink leave the mother’s territory at the age of three to four months in order to find their own territory [  ] and by the end of the growth season  their territorial behaviour is fully developed. This process of dispersal involves increased aggression between the dam and the juveniles as well as between juveniles. The male territory may overlap that of several females but is defended against mink of the same sex [  ]. Therefore  in Europe during the growth season  juvenile mink are traditionally housed in pairs of one male and one female per cage. In spite of their territorial nature  recommendations on cage sizes for group housing of mink were adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999 []  probably because welfare improvements were expected from ‘social enrichment’ as discussed in []. Group housing has become more and more common because it increases the stocking density in the cages and thereby decreases housing investments. Group housing also increases the social dynamics of the environment which could be a potential disadvantage  since studies on animal welfare in group housing report increased aggression resulting in more bite wounds and bite marks [      ]. Direct observation of aggression is time-consuming and it is difficult to distinguish between aggressions and play in mink [  ]. Thus  it is not a feasible option for collecting the required data for breeding against aggressive behaviours in mink. An alternative solution could be to record the consequences of aggressive behaviours  such as bite marks. Bite marks are the result of a hard pressure to the skin  e.g. a bite  during the 7-week growth phase of the winter coat [] and  as such  are an excellent indicator of aggression accumulated over this period  and of reduced animal welfare [    ]. In mink  bite marks can occur anywhere on the body and are often scored on the neck  tail and all the body without neck and tail (referred to as “body” in the following)  in order to quantify different types of aggressive interactions [  ]. If inflicting bite marks is a genetically inherited behaviour  then genetic selection that includes both DGE and IGE may be an efficient way to reduce bite marks in group-housed mink. To date  no studies have quantified direct and indirect genetic variation for the number of bite marks in mink. In this study  we tested the hypothesis that the number of bite marks on different parts of the body is affected by both DGE and IGE. Towards this aim  we estimated the direct and indirect additive genetic (co)variances for the number of bite marks on different regions of the body. Genetic correlations between the numbers of bite marks on different parts of the body were also estimated. Furthermore  we tested whether DGE and IGE on the bite marks in different parts of the body were related to the individual’s body weight  since body weight can be an indicator of social dominance. For instance  a positive genetic correlation between body weight and IGE on bite mark number could indicate that individuals with a dominant genotype for higher weight inflict more bite marks on group mates. The consequences of aggressive behaviour in mink () can be recorded by visual observation of injuries i.e. scars on the skin of live animals or dead bodies at pelting  or by the number of bite marks on the flesh side of the skin just after fleshing during the pelting process. The number of bite marks gives an indication of the number of aggressions received by the individual over a period of time prior to pelting. We used bite marks recorded at pelting as an indirect measure of aggressive behaviour. Bite marks were recorded just after fleshing and after scraping and brushing off sawdust. In 2009  a selection experiment was initiated to select for reduced number of bite marks at pelting  at the mink farm at the Research Centre Foulum in Denmark. We analysed data from the first three generations of that selection experiment. A total of 1985 mink descending from 136 sires and 349 dams were used. Two weeks after weaning i.e. at around 10 weeks post-partum  the juveniles were separated into groups composed of four juvenile mink. Each group of two male siblings and two female siblings was placed in a two storey cage. These procedures were applied in 2009 and repeated in 2010 and 2011. The female siblings were unrelated to the male siblings within a cage except for the 2009 data set  but most individuals had siblings present in other cages. In some cases  data from only three or two mink was obtained mainly because of lack of pedigree information or loss of ID tags during the pelting procedure  and in few cases because of injury or death. Overall  useful data was recorded for two mink from 208 pens  for three mink from 87 pens and all four mink from 327 pens. Individuals were pelted in November 2009  December 2010 and December 2011. At pelting  the number of bite marks on the skin side of the pelt was recorded. The number of bite marks was subjectively measured based on the scale described in Table   and expressed as a bite mark score (BMS). From each litter  siblings of the group-housed juveniles were kept in pairs and were the selection candidates. Parents for the next generation were selected from the candidates based on the number of bite marks in their group-housed litter mates. Each individual was selected based on the performance of the mean phenotype of the litter mates’ pen. Thus  the selection method takes into account both DGE and IGE. The number of bite marks was scored on the neck (from the nose tip to the shoulder/front leg)  body (from the shoulder  including the front legs  to 10 cm above the base of the tail) and tail (from 10 cm above the base of the tail  including the hind legs). A total score was computed as the sum of these three scores. As shown on the histogram in Figure   the data were not normally distributed. Log transformation after adding 100 to each observation improved the normality slightly  as illustrated by skewness and kurtosis before and after transformation (Figure ). Table  summarizes BMS per sex for the different parts of the body.  Residuals come from a model <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>  where fixed effects in  are identical to those used in the mixed model that is explained in the text; since total BMS is the sum of BMS on the three body regions  it ranges from 0 to 27 (see Table ); for the male and female populations  skewness for total BMS corrected for fixed effects was equal to 1.67 and 1.12  respectively and kurtosis was equal to 4.14 and 1.43  respectively.  Residuals come from the model <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>+<U+2009>  where fixed effects in  are identical to those used in the mixed model explained in the text; since total BMS is the sum of BMS on the three body regions  it ranges from 0 to 27 (see Table )  for the male and female populations  skewness for total BMS corrected for fixed effects was equal to 1.54 and 0.96  respectively and kurtosis was equal to 3.1 and 0.43  respectively; the transformation was <U+2009>=<U+2009>ln(<U+2009>+<U+2009>100). Data on BMS and weight were analysed using the GLM procedure in R []. This programme was used to decide which fixed effects should be included in the model to estimate the genetic parameters. The following fixed effects i.e. year  sex  number of individuals in a cage (group size; fitted as a factor)  and the linear regression on the proportion of male mates per cage (i.e.  a covariate  referred to as social sex ratio) were included in the model. Genetic parameters were estimated using residual maximum likelihood with an animal model [  ]. Six models were compared with different combinations of random effects. All six models included the DGE of the individual on which the BMS was recorded. The first three models did not include IGE. The first model fitted cage as a random effect  while the second model fitted sex within cage (cage*sex) as a random effect. The reason for fitting cage*sex as a non-genetic random effect  was to test whether social interactions in mink depend on sex. This hypothesis is based on the fact that male mink are usually larger than female mink and thus aggression could occur mainly between cage mates of the same sex. The third model included a cage plus cage*sex random effect. Each of these three models was extended with IGE  giving a total of six models. The best model was selected based on its Akaike information criterion (AIC). In all six models  we used the same fixed effects (see above). Non-genetic maternal effects (common litter effects) were not significant for BMS  and thus were not included in the models. Based on AIC  non-genetic maternal effects were included in the model for body weight. In this section  we present only the most complete model; in the simpler models the relevant terms were omitted. However  we will present results for the two models that had the highest likelihood i.e. one in which IGE were ignored and one in which IGE were included. The most complete model (referred to as Model 6; see Table ) was: where  is a vector of observed BMS;  is a vector of fixed effects  with the incidence matrix  linking observations to fixed effects   and  are known incidence matrices for direct DGE and IGE  and  and  are vectors of random DGE and IGE  with  indicates the Kronecker product  and  is the numerator relationship matrix [  ].  is a vector of random cage effects and  the incidence matrix linking records to cages  with   where  is an identity matrix of appropriate dimension and  is the cage variance  <U+2009>*<U+2009> a vector of random cage*sex effects and  an incidence matrix  with   where  is an identity matrix of appropriate dimension and  is the variance of the cage*sex effect  and  is a vector of residuals. We fitted different residual variances for male and female individuals  where  is the vector of residuals for males  and  the vector of residuals for females  and  and  are the corresponding variances. In Model 6  the  accounts for heritable indirect effects  and  and <U+2009>*<U+2009> account for covariances among cage mates due to non-heritable indirect effects [  ]. Genetic parameters for BMS were estimated by implementing the above-mentioned linear animal models in the ASReml software []. The matrix of additive genetic relationships  was calculated using information on five generations of pedigree that included 2806 animals. Bivariate analysis was also used to estimate the genetic correlation between bite marks on each part of the body  and to estimate the genetic correlation between bite marks and body weight. The above model yields estimates of three genetic parameters     and . Following Bijma []  these three parameters can be combined into a measure of the total heritable variance that determines the potential of the trait to respond to selection. Since each individual interacts with n-1 group mates  the total heritable impact of an individual’s genes on trait values in the population equals: where   represents the total breeding value  which is a generalization of the traditional breeding value to account for IGE. The total heritable variance is the variance of the total breeding values among individuals  The  expresses the heritable variance in absolute units as the additive genetic variance in classical models. The interpretation of  becomes easier by expressing heritable variance relative to phenotypic variance  similarly to the classical heritability []: A comparison of  reveals the proportion of the contribution of IGE to the heritable variance that determined the potential of the population to respond to selection. Table  shows the estimated fixed effects and their statistical significance. The fixed effect year was significant for bite marks on all regions of the body i.e. neck  body  and tail . Sex and social sex ratio were also significant for bite marks on the neck and tail but not on body and group size was significant only for bite marks on the neck. Table  (see above) shows the log-likelihood values and AIC for all Models 1 through 6. Based on AIC  the best model among the six tested is Model 5 for bite marks on all regions except body for which Model 4 is slightly better. AIC values show that  in spite of the relatively small dataset  models that included IGE were substantially better than those that did not (Models 1 to 3 . 4 to 6). Thus  IGE contribute to the heritable variation of BMS on all locations of the body. Models with a random cage*sex effect were the best based on AIC  but differences in AIC between Models 4 to 6 were very small. Table  shows the estimated variance components obtained with the classical model that included direct genetic effects only  but accounted for both cage and cage*sex as non-genetic random effects (Model 3). The genetic parameters were assumed to be the same in both sexes. The additive genetic variance ranged from 0.78 for neck bite marks to 1.15 for tail bite marks. Heritability ranged from 0.18 to 0.23  and differed significantly from zero. We found no common maternal effects for BMS. Non-genetic variances of BMS were higher in females than in males  which agrees with the observation that the mean BMS for females was closer to the middle of the scale used for BMS (Tables  and ). The estimated heritability for body weight was equal to 0.58. We found a non-significant () common maternal environment effect for body weight. Although the effect is non-significant  it improved the fit of the model for body weight. The cage variance was significantly different from zero for bite marks on all regions of the body. (This conclusion is based on the ratio of the estimate and its SE (standard error)  which was much greater than 2). Although the cage*sex-effect was not significantly different from zero for all regions of the body  it was included in the model because it improved the AIC (Table ). Thus  both cage and cage*sex effects improved the AIC when IGE were ignored. Table  shows the estimated variance components obtained with Model 5 that includes both DGE and IGE and the cage*sex effect. The standard errors on the estimated genetic variances show that both DGE and IGE contributed to variation in BMS. IGE were significantly different from zero for bite marks on all regions of the body and variance of IGE ranged from 0.14 for tail bite marks to 0.27 for body bite marks. The total heritable variation for BMS ranged from 2 to 3.7  and was significantly higher than the additive genetic variance obtained with the traditional model. The total heritable variation expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance ranged from 0.41 to 0.61  and was ~6 times greater than the direct heritability. The correlation between DGE and IGE of BMS ranged from 0.55 to 0.99 in all parts of the body. Comparison of heritability estimates in Tables  and  ( and ) indicates that ordinary heritability estimated with the traditional model overestimates the importance of direct effects by a factor of ~2. In the traditional model  presence of IGE biases the estimate of additive genetic variance upwards. This occurs because cage mates are partly related and thus  an individual receives an IGE from its cage mates that is similar to its own IGE. This in turn increases the covariance between relatives in different cages  which biases heritability upwards []. Table  shows the genetic correlations between BMS on different regions of the body and body weight. Genetic correlations were positive for all bite mark correlations (direct-direct  direct-indirect  and indirect-indirect). Since the bivariate analysis of total BMS with BMS at specific regions of the body failed to converge  total BMS was removed from Table . However  there were small negative genetic correlations between direct effects on BMS and body weight  and between indirect effects on BMS and body weight  some of which were significantly different from zero. Hence  there is a weak indication that heavier individuals are less likely to get involved in aggressive interactions. We have provided evidence that BMS is a heritable trait  and thus can be changed by selective breeding. We found that both DGE and IGE contribute to genetic variation of BMS on all regions of the body. IGE contributed a significant proportion of the heritable variation available for response to selection (). The contribution of IGE variance to total heritable variation  measured by the ratio   ranged from 30% for tail bite marks to 52% for neck bite marks  while that of DGE variance was about 16% for all regions of the body. Moreover  there was a strong positive correlation between DGE and IGE  which further increased total heritable variance. Thus  most of the heritable variation in BMS relates to IGE. For instance  for total BMS  the variance in IGE and the direct-indirect genetic covariance together contributed 85% of the heritable variation. Estimated genetic correlations between direct and indirect genetic effects were strong and positive and ranged from 0.55 to 0.99  i.e. significantly different from zero  except for bite marks in the neck region. Thus  these results suggest that if a genotype causes an individual to bite more  it also leads the individual to be more bitten  which  in turn  suggests that an individual benefits from not harming others. Regarding the non-genetic random effects  the cage*sex effect fitted the data better than the cage effect (except for Body BMS). Ignoring cage*sex effects may cause bias in the estimates of the genetic parameter  which has been reported in previous studies using both simulated [] and real data []. Without fitting cage*sex effects  the estimated variance in both the DGE and the IGE was about 7% lower in our data  indicating a minor effect. This makes sense since the cage*sex effect was not very significantly different from zero. Both cage and cage*sex effects improved the AIC of the traditional model (Model 3). In contrast  when IGE were included in the model  cage effect did not improve the fit of the model. This suggests that IGE are included in the cage variance when they are not accounted for. We included a cage*sex random effect to allow for stronger interactions between individuals of the same sex within a cage (this was expected based on knowledge of behaviour in mink) [–]. Such within-sex interactions might lead to systematic similarities or dissimilarities between cage mates of the same sex. Although we fitted cage and cage*sex as covariances  the results are presented as non-genetic correlations between cage mates and between cage mates of the same sex  for ease of interpretation. The cage*sex correlation was close to zero for all parts of the body (Table ). This result indicates that the non-genetic direct-indirect correlation is close to zero  since the expected value of  is calculated as: where  is the covariance between direct and indirect non-genetic effects   is the direct environmental variance   is the indirect environmental variance   is the number of individuals in a cage  and  is the number of individuals of the same sex in a cage  which on average was equal to 2 in our data. Thus  in contrast to the clearly positive direct-indirect genetic correlation (  Table )  the non-genetic direct-indirect correlation was practically zero. Given the strong positive direct-indirect genetic correlation  it is surprising that the non-genetic direct-indirect correlation is near zero. However  in our data  group mates of the same sex were full sibs. Thus  the cage*sex correlation not only represents the non-genetic correlation between group mates of the same sex  but also between full sibs and those correlations are fully confounded in our data. The kin selection theory predicts that sibs show less competitive interactions []  which agrees with observations reported for pigs  where members of the same family fight less compared to unrelated individuals [  ]. Hence  the apparent difference between the genetic and non-genetic correlations between direct and indirect effects may be due to the fact that information on the non-genetic correlation depends completely on interactions between siblings in our data. The estimated direct-indirect genetic correlation  in contrast  includes interactions among non-kin. By including the cage*sex correlation  we have  at least partly  accounted for non-genetic-indirect effects that depend on relatedness. However  the indirect genetic effects may also differ between kin and non-kin. Hence  estimated parameters for DGE and IGE may depend on group composition with respect to relatedness. This has proven to be a complex issue that we will explore in a future study. The direct-direct genetic correlations for BMS on different regions of the body were positive (Table )  which suggests that an individual that is less bitten on one part of its body is also likely to be less bitten on the other parts of its body. The direct-indirect genetic correlations for BMS on different regions of the body were also positive  which indicates that an individual that is less bitten on one part of its body is less likely to bite other parts of the body of its cage mates. Finally  the indirect-indirect genetic correlations for BMS were also positive  which implies that an individual that bites more or less one part of the body of its cage mates will also bite more or less the other parts of the body of its cage mates. We also investigated the genetic correlations between weight and direct and indirect effects on BMS  but found no significant correlations. Thus  selecting for increased size (larger pelts) animals  which implies increased weight  is not expected to lead to more biting. Our findings suggest that it is possible to select mink that have a considerably lower level of biting. Irrespective of the selection strategy  response to selection is always equal to the product of the intensity of selection  the accuracy of selection  and the standard deviation of total heritable variation  []. For instance  for total BMS   is equal to 4.36 and the mean of total BMS is equal to 6.47  which means that the current total level is only 1.48 genetic standard deviation away from zero. Even with a low accuracy and a moderate intensity  we can produce mink that have a significantly lower level of biting. For instance  with mass selection for total bite marks  which would require recording BMS on live animals  the accuracy is [] which equals ~0.4 based on our estimates. Then  if 10% of the population is used for breeding to have an intensity of selection equal to 1.76  the predicted response to selection will be equal to ~3.07 and the total BMS is predicted to reduce from ~6.47 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>3.4  which is a very substantial reduction in a single generation of selection. When using group selection for groups of four sibs  two males and two females that all belong to the same family  it is possible to reach an even higher accuracy i.e. ~ 0.65  and thus the predicted response to selection will be ~5. Using sib selection  which is more appropriate for bite marks since they are recorded on the pelts of dead individuals  the predicted accuracy will be equal to<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.54 and the response to selection to ~4.14. Thus  total BMS will be reduced from ~6.47 to<U+2009>~<U+2009>3.33  again a very substantial reduction in a single generation of selection. In 2011  on average  the difference in total BMS between the selected and control lines was 4.5 in both sexes  which is in reasonable agreement with the range of predicted responses. Thus  although in practice response to selection is usually lower than the theoretical predicted value  our results indicate that it is possible to select mink that have a considerably lower level of biting in a few generations. In summary  we confirm the hypothesis that both DGE and IGE contribute to variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink. Since IGE contribute a substantial amount of heritable variation  genetic selection can reduce bite marks and possibly aggressive behaviour in group-housed minks. Including IGE in selection designs would ensure a more efficient selection against bite marks. Frank SA: All of life is social. Curr Biol. 2007  17: R650-10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.003.

The pathway approach used here allowed us to identify some novel candidates for further studies that will be aimed at refining the location of associated genomic regions and identifying polymorphisms contributing to variation in lactation volume and milk composition. There have been many attempts to identify the genes that control milk production and functional traits in dairy cattle since they have high economic value [  ]. Linkage studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of a handful of causative mutations that affect milk production traits in dairy cattle [–]. However  the mutations that underlie most of the genetic variation remain elusive  reflecting the fact that the majority of these mutations are likely to have small effects and  therefore  individually explain a small proportion of the genetic variance [  ]. New methods are needed to analyse the large quantity of genetic information provided by high-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) panels in order to identify novel genetic variants that have a functional role in lactation traits. One potential approach is to first filter genetic variants for association analysis by considering pathways of genes that are likely to be involved in lactation. The advantage of this method is that less stringent significance thresholds can be used than in traditional GWAS  since the level of multiple testing is not as high. This also means that associations of smaller effect can be detected. However  the approach does have the limitation that any mutations that affect the traits outside the selected pathways will be missed  which means that the variation we can identify may be reduced compared with that from whole-genome studies. For dairy traits  genes that are involved in mammary gland development  prolactin signalling and involution pathways are relevant candidates. Genes in the lactation pathway have been well-described but are largely inferred from mouse studies [–]. Development of the mammary gland (or mammogenesis) involves the formation of the rudimentary mammary structure before puberty and is triggered by secreted signalling proteins and transcription factors that regulate developmental processes  such as the Wnt  notch and hedgehog signalling pathways []. When the mammary structure begins to form  genes for growth hormone and proteins involved in basement membrane architecture are expressed. At puberty  the concentration of several hormones increases and stimulates the formation of alveolar buds []. Prolactin signalling is vital for lobulo-alveolar development and establishment of lactation but appears less important after teat formation in dairy cattle [  ]. One hypothesis is that in cattle  prolactin may be more important for immune support at calving []. Prolactin interacts with its receptors to trigger paracrine signalling mechanisms through a highly regulated feedback mechanism involving JAK/STAT and map kinase activity  as well as other downstream targets  which in turn regulate proliferation and cell differentiation []. In involution  milk producing epithelial cells are removed via cell detachment and apoptosis. Cytokines  interleukins and MMP (matrix metalloproteinases) are involved in complex signal transduction cascades to regulate proliferation and apoptosis in this pathway. The mammary epithelium undergoes several rounds of proliferation  differentiation and apoptosis over up to eight lactations in dairy cattle []. These processes are regulated by a number of genes  which represent excellent candidates for harbouring mutations that explain part of the observed variation in milk production traits and thus link genetic variation with the biological mechanisms underlying the phenotype. In this study  we have assembled sets of genes involved in mammary gland development  prolactin and involution biological pathways. Then  we tested SNPs in windows of 200 kb surrounding these genes for association with milk production traits in dairy cattle. Our hypothesis is that genes in these pathways will harbour genetic mutations that explain variation in production traits in dairy cattle  and that our approach will detect more of these associations than a traditional GWAS  since we can test variants at lower significance thresholds because of the smaller number of tests conducted. To determine whether SNPs within key lactation pathways were significant for milk production traits  an association analysis was used. We analysed several traits  including fat kg  fat percentage  milk volume  protein kg  and protein percentage [  ]. A total of 16 812 dairy cattle were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine HD BeadChip  or the BovineSNP50 array [] and imputed to the higher density [] (1785 animals were actually genotyped at the higher density). After quality control (as in [])  the final number of SNPs was 632 003. The genotyped animals included 9015 Holstein cows  2770 Holstein bulls  4202 Jersey cows  and 825 Jersey bulls [see Additional file : Table S1]. Phenotypes of bulls and cows were constructed as daughter trait deviations (the average of the bull’s daughters trait deviations corrected for breed of mate) and trait deviations  respectively (corrected for herd year season and permanent environment effects) [see Additional file : Table S2]. The distributions of the number of lactations (for cows) and daughters (for bulls) are in Additional file : Figure S1. Records were standardised in both breeds to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. In all analyses  phenotypes on bulls were weighted as where  represents the number of records [] and  is the heritability of the trait (0.33 for milk volume  fat kg and protein kg  and 0.5 for protein percentage and fat percentage  for both breeds []). Phenotypes on cows were weighted using the formula []: where  is the repeatability (0.56 for all milk production traits) and  is the number of lactations. For the percentage traits  we were not able to fit weights for bulls in the model due to problems with convergence  likely because the heritability for these traits was high. The linear mixed model used to determine the association between individual SNP and each milk production trait: where  is the vector of phenotypes  expressed as the trait deviations for cows and daughter trait averages for bulls   is the vector of fixed effects  including the overall mean and the effects of breed and sex   is a design matrix allocating phenotypes to fixed effects   is the vector of animal genotypes (the number of copies of the second allele at the SNP that the animal carries  coded as 0  1 or 2)  b is the additive effect of the second allele of the SNP   is an incidence matrix mapping phenotype to animals   is the vector of polygenic effects (one for each animal)  and  is the vector of random residuals. The polygenic breeding values were fitted as random effects following a normal distribution  where  is the expected relationship among individuals constructed from the pedigree (which dates back to the 1940s) and  is the polygenic genetic variance. Variance components and fixed effects were estimated for each SNP with ASReml []. Gene sets for analysis were chosen using published reviews of three important developmental stages of the lactating mammary gland. These included the mammary development pathway [] and the prolactin signalling [] and involution pathways []. We identified 64 genes involved in mammary development  27 genes involved in prolactin signalling  and 40 genes involved in involution (Tables    and ). The gene families    and  were not included in the pathways since specific genes were not suggested in the reviews and these gene families have a wide range of signalling functions. The genomic location of these genes were determined using UMD3.1 in the NCBI database []. The SNPs within the genes of a pathway  or within 100 kb to each side of those genes  were then tested for association with each trait using the model above. The effect of a SNP was determined to be significant at P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. The GWAS was repeated using other significance thresholds (P<U+2009><<U+2009>10 and P<U+2009><<U+2009>10) but 0.05 had the greatest power to detect enrichment (results not shown). The number of SNPs significant for each pathway was expressed as a proportion of the total number of SNPs in that pathway (). To determine if the proportion of significant SNPs observed for each pathway was significantly greater than by chance at an experiment-wise level  distributions under the null hypothesis of no association were constructed with random permutations of the data. A list of 24 617 uniquely annotated bovine genes was created from the Ensembl Biomart database [  ]. From this  three sets of genes  each with a length equal to the respective pathway tested were selected at random. SNPs were selected from within and 100 kb surrounding these genes to reflect the moderate to high linkage disequilibrium in Holstein cattle [  ]. Each pathway SNP set was analysed in ASReml using the mixed linear model described above. This procedure was repeated 10 000 times to construct null distributions and the 500th highest proportion of significant SNPs was taken at the experiment-wise P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 threshold. If the observed ratio for a pathway was greater than this value for a particular trait  the pathway was considered significant. To account for differences in functional clustering of genes in the experimental pathways and in the random control gene sets  we compared the distance between genes on the same chromosome [see Additional file : Figure S2]. The experimental and control sets were distributed similarly but  due to the smaller number or paired genes for the experimental pathways  there were fewer gene pairs at long distances across the chromosomes (particularly<U+2009>><U+2009>10 Mb). KEGG annotations were used to determine the gene sets that represented other biological pathways [  ]. Finally  a variance component analysis was used to determine whether the SNPs within each pathway explained a greater proportion of the genetic variance than an equal number of randomly selected SNPs from the whole genome. The model fitted was where terms were the same as above  and  is a vector of random effects  assumed distributed   where  is a genomic relationship matrix  constructed using the rules of []. The genomic relationship matrix was based on the SNPs from each pathway  plus a set of 4000 SNPs randomly selected from the whole genome. The reason for adding the 4000 randomly chosen SNPs was that SNPs in the genes of the pathways are typically clustered by genomic location (i.e. a number of the genes are located in close proximity) [see Additional file : Figure S2]. Given the large number of animals in our dataset  this means that a considerable number of animals can have genomic relationships that are equal to or close to 1  i.e. they have inherited the same segments of the genome at all of the locations of the pathway genes. Consequently  the genomic relationship matrix is singular and impossible to invert. Adding 4000 random SNPs removed the singularities and the genomic relationship matrix could be inverted and variance components estimated. However  with the 4000 SNPs included  we could only assess the marginal contribution of adding SNPs in the pathway. Estimates of the variance components  and  were obtained from the REML analysis with ASREML []. The proportion of variance explained by the SNPs in these pathways was compared to that explained by the same number of randomly chosen SNPs within 100 kb of a gene  i.e. the additional SNPs were chosen to be close to genes  plus the set of 4000 randomly chosen SNPs corresponding to each pathway. Five replicates of the randomly chosen sets were performed to obtain standard errors. The 64 genes identified in the mammary development pathway included 3968 SNPs (Table ). When the proportion of significant SNPs  at P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05  () was compared to the null distributions  the mammary development pathway was significantly associated with protein percentage (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.340  P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01; Table  and Additional file : Figure S3). The null distributions compared with the experimental results are shown in Additional file : Figure S3  Additional file : Figure S4 and Additional file : Figure S5. The genes that contained the largest proportion of significant SNPs (> 50% significant SNPs) were the following:                      and  (Table  and Additional file : Table S3 for gene abbreviations). Four genes in the mammary development pathway were located on BTA20  which contains a well-known QTL for milk production []. These genes included      and  is located 1 Mb downstream of   which is the gene often described with  though not necessarily underlying []  this large QTL. To account for any potential bias associated with over-represented genes  we re-ran the pathway test and control permutations without BTA20. The mammary development pathway still reached significance for protein percentage when this chromosome was removed [see Additional file : Figure S6]. KEGG annotations of these 64 genes found 25 genes in pathways associated with cancer and 8 to 14 other genes in signalling pathways  such as   that are known to be activated during lactation (Table ). The PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in mammary development  and mutations in genes of this pathway are found in approximately 70% of breast cancers []. There were eight genes involved in Wnt signalling pathways  which are prominent in mammary development and cancers []. To determine the extent of pleiotropy for variants in the pathway  we correlated the SNP effect estimates (for the 3968 SNPs in the pathway) for each pair of traits. Milk volume was negatively correlated with fat percentage and protein percentage  while fat percentage and protein percentage were highly positively correlated (Table ). Fat kg and milk volume were also highly positively correlated with protein kg  as expected. The prolactin signalling gene set was considerably smaller (27 genes  1569 SNPs) than the involution and mammary development sets  since it only represents only one signalling pathway  while mammary development and involution represent the combined effects of several sub-pathways (Table ). Protein kg  fat kg and fat percentage were significantly associated with the prolactin signalling gene set (Table ) and [see Additional file : Figure S4]. The          and  genes had more than 50% of SNPs significant for three or more milk production traits (Table ). KEGG annotations for genes in the prolactin pathway showed 12 associations with the JAK-STAT signalling pathway  followed by the PI3K-Akt and insulin signalling pathways (Table ). The involution pathway contained 40 genes and 2521 SNPs (Table ). The proportion of associated SNPs was significant at the experiment-wise level for all milk production traits  except fat [see Additional file : Figure S5] and (Table ). We identified a large ratio of significant SNPs for                and  (Table ). KEGG analysis showed a trend towards infection-related pathways (Table ). JAK-STAT  hepatitis B and PI3K signalling pathways were also highly represented. Traits showed moderate to high correlations  which suggested pleiotropy for milk production traits within SNPs in the involution pathway (Table ). Three genes in the involution pathway were located on BTA14 and may be biased by associations with the large QTL at the beginning of BTA14 associated with the mutation in []. The  and  genes are located more than 13 Mb upstream of this QTL but  sits 2 Mb upstream from   well within the bounds of this very large QTL. When BTA14 was removed from the analysis  the involution pathway remained significant for the traits for which this was tested [see Additional file : Figure S6]. There was some overlap in the genes of the three pathways. Genes    and  were common to all three pathways (Figure ). Prolactin and mammary development pathways showed the largest overlap  which included    and  genes. KEGG analyses showed that similar pathways were represented in mammary development and involution but infection-related pathways were more prominent due to the abundance of acute phase response genes such as  and  genes (Table ).                                                      For milk production traits  SNPs in the involution pathway explained 10 to 13% more genetic variation than expected by chance for all traits (Table ). SNPs in the mammary development pathway explained 7 to 9% more genetic variation than expected by chance for milk  protein percentage and fat percentage. SNPs in the prolactin pathway explained less variation than expected by chance  although results were not significantly different from zero. This could be the result of a combination of two factors  i.e. (1) SNPs within the prolactin signalling pathway do not really explain much variation  and (2) because of the small number of genes in this pathway  the SNPs did not cover all chromosomes (and therefore did not capture variation on those chromosomes)  unlike the randomly sampled SNPs. The overall significance of each milk production trait for each pathway tested was very similar  though not identical  to the results from SNP by SNP association testing (perhaps a result of random sampling to construct the null distributions). We used information on mammary development  prolactin signalling and involution pathways to identify candidate gene regions that could be associated with milk production traits. SNPs in genes that are involved in the mammary development pathway were highly associated with protein percentage and explained a considerable proportion of the variance for three milk production traits. The prolactin signalling pathway did not explain any additional variance in milk production traits  but contained a significant number of associated SNPs for protein kg  protein percentage and fat percentage. SNPs in genes involved in the involution pathway explained the greatest level of variance in milk production traits in our variance component approach. The involution pathway was also significant for all milk production traits except fat in the association testing approach. Mammary development  prolactin signalling and involution pathways contained highly significant genes that have been described in GWAS or are known to be important lactation genes. These include           and the  genes. In particular  SNPs within  have a large effect on milk composition and have been validated [  ]. Figure  shows a GWAS for protein percentage as an example  and displays the relationship between genes studied from these pathways and genome-wide QTL patterns. Most genes are located in regions that could not be identified by a traditional GWAS. SNPs within regions not previously associated with milk production traits  such as         and   which were significant for mammary development  may contain novel mutations that affect milk production traits and may represent key genes from the mammary development pathway that explain some of the variance in these traits in cattle.  SNPs within the mammary development  prolactin signalling  and involution pathways are highlighted as red  blue and green dots  respectively; * identifies chromosomes 14 and 20  which have been scaled down to allow observation of smaller effects. The reason why the involution pathway explained the greatest level of variance in milk production traits in our variance component approach  although only half the number of SNPs of the mammary development pathway were available  could be because this pathway includes genes in or close to a previously described QTL with quite large effects on milk production traits (Figure )  particularly protein percentage []. However  when the analysis was ran without the genes on BTA20 (     and )  this pathway was still significant  even for protein percentage. Note that removing the  gene from the analysis is questionable because the growth hormone receptor is a vital component of the lactation pathway since it interacts with several relevant substrates during lactation []. Similarly  removing the    and  genes on BTA14 (because they were in the region of ) did not affect the overall significance of the mammary development pathway. The clustered expression of the genes in a pathway  i.e. they are expressed with other secreted milk genes []  may result in significant associations that are due to nearby  co-expressed genes. The permutation method generated some replicates with similar genome distributions to the experimental data [see Additional file : Figure S2]  which implies that the clustered expression of genes probably does not greatly affect the results. There is currently no ideal approach to control for the complicated genetic architectures of traits in pathway analyses. While these genetic structures should be accounted for  caution should be taken to avoid losing information from highly relevant genes. One of the main limitations of our approach is that if a mutation that affects milk production is not in the analysed pathways  it will automatically be excluded. Perhaps even more importantly  our interpretations could be biased if irrelevant genes are included in the pathways. This may have occurred in cases where broad-acting cellular processes are represented in the gene sets. Improved descriptions of pathways would increase the power to identify genomic regions that influence these traits. The pathways used in this study were primarily derived from mouse studies and are relatively poorly described in cattle. For mammary development  the signalling interactions in the placode epithelium are particularly poorly described. For the prolactin signalling pathway  little is known about the downstream signalling of progesterone receptors. For the involution pathway  it is not known how membrane apoptosis is triggered although this would represent a significant contribution to the description of this biological process. Approaches such as microarray and RNAseq technologies using time-course data could help refine this method so that it represents more closely the true biological action. These approaches have successfully identified genes acting at different physiological states in the lactation cycle. Another potential limitation of our study is that the phenotypes were averages of several records across lactation. The same analyses could be performed using just early or late lactation records. Lactation curve parameters have been used in similar modelling experiments and may further refine these numerous SNP associations []. Finally  the value of KEGG pathway annotations was questionable. The relevance of these annotations for the target traits is difficult to establish for genes that are involved in broad and numerous biological processes. A further problem is that KEGG annotations are heavily dominated by cancer-related information. We have successfully used the information from characterised mammary development  prolactin signalling and involution pathways to identify novel SNP associations with milk production traits. The proportion of significant SNPs in or near genes from the mammary development pathway was considerably greater than expected by chance for protein percentage. Of the three pathways studied  the involution pathway was highly associated with milk production traits and explained the highest level of variation above that expected by chance (up to 13% for protein kg). While we have reported many novel candidates useful for further studies  we must point out that pathway-based methods are restricted by the quality of annotations and completeness of pathway information.

A QTL (quantitative trait locus) for fatty acid composition in backfat was previously detected on porcine chromosome 8 (SSC8) in an Iberian x Landrace F intercross. More recently  a genome-wide association study detected the same genomic region for muscle fatty acid composition in an Iberian x Landrace backcross population.   a strong positional candidate gene for this QTL  contains a polymorphism in its promoter region ()  which is associated with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic acids in muscle and adipose tissues. Here  a combination of single-marker association and the haplotype-based approach was used to analyze backfat fatty acid composition in 470 animals of an Iberian x Landrace F intercross genotyped with 144 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed along SSC8.ResultsTwo trait-associated SNP regions were identified at 93 Mb and 119 Mb on SSC8. The strongest statistical signals of both regions were observed for palmitoleic acid (C16:1(n-7)) content and C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios.  and  are positional candidate genes in the 93 Mb region and two novel microsatellites in  and nine SNPs in  were identified.

One of the main sources of human-consumed meat is pork  which represents more than 40% of the meat produced worldwide []. The success of pig production is strongly related to improvements in growth and carcass yield. Meat-quality traits are essential for the processing industry and end-consumer acceptance []  and  as a result  these qualitative traits have been the subject of many studies in breeding programs. Fat content and fatty acid (FA) composition in swine are becoming increasingly studied because of their effect on sensory and nutritional quality of meat. They determine important sensory and technological aspects of pork and meat products because of their influence on the melting point and oxidative status of porcine tissues []. In addition  the amount and type of fat in the diet have a major impact on human health. The high consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA) raises plasma LDL-cholesterol  which is a major risk factor for arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) [–]. However  recent studies suggest that individual SFA have different physiological effects. Indeed  lauric acid (12:0)  myristic acid (14:0) and palmitic acid (16:0) raise LDL and HDL cholesterol plasma levels  whereas stearic acid (C18:0) is considered neutral [  ]  although some epidemiologic evidence suggests that stearic acid (C18:0) is associated with CHD []. In contrast  cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are beneficial for human health. PUFA have been shown to protect against CHD []  whereas MUFA are also considered to have a hypocholesterolemic effect [] and  in addition  to have a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity []. A few QTL (quantitative trait loci) for FA composition have been reported on porcine chromosome 8 (SSC8) in F Duroc x Large White []  F White Duroc x Erhualian [] and Duroc [] populations. Using an Iberian x Landrace F intercross (IBMAP) []  a QTL was identified on SSC8 for percentages of palmitic (16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA and for average length of FA in backfat (BF). Recently  a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in a backcross population (BC1_LD; 25% Iberian and 75% Landrace) led to the identification of five genomic regions on SSC8 associated with intramuscular fat in  (IMF) FA composition []. In addition  a study that combined a linkage QTL scan and a GWAS on the same backcross revealed significant pleiotropic regions with effects on palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA in both IMF and BF tissues []. The main goals of this work were: (1) to study the QTL architecture for FA composition on SSC8 in the F generation of the IBMAP cross using a panel of 144 informative SNPs  and (2) to analyze additional positional candidate genes. Animals used in this study belong to the IBMAP experimental population []. Two Iberian (Guadyerbas line) boars were crossed with 30 Landrace sows to generate the F generation. Six F boars were coupled with 67 F sows to obtain 470 F animals. In addition  gene-expression analyses were carried out on 56 females from a backcross (BC1_LD) generated by crossing five F (Iberian x Landrace) boars with 23 Landrace sows. All animals were maintained under intensive conditions and feeding was  with a cereal-based commercial diet. The experiments were performed in Europe following national and institutional guidelines for the ethical use and treatment of animals in experiments. In addition  the protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institution (IRTA Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries). F animals were slaughtered at an average age of 175.5<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.3 days. However  tissues for RNA extraction were not isolated from animals of the F generation. Backcross animals were slaughtered at an average age of 179.8<U+2009>±<U+2009>2.6 days  and samples of liver and adipose tissue were collected  snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of all animals by the phenol-chloroform method  as described elsewhere. The composition of 10 FA in IMF and BF (taken between the third and the fourth ribs) tissues was determined by gas chromatography as described in [    ]. Subsequently  the percentage of each FA  relative to the total FA  was calculated as well as the global percentages of SFA  MUFA  PUFA and related indices  including desaturation and elongation indices. A total of 470 animals were genotyped for 144 SNPs located on SSC8; these include a selection of 142 informative SNPs derived from the Porcine SNP60K BeadChip [] and two SNPs that corresponded to the previously detected polymorphisms in the [] and [] genes. These SNPs [See Additional file : Table S1] were included in a custom-generated panel  genotyped using a Veracode Golden Gate Genotyping Kit (Illumina Inc.) and analyzed with a Bead Xpress Reader (Illumina Inc.). SNP positions were based on the whole-genome sequence assembly 10.2 build of  (). All genotypes were assigned using the GenomeStudio software (Illumina Inc.). Markers that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5% and missing genotypes that had a frequency greater than 5% were removed using PLINK [] software. In total  133 SNPs (92%) passed this quality-threshold filter and were used in the subsequent analysis. Genotypes of all the parents were obtained with the 60 K SNP chip (Illumina) [] or by pyrosequencing [  ]. SNPs    and  were genotyped using the KASP SNP genotyping system platform (). Besides these  two new microsatellites in the  gene were genotyped by PCR amplification and capillary electrophoresis and fluorescent detection using an ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Fifty-six animals of the BC1_LD were genotyped for SNPs  and  and the two  microsatellites for gene-expression studies. In addition  a subset of 168 F animals were genotyped for SNPs    and the two  microsatellites for association studies. All parents and grandparents of these animals were also genotyped in the same way. Association analysis was performed for FA composition and indices of FA metabolism in 470 F animals. A mixed model that accounts for additive effects was performed using Qxpak 5.0 []: where y is the l individual record  sex (two levels) and batch (five levels) are fixed effects  ß is a covariate coefficient with c being carcass weight  <U+03BB> is a -1  0  +1 indicator variable depending on the l individual genotype for the k SNP  a represents the additive effect associated with SNP  u represents the infinitesimal genetic effect treated as random and distributed as N(0   s) where  is a numerator of the kinship matrix and e is the residual. A similar model that fitted different QTL effects was used to test the hypothesis of the presence of two QTL located in the studied regions with effects a and a on the same FA: The R package q-value [] was used to calculate the false-discovery rate (FDR)  and the cut-off of the significant association at the whole-genome level was set at the q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. Version 2.15.2 of R [] was used to calculate the descriptive statistics for the 10 analyzed traits and their related indices. For linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LDLA) analysis  haplotypes were reconstructed using DualPHASE software []  which exploits population (linkage disequilibrium) and family information (Mendelian segregation and linkage) in a Hidden Markov Model setting. Then  QTL fine-mapping was performed for the most significant traits C16:1(n-7)  C18:0/C16:0  C16:1(n-7)/C18:1(n-7)  and the FA average chain-length (ACL) by applying the mixed model: in which  is a vector of fixed effects (sex and batch)   is the vector of random QTL effects corresponding to the K cluster defined by the Hidden State   is the vector of random individual polygenic effects and  is the vector of individual error. Genomic DNA samples from 10 individuals of the BC1_LD and two Iberian boars were used to amplify and sequence the proximal promoter and exon 1 of the  and  genes. A 931-bp region of the  gene was amplified and sequenced in two overlapping fragments of 517 bp and 663 bp. Primers [See Additional file : Table S2] were designed based on a SSC8 sequence of a  mixed breed [ENSSSCG00000009060] available from the  database and conserved with the human  gene [ENSG00000196782]. For the  gene  two overlapping fragments of 473 bp and 478 bp were amplified and sequenced. Primers [See Additional file : Table S2] were designed based on a SSC8 sequence of a  mixed breed [ENSSSCG00000030396] available from the  database and conserved with the human  gene [ENSG00000145391]. All primers were designed using the PRIMER3 software [] and were validated using the PrimerExpress 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). PCR (polymerase chain reactions) were carried out in a total volume of 25 µL containing 0.6 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems)  1.5 to 2.5 mM MgCl depending on the primers [See Additional file : Table S2]  0.2 mM of each dNTP  0.5 µM of each primer and 20 ng of genomic DNA. The temperature profile was 94°C for 10 min and 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min  58°C to 62°C depending on the primers [See Additional file : Table S2] for 1 min and 72°C for 1.5 min  including a final step of 7 min at 72°C. Gradient parameters were determined based on size and GC content of the amplicon. The samples were then analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. Purification was performed using an Exonuclease I and FastAP™ Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase []. For the sequencing reaction  we used the Big Dye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI Prism 3730 DNA analyzer was employed (Applied Biosystems). Polymorphisms were checked through the Seq scape v2.1.1 program (Applied Biosystems). Based on the sequencing results of the promoter region and exon 1 of the  gene  two new microsatellites were identified. Both microsatellites were independently amplified using fluorescent primers [See Additional file : Table S2]. PCR were performed in a 25-µL reaction mix containing 20 ng of genomic DNA  0.2 mM of each dNTP  2.5 mM MgCl  0.5 µM of each PCR primer and 0.6 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). PCR were run as follows: 94°C for 10 min  35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min  58°C for 1 min  72°C for 1.5 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. The two amplicons were mixed at a ratio of 1:3 (HEX:FAM) and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and the ROX-500 GeneScan Size Standard. The peak height of each product was determined using Peak Scanner 2 software (Applied Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from liver and BF tissues using the RiboPure kit (Ambion)  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA was then quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products) and RNA integrity was assessed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer-2100 (Agilent Technologies). One µg of total RNA of each sample was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) in a reaction volume of 20 µL. Fifty-six females of the BC1_LD were used to quantify gene expression. The expression of  and  was analyzed using the 48.48 microfluidic dynamic array IFC chip (Fluidigm) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly  2 µL of 1:5 diluted cDNA was pre-amplified using 2X Taqman PreAmp Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 50 nM of each primer pair in 5-µL reaction volume. The cycling program consisted of an initial step of 10 min at 95°C followed by 16 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 4 min at 60°C. At the end of this pre-amplification step  the reaction products were diluted 1:5 (diluted pre-amplification samples). RT-qPCR on the dynamic array chips was conducted on the BioMarkTM system (Fluidigm). A 5-µL pre-mix sample containing 2.5 µL of SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with Low ROX (Bio-Rad)  0.25 µL of DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm) and 2.25 µL of diluted pre-amplification samples (1:16 or 1:64 from the diluted pre-amplification samples from liver and BF samples  respectively)  as well as a 5-µL assay mix containing 2.5 µL of Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm)  2.25 µL of DNA Suspension Buffer (Teknova) and 0.25 µL of 100 µM primer pairs (500 nM in the final reaction) were mixed inside the chip using the IFC controller MX (Fluidigm). The cycling program consisted of an initial step of 60 s at 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 5 s at 96°C and 20 s at 60°C. A dissociation curve was also drawn for each primer pair. Data were collected using the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR analysis software 3.0.2 (Fluidigm) and analyzed with the DAG expression software 1.0.4.11 [] using standard curves for relative quantification. Relative standard-curves with a four-fold dilutions series (1/4  1/16  1/64  1/256  1/1024) of a pool of 10 cDNA samples were constructed for each gene to extrapolate the value of the quantities of each studied sample. Of the four endogenous genes tested (      )   and  had the most stable expression [] in both tissues. The normalized quantity values of each sample and assay were used to compare our data. PCR primer sequences [See Additional file : Table S2] were designed using PrimerExpress 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Mean values between genotypes were compared using a linear model implemented in R  which performs a single stratum analysis of variance considering sex and batch as fixed effects. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p-value of 0.05. A custom panel of 144 SNPs located on SSC8 was used to genotype 470 F animals. Association analyses for the BF FA composition in the C14:0 to C22:0 ranges were performed with genotypes from a subset of 133 SNPs (call rate<U+2009>><U+2009>0.99). Statistically significant associations were found (Table ) for the SFA myristic (C14:0)  palmitic (C16:0) and stearic acids (C18:0). Among MUFA  palmitoleic acid (C16:1(n-7)) and oleic acid (C18:1(n-9)) were associated  whereas for PUFA only eicosadienoic acid (C20:2(n-6)) was significant. Similarly  the ACL metabolic ratio showed a significant association. A strong association signal was found for the C16:1(n-7)/C16:0 desaturation ratio and two elongation ratios: C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7). Two regions that contain trait-associated SNPs (TAS) were clearly visualized in the association plots at around 93 Mb and 119 Mb for all of the above-mentioned FA and indices with the exception of the C20:2(n-6)/C18:2(n-6) elongation ratio  which showed only one significant TAS region at 120.99 Mb (Table ). For all significant traits  the 119 Mb TAS region showed a stronger signal than the 93 Mb region. The strongest effects of both TAS regions were found for palmitoleic acid (C16:1(n-7)) content and C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios. A combination of linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis (LDLA) was then performed for the most significantly associated traits [See Additional file : Table S3]. With this haplotype-based approach  it is possible to simultaneously exploit linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium. Several studies have shown the usefulness of this strategy for fine-mapping and QTL interval reduction [  ]. The LDLA study identified the two TAS regions by association analysis  with the 119 Mb region showing the strongest statistical signal for all analyzed traits. Figure  shows the two genomic regions identified for the C18:0/C16:0 elongation ratio. Plots of the other three traits analyzed are shown in Additional file : Figure S1.  Plot of association study (red points) and LDLA patterns (blue line) for the stearic/palmitic ratio; the X-axis represents positions in Mb on SSC8  and the Y-axis shows the –log10 (p-value); vertical  the pink line represents the position of the  gene  the blue line represents the position of the  gene and the green line represents the position of the  gene on SSC8; horizontal  dashed lines mark the association study significance level (FDR-based q-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05); positions in Mb are relative to the  assembly of the pig genome. In order to determine whether one or two QTL were segregating on SSC8 for the BF FA and their indices  models fitting one QTL against a model considering two different QTL were tested. Results of the LR test indicated that the model with two QTL was the most likely for the 10 traits analyzed [See Additional file : Table S4]. Previously  a QTL scan for BF FA composition was performed with 369 animals from the same F generation []  but only six microsatellite markers were genotyped. A clear effect of SSC8 markers was observed only for percentages of palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA and ACL. A suggestive effect on percentage of oleic acid (C18:1(n-9)) was also observed. However  the confidence interval for this QTL was greater than 30 cM. Two other studies of our group analyzed positional candidate genes for this QTL  i.e. [] and []  but the localization of the QTL was not refined. In addition  QTL for IMF palmitic (C16:0) FA composition have been reported in a Duroc x Large White F cross [] and for stearic (C18:0) FA in a White Duroc x Erhualian F cross []. A GWAS for IMF FA composition [] with genotypes from the 60 K SNP chip (Illumina) was carried out using 144 animals from a related backcross population (BC1_LD). The strongest signals on SSC8 were observed for the palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA content and the C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) ratio for SNPs ALGA0048684 and SIRI0000509  which in the  assembly are located at 99.2 Mb and 119.7 Mb  respectively. Furthermore  two significant pleiotropic regions (at 93.3 Mb - 99.5 Mb and 110.9 Mb - 126.9 Mb) with effects on palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA in both IMF and BF tissues have been identified in the same backcross []. For palmitic (C16:0) FA  a large (83.8 Mb - 130.6 Mb) chromosomal interval was significant for both BF and IMF []. Here  two QTL at approximately 93 Mb and 119 Mb were detected and affected the BF composition of the six FA and the four indices mentioned above in the 470 F animals. The palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA QTL on SSC8 have been shown to be segregating in different crosses of the IBMAP population  and both QTL have a pleiotropic effect on BF and IMF FA deposits. Gene annotation of the two TAS genomic regions allowed us to identify genes related to FA metabolism. In the first region  the genes  () (at position 92.67 Mb) and  () (at position 93.13 Mb) were found. Both genes have recently been reported in a predicted co-association gene network for intramuscular FA composition in pigs (Ramayo .  2013; unpublished observations).  is a member of the  gene family  which plays an essential role in the stabilization of Notch transcriptional activation complexes []. This Notch signaling pathway mediates short-range communication between cells  and it has recently been associated with the regulation of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis in liver []. A 931-bp fragment of the pig  gene that covers part of the promoter region and part of exon 1  was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced. Two novel microsatellites were found:  a (CA) tandem repeat located in the promoter region and  a (CGG) tandem repeat identified in exon 1. The variability of both microsatellites is described in Table . The product of the  gene is a histone methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates Lys-4 of histone H3 [] and  thus  it is involved in the epigenetic transcriptional regulation of genes  activating genes such as  or []. To identify polymorphims in the porcine  gene  a 839-bp fragment of the  promoter and exon 1 was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced. In addition  the identification of polymorphisms in the entire coding region of the  gene was performed using  data [] with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software (). Alignment and analysis of these sequences led to the identification of nine polymorphisms (Table ). Two of these polymorphisms were used to genotype BC1_LD animals  one located in the promoter region () and one non-synonymous polymorphism in exon 6 ()  which determines an amino-acid change of valine to leucine. Apart from the fact that these SNPs are located in the  gene  they were selected because they showed divergent allelic frequencies between the Iberian and Landrace IBMAP founders i.e. the  and  alleles were fixed in the Iberian boars. Complete linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was observed in the genotyped BC1_LD animals and  thus  only  was further genotyped in 168 animals belonging to the F generation. In the second region  the  gene was identified at position 120.12 Mb. The  gene is a strong positional and functional candidate gene involved in  lipogenesis and acts on the elongation of SFA and MUFA. A polymorphism in the promoter region of this gene () has previously been associated with percentages of palmitic and palmitoleic FA in muscle and backfat in the BC1_LD population []. In addition  expression of the  gene was lower in the backfat of animals with the Iberian allele in comparison to those with the Landrace allele. As expected from the elongation function of this gene  a lower  expression was associated with a higher percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic FA in muscle and adipose tissue []. Based on our results  the observed effects on FA composition and indices are concordant with a lower expression of the  gene in animals with the Iberian allele [] for both TAS regions (Figure ).  elongates palmitic (C16:0) to stearic (C18:0)  and palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) to vaccenic (C18:1(n-7)) FA. Thus  a lower ELOVL6 activity associated with the Iberian allele will directly decrease these elongation ratios. Moreover  as observed  a lower ELOVL6 activity will result in the accumulation of palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1(n-7)) FA and a reduction in stearic (C18:0) FA content (Figure ).  Statistically significant FA (red square) and ratios of elongation and desaturation (colored arrows) are shown for BF FA composition in the F generation. Regarding oleic FA (C18:1(n-9))  the main dietary FA  its content in BF was decreased in animals with the Iberian allele for the TAS regions on SSC8. It must be noted that the opposite effect was observed in the major SSC4 and SSC6 TAS regions for oleic (C18:1(n-9)) IMF content []. The expression profiles of the pig  and  genes were studied in liver and BF tissues of 56 BC1_LD females by RT-qPCR. The analysis of gene expression in the F generation was not possible because tissues for RNA isolation were not available. Differences in the expression of  among animals were observed  with coefficients of variation (CV) of 35% and 42% in liver and BF  respectively. The  gene expression was less variable  with CV values of 18% and 33% in liver and BF tissue  respectively. However  no significant differences in expression of  were detected among animals classified according to the  genotypes (either  or ) in either tissue. Similarly  no differences in expression of  were observed among animals classified according to the  and  microsatellites. In addition  no significant correlation was found between expression levels of  or  in the liver and adipose  which suggests that different and tissue-specific mechanisms control the liver and adipose tissue expression of  and . Two microsatellites in the  gene ( and )  one SNP in the  gene ()  and one SNP in the  gene () were used to genotype 168 animals of the F generation. An association analysis with these markers and the SSC8 genotypes from the 133 SNPs of our custom porcine SNP panel was performed. For the first region (93 Mb)  polymorphisms in the  and  genes were studied. For   the  polymorphism did not show the most significant association (Table ). In addition   gene microsatellites showed no significant associations for any of the traits studied. However  the SNPs showing the strongest signals (Table ) were located within a 2 Mb interval of the  and  genes. These results suggest that other non-genotyped polymorphisms may cause the observed effects on FA composition in the 93-Mb region. For the second region (119 Mb)  a polymorphism in the  gene was studied. The  polymorphism showed the highest association with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic FA  ACL  and C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) ratios (Table ). Hence  these results are consistent with those found in the IMF FA composition of the BC1_LD generation []. The clear association of the  polymorphism with percentage of FA in IMF and BF indicates a pleiotropic effect of this gene in both tissues. Analysis of the additive value of SNPs  and  showed a higher contribution of  SNP for all studied FA and indices. Furthermore  the additive value of the two SNPs [See Additional file : Table S5] showed an effect in the same direction. For instance  the Iberian alleles of both QTL increased palmitic and palmitoleic FA content and reduced the elongation ratios. These results are in accordance with the reported Iberian-Landrace breed differences in BF FA composition []. In summary  two TAS regions at 93 Mb and 119 Mb on SSC8 affect BF FA composition. Both regions showed a strong effect on palmitoleic acid content and C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios. The  and  genes were analyzed as positional candidate genes of the 93-Mb TAS region. Two novel microsatellites were identified in the  gene  and nine SNPs in the  gene. However  the association analysis did not reveal any significant association between the  microsatellite genotypes and the traits studied  and the  SNP did have not the strongest signal in the 93 Mb region. Although the expression of  and  genes in liver and adipose tissue varied among animals  it was not associated with any of the genotyped polymorphisms in these genes. These results suggest that the polymorphisms studied in  and  are not the causal variants of the 93-Mb QTL. Conversely  for the 119-Mb region  the  SNP was strongly associated with percentage of palmitic and palmitoleic FA  ACL  and C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1(n-7)/C16:1(n-7) elongation ratios. These results suggest pleiotropic effects of  on BF and IMF FA composition.

Archaeological remains indicate early goat domestication (about 10 000 years ago) in the Iranian Zagros Mountains as well as in the high Euphrates valley and southeastern Anatolia. In addition  mitochondrial DNA data of domestic goats and wild ancestors ( or bezoar) suggest a pre-domestication management of wild populations in southern Zagros and central Iranian Plateau. In this study genetic diversity was assessed in seven Iranian native goat breeds  namely Markhoz  Najdi  Taleshi  Khalkhali  Naini  native Abadeh and Turki-Ghashghaei. A total of 317 animals were characterized using 14 microsatellite loci. Two Pakistani goat populations  Pahari and Teddy  were genotyped for comparison.ResultsIranian goats possess a remarkable genetic diversity (average expected heterozygosity of 0.671 across loci  10.7 alleles per locus) mainly accounted for by the within-breed component (<U+2009>=<U+2009>5.9%). Positive and highly significant  values in the Naini  Turki-Ghashghaei  Abadeh and Markhoz breeds indicate some level of inbreeding in these populations. Multivariate analyses cluster Iranian goats into northern  central and western groups  with the western breeds relatively distinct from the others. Pakistani breeds show some relationship with Iranian populations  even if their position is not consistent across analyses. Gene flow was higher within regions (west  north  central) compared to between regions but particularly low between the western and the other two regions  probably due to the isolating topography of the Zagros mountain range. The Turki-Ghashghaei  Najdi and Abadeh breeds are reared in geographic areas where mtDNA provided evidence of early domestication. These breeds are highly variable  located on basal short branches in the neighbor-joining tree  close to the origin of the principal component analysis plot and  although highly admixed  they are quite distinct from those reared on the western side of the Zagros mountain range.ConclusionsThese observations call for further investigation of the nuclear DNA diversity of these breeds within a much wider geographic context to confirm or re-discuss the current hypothesis (based on maternal lineage data) of an almost exclusive contribution of the eastern Anatolian bezoar to the domestic goat gene pool."

These observations call for further investigation of the nuclear DNA diversity of these breeds within a much wider geographic context to confirm or re-discuss the current hypothesis (based on maternal lineage data) of an almost exclusive contribution of the eastern Anatolian bezoar to the domestic goat gene pool. Goats are multi-purpose animals that produce milk  meat and fiber and also serve other beneficial roles. In particular  they contribute to the economy of farmers living in arid and semi-arid regions  including southern Iran []. Although goat products are often cheaper than sheep products in the market place  goats are favored in the most marginal areas of Iran  where they are easier to manage and better adapted to harsh climate and ecological conditions than sheep. According to the latest livestock census  conducted in 2008  the Iranian caprine population is around 25 300 000 animals (). Iranian goats are mainly reared in traditional systems by small holders. Since nomadic tribes are almost completely economically dependent on animal rearing  these stakeholders play an important role in the conservation of animal genetic resources  especially of small ruminants. Genetic diversity is an essential component for population survival  evolution  genetic improvement and adaptation to changing environmental conditions []. Information on genetic diversity is therefore necessary to optimize both conservation and strategies for the use of animal genetic resources  to meet future market demands and improved production systems. Molecular tools permit the characterization of genetic resources at the DNA level. Because of favorable characteristics  such as abundant number  high polymorphism and co-dominant inheritance  microsatellite DNA markers have been extensively used for a number of applications in livestock genetics  including parentage testing  breed classification  conservation genetics and also to assess genetic variation and structure within and among populations []. This study was undertaken to examine the pattern of microsatellite variation within and among seven Iranian goat breeds. The resulting information may be used in national plans for sustainable improvement and conservation of goat genetic resources. This research was carried out as part of the IAEA-FAO joint program “Characterization of genetic resources in small ruminants in Asia” (D3.10.25)  which aimed at developing methodologies  generating information and formulating decision support systems to analyze phenotypic and molecular genetic diversity  develop microsatellite and related technologies  and enable the development and implementation of national and regional strategies for optimum use and conservation of small ruminants in Asia (). Iranian goats were sampled in six different areas that extended from the north of Iran  in the Alborz Mountains  south of the Caspian Sea  to the far western border of Iran  in the northern Zagros Mountains  to southern Zagros  along the mountain range. Seven indigenous goat breeds were mainly distributed in six provinces: Gilan  Ardabil  Isfahan  Fars  Kurdistan and Khuzestan (Table ). A maximum number of five samples per flock were collected from an average of 11 flocks per breed (min<U+2009>=<U+2009>5  max<U+2009>=<U+2009>18). Two Pakistani goat breeds  collected from the Punjab province  were also included in the dataset for comparison. The geographic distribution of Iranian breeds sampled in this study is depicted in Figure  and their typical phenotype in Figure .                                                       Breed ID  age of animal in years (yrs) and age are shown in the white boxes. The salting-out method [] was used to isolate genomic DNA from blood samples of 317 animals from the seven Iranian and two Pakistani goat breeds. Fourteen microsatellite markers were chosen from the list recommended by the FAO []. Forward primers were end-labeled with fluorescent dyes (6-FAM  VIC  NED and PET) [see Additional file ]. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was carried out on 50-100 ng of genomic DNA in a 15 µL reaction containing 1.5 µL of 10× PCR buffer  1 µL of 20 mM dNTPs  0.2 µL of each primer at a concentration of 10 µM and 1 unit DNA polymerase. Each marker was amplified individually. The “Touchdown” PCR protocol used an initial 5 min denaturation step at 95°C  followed by 3 cycles at 95°C during 45 s and 60°C during 1 min  3 cycles at 95°C during 45 s and 57°C during 1 min  3 cycles at 95°C during 45 s and 54°C during 1 min  3 cycles at 95°C during 45 s and 51°C during 1 min and 20 cycles at 92°C during 45 s and 48°C during 1 min  a 45 s extension step at 72°C and a final 10 min extension step at 72°C. Microsatellite genotypes were visualized with the ABI PRISM 3130XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems  USA) and alleles were scored using GeneMapper™ software Version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems  USA). In total  11 samples from four populations (KHL  TAL  MKZ and NAI) were genotyped in duplicate  to evaluate data quality and repeatability. To ensure correct genotype scoring  visual inspection was carried out independently by two experienced operators and all conflicting scores sorted out. Unbiased estimates of genetic diversity ()  observed heterozygosity () and mean number of alleles (MNA) were calculated using the Microsatellite Toolkit []. The probability-test (exact HW test)  used to assess deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each locus and population and for loci over all populations  was performed with Genepop 4.0 using a Markov chain of 100 000 steps and 1000 dememorization steps  500 batches and 10 000 iterations per batch [].  values from multiple comparisons were corrected using a Bonferroni correction []. Null alleles can decrease estimates of genetic diversity and inflate genetic differentiation []. To estimate the potential frequency of null alleles (r) for each locus in each breed  we used the EM algorithm of [] in the software FreeNA []. This method assumes that deviations from HWE do not result from other causes (e.g. from the Wahlund effect). Values of r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2 are expected not to cause significant problems in the analyses []. FSTAT program version 2.9.3 [] was used to estimate Wright’s fixation indices []. Standard errors were generated using the jack-knife method over loci and populations. The same software was used to calculate the inbreeding coefficient () for each population and a pairwise  distance matrix. The rarefaction technique of El Mousadik and Petit (1996) [] was used in FSTAT to calculate allelic richness (number of alleles in a sample of standardized size). Cervus 3.0 was used to calculate the polymorphism information content (PIC) of each locus []. The number of effective alleles (Ne) per locus in each population [] was calculated with the POPGENE 1.32 software []. The average number of effective migrants exchanged per generation (gene flow  Nm) was calculated with the following formula: Nm<U+2009>=<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)/(4) as applied in Genetix 4.05 []. This software was also used to estimate unbiased Nei’s coefficient of gene variation () []. Beaumont and Nichols’s approach []  implemented in LOSITAN [] was used to detect loci under selection. This software uses computer simulation to detect loci for which the genetic diversity within (heterozygosity) and between populations (F) do not conform to the prediction of a simple island model obtained by coalescent simulations []. Similarity in / values for all loci indicates a shared demographic history. Loci showing unusually large amounts of differentiation may mark regions of the genome that have been subject to directional selection  while loci showing unusually small amounts of differentiation may mark regions of the genome that have been subject to balancing selection []. All loci outside a 99.5% confidence interval were removed and the mean  was calculated again. A final run included all loci. The infinite allele model and 95 000 simulations were used in this calculation. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was conducted with geographical location as grouping factor  using Arlequin 3.11. Goat breeds were spatially partitioned into five groups including (A) TAL and KHL  (B) NAI  TUR and ABD  (C)MKZ  (D)NAJ and (E) TED and PAH (Pakistani populations). AMOVA was used to measure the extent of hierarchical genetic differentiation among the locations  among populations within a location  and among individual within a population []. Three approaches were used to analyze the genetic relationships among individuals and populations: (i) genetic distances and dendrograms  (ii) model-based cluster analysis  and (iii) principal components analysis (PCA). A dendrogram was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithm [] in DISPAN []  based on Nei’s genetic distance () []. Trees were edited with MEGA4 []. The Bayesian model-based clustering method implemented in STRUCTURE software [] was used to investigate population structure and define clusters of individuals on the basis of multi-locus genotypes. The number of assumed clusters () varied between 2 and 11. For each   10 independent runs were performed with a burn-in of 10 and Markov chain Monte Carlo length of 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 iterations under an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies and no prior information on the population of origin (popinfo<U+2009>=<U+2009>0). The assignment probabilities were compiled for multiple runs in the program CLUMPP  which addresses multimodality and/or label-switching in run comparisons []. We used the Greedy algorithm to increase computational speed  set the pairwise similarity matrix to G’ and ran 1000 random repeats of the data for the determined value of . The results of STRUCTURE analyses were depicted using the software Distruct []. The estimate of the best  was calculated as described by Evanno et al. [] using Structure Harvester v.0.6.92 []. PCA was performed using XLSTAT software (Addinsoft  Paris) to summarize and visualize the structure of data described by several quantitative variables  while obtaining the uncorrelated factors between them. A total of 154 genotypes were produced on the 11 animals  which were genotyped twice. All genotypes were identical between replicates indicating a very high repeatability of the genotyping and scoring procedures adopted. A total of 150 alleles were detected at the 14 microsatellite loci in the nine goat breeds. Allele number ranged from five (MAF035) to 18 (ILSTS029) per locus and the average number was equal to 10.7. Most loci displayed a high degree of polymorphism  as revealed by the PIC values that ranged between 0.435 (INRA0132) and 0.851 (MAF70)  with a mean of 0.67. Relevant information per locus  such as the range of allele sizes  location on chromosomes  sequence and label of the primers  number of alleles (observed and effective)  PIC and deviation from HWE  are presented in Additional file  [see Additional file ]. Seven out of 14 loci deviated from HWE after sequential Bonferroni correction (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Five populations  NAI  TUR  ABD  MKZ and TED  showed deviation from HWE for at least one locus (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Nine of the 126 locus<U+2009>×<U+2009>population combinations revealed significant departures from HWE. Several estimates of the frequency of null alleles (r) were greater than 0.11  i.e. for BMS1494  ILSTS029 and MAF035 [see Additional file ]. As previously reported  values of r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2 are expected not to cause significant problems in the analysis []. The only exception was the ILSTS029 locus in the ABD population  for which r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.23. Frequency distributions of two loci (BM1818 and MCM527) were indicative of balancing selection at the 99.5% probability level  whereas directional selection was suggested at the loci MAF035 and ILSTS029 (Figure ). Since there was a strong suggestion that the MAF035 locus was under selection because of its low heterozygosity and low number of alleles (Table ; Figure )  it was excluded from further analyses. Conversely  to avoid too much loss of information  all other markers were retained  including BM1818 that was reported to flank QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) for fertility and milk traits in cattle []. Based on the raw data for 13 markers  the largest mean number of alleles (MNA) was observed in TUR (8.00) and the smallest in NAJ (4.69). NAJ had the fewest samples (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>20)  but this trend remained consistent for corrected allelic richness ()  which was also greatest in TUR (5.99) but smallest in NAJ (4.25). The mean of the effective number of alleles per locus and population ranged from 2.65 (NAJ) to 4.00 (KHL) (Table ). The mean effective number of alleles had a global mean of 3.50 across all loci  which was remarkably lower than the mean observed number of alleles (10.7). The average unbiased expected heterozygosity over all loci ranged from 0.58 (NAJ) to 0.72 (ABD). The overall mean of gene diversity was equal to 0.671 (Table ). ABD (0.602) and TAL (0.710) had the lowest and the highest observed heterozygosity  respectively (Table ). The mean  across all loci and breeds was equal to 0.052.  were significantly greater than zero in NAI  TUR  ABD (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and MKZ (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01)  which indicated inbreeding in these breeds (Table ).  Outliers are tagged with labels. The global  obtained by the jack-knife method over loci was equal to 0.062<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.016 and significantly different from zero (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). Wright’s -statistics were calculated for each of the 13 microsatellite loci across the nine breeds [see Additional file ]. The AMOVA revealed that most of the molecular variance occurred within breeds (92.90%) while it represented 3.73% among geographic groups and 2.07% among breeds within a geographic group (Table ). Although small  the group/breed components were both statistically significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01 and <U+2009><<U+2009>0.001  respectively). Very similar results were obtained by clustering breeds according to the groups identified in the STRUCTURE analyses. The  values between breed pairs ranged from 0.0041 for the TAL-KHL pair to 0.1622 between PAH and MKZ breeds. Pairwise estimates of  for north (TAL and KHL) and center (NAI  TUR and ABD) of Iran were not significant. For all remaining breed pairs   values were highly significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001) (Table ).The number of migrants per generation (Nm) ranged from 60.23 between TAL and KHL populations to 1.29 between MKZ and PAH populations (Table ). A gene flow of 3.62 was obtained between the two Pakistani goat breeds  PAH and TED. Nei’s genetic distances () ranged from 0.0521 between TAL and KHL to 0.2760 between NAJ and PAH. The two Pakistani breeds (TED and PAH) showed the lowest  distance with TUR. Nei’s standard genetic distance () ranged from 0.0108 (TAL-KHL) to 0.4269 (PAH-MKZ). TED and PAH showed the lowest  distances with the Iranian KHL and TUR goat breeds [see Additional file ]. A NJ tree was constructed based on  genetic distances (Figure ). Most of the bootstrap values were high (> 70%)  which indicated that the dendrogram was very robust. According to the NJ tree  Iranian populations showed a clear clustering  in agreement with the traditional breed classification and geographical origin. An exception was the inclusion in the same cluster of MKZ and NAJ breeds in spite of their rather distant distribution areas  adaptation to different climates and different production purposes. However  they are separated by long branches  indicating that  although they share a common ancestry  they still remain well differentiated. In the  tree  the two Pakistani breeds (TED and PAH) cluster with the northern Iranian breeds (TAL and KHL)  even if the branch lengths indicate that they remain rather distant from the Iranian pool and from each other. PCA grouped Iranian breeds in accordance with the NJ trees (Figure A).The first component separates populations according to a northwest to southeast gradient  while the second has no clear geographic component. Northern (TAL and KHL) and central (TUR  NAI and ABD) breeds form two groups  while  the western (MKZ) and southwestern (NAJ) breeds clearly separate from each other and also from the other breeds. Inclusion of the two Pakistani breeds (Figure B) does not change the configuration of the Iranian breeds. However  in this case  PAH and TED appear to be closer to the central breeds (NAI and TUR) rather than to the northern ones (TAL and KHL) as in the NJ representations. In the STRUCTURE analysis  <U+2009>=<U+2009>5 resulted as the most appropriate number of partitions [See Additional file  and Additional file ]. Analysis at <U+2009>=<U+2009>5 divided Iranian goats into three clusters formed by populations from the north (TAL and KHL)  center (NAI  TUR and ABD) and west (MKZ and NAJ) of Iran. The two Pakistani breeds were assigned to two other distinct clusters (Figure ). Admixture was particularly evident between central and northern Iranian clusters  with some components also contributed by the Pakistani PAH breed  whereas the western Iranian cluster formed a quite distinct gene pool.   Numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values based on 1000 permutations.  The principal components were extracted by correlation coefficients of Pearson  based on allele frequencies.

Each of the 317 animals is represented by a thin vertical line that is divided into segments the size and color of which correspond to the relative proportion of the animal genome assigned to a particular cluster; breeds are separated by thin black lines.  Estimated population structure displayed with individual -scores.  Estimated population structure displayed with population average -scores. Iran is close to  and in the case of goats  within  the main south west Asian livestock domestication center. In fact  archaeological remains indicate an early goat domestication (about 10 000 years ago) in the Iranian Zagros Mountains []  as well as in the high Euphrates valley and southeastern Anatolia []. In addition  analysis of mitochondrial DNA of domestic goats and their wild ancestors ( or bezoar) revealed signals of population expansions in wild populations in southern Zagros (Fars Province) and in the central Iranian Plateau (Yazd and Kerman Provinces)  likely indicating a pre-domestication management of wild populations []. These regions were therefore hypothesized to be the site of origin of one of the mtDNA haplogroups (the C haplogroup) and of “an incipient goat domestication phase”. However  haplogroup C has a modest frequency within the mitochondrial gene pool of modern goats  thus suggesting that these regions may not have contributed much to the molecular variability of domestic goat maternal lines  and definitely much less than eastern Anatolian sites. Therefore  it is highly interesting to investigate the genetic diversity of Iranian farm animals for several reasons: (1) social and economic role that these livestock play within the country  (2) their geographic area of origin and (3) new information on the domestication processes that may arise from the analysis of the nuclear genome of local genetic resources. Particularly intriguing would be to test if nuclear DNA data agree with mtDNA information in estimating a marginal involvement of Iranian and a major contribution of Anatolian gene pools into goat domestication processes. The analysis of 13 microsatellites resulted in a mean genetic diversity of 0.671 (Table ). Although comparison with investigations using different marker sets is only indicative  the value we observed is greater than those reported in Swiss goat breeds (0.51 to 0.58) genotyped at 20 microsatellite loci [] and in 11 indigenous south east Asian goats analyzed with 25 microsatellites (0.43-0.60) []  but it is slightly lower than those reported in Chinese goat breeds (0.77-0.82) analyzed with six microsatellite loci []. However  Di et al. [] assessed the genetic diversity of nine Chinese cashmere goats  two Iranian goats and one breed from Guinea Bissau using 14 microsatellite markers and found the greatest diversity among the Iranian breeds. In the present study  expected heterozygosity and allelic richness had the highest values for ABD and TUR (two Iranian goats) with means of 0.72 and 5.99  respectively. We can thus conclude that Iranian goats possess a remarkably high genetic diversity  as expected  for native populations in the vicinity of a domestication center. With the exception of NAJ  the surveyed populations had higher expected than observed heterozygosities. This resulted in positive  values that were highly significant for NAI  TUR  ABD and MKZ (Table )  indicating some level of inbreeding in these populations.  reached the remarkable value of 16.6% in ABD. The presence of null alleles probably contributed to the very high  value observed in this breed. Conversely the Wahlund effect  did not contribute to increase  values  since no population substructure was detected in the four inbred breeds by Bayesian cluster analysis. The investigated goat breeds showed a remarkable difference between the effective and the observed number of alleles (sometimes a decrease of more than 50%) [see Additional file ]  due to a very low frequency of many alleles across loci. This effect may result from the combined effects of the exchange of migrants between populations and of the post-domestication population expansion that can still be detected in traditionally managed populations nearby domestication sites  as opposed to western breeds that have likely lost many rare alleles by genetic drift during the process of breed formation. An overall mean of <U+2009>=<U+2009>5.9% (based on 13 markers) indicated that within-breed diversity accounts for a large part of the total genetic diversity of the breeds investigated. This observation is confirmed by AMOVA and by the low average pairwise  value (0.062; Table  and Additional file ). This value is similar to that i.e. 0.069 reported by Canon et al[] but lower than values reported for south-east Asian (0.14; []) and Swiss goat breeds (0.17; []). The test for neutrality (Figure  and Additional file ) suggested that some loci are under directional (MAF035 and ILSTS029) and balancing selection (BM1818 and MCM527). Since a panel comprising only a few microsatellite markers is of limited interest to identify selection signatures  here the test was used merely to decide if certain markers were to be eliminated from population genetic analyses to avoid biased results []. However  these loci might merit further investigation  since they are potentially associated to traits of interest  e.g. the MAF035 locus has been associated with a QTL for carcass traits (percent lean in carcass and total fat) in sheep [] and BM1818 to QTL for milk and fertility traits in cattle []. The distribution of the Iranian breeds described by PCA (Figure A) is consistent with the geographical locations of the farms where samples were collected (Figure )  confirming at the country level that differentiation of diversity in nuclear genomes of goat breeds contains a significant portion of geographic structure  as has already been reported at the continental level []. Interestingly  this geographic structure is maintained also in a system of traditional pastoralism  as that present in Iran  in spite of the fact that nomadism and gene flow exist among the populations. The exchange of migrants among populations is  in fact  relevant (Table )  in particular among the two northern breeds and  to a lesser extent  among the three central breeds. Gene flow is higher within regions compared to between regions and is particularly low between the west and the other regions  due to the topography of the Zagros mountain range. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis are consistent with this interpretation (Figure ). Western breeds (MKZ and NAJ) form a defined cluster at  ranging from 2 to the most probable value (<U+2009>=<U+2009>5). At this value of   Iranian breeds from the north (TAL and KHL)  center (NAI  TUR and ABD) and west and south-west (MKZ and NAJ) form three clusters. The level of admixture is high in breeds from central Iran. It is lower in northern breeds that appear to contain almost identical proportions of ancestral genomes  confirming their high similarity as indicated by genetic parameters in the NJ tree and PCA. The two Pakistani populations constitute two distinct separate gene pools  although they originate from the same area (Punjab province) in Pakistan. Gene flow between these two breeds (Nm<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.62) confirms STRUCTURE  NJ and PCA analyses and indicates that PAH and TED are distinct  even if some animals from TED seem to have a large portion of their genome in common with PAH. Overall  NAJ and MKZ  although they share a common ancestry at <U+2009>=<U+2009>5 (Figure )  seem to be quite distinct from each other  as indicated by their  and  distances [see Additional file ]  low level of gene flow (Nm<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.71)  long branch length in NJ trees (Figure ) and clear separation in the PCA plot (Figure ). In fact  common ancestry does not necessarily imply similarity in gene frequencies. Genetics  geographic distance  agro-climatic conditions  phenotype and main use clearly distinguish these two breeds from each other. MKZ is a breed of the Kurdish areas (Kurdistan province) of Iran (Figure ). It is a Mohair-producing breed valued for its shiny fine fiber. It is well adapted to withstand the severe winters that occur in western Zagros  with average daily temperatures below 0°C and heavy snowfalls. A recent report indicates that this breed is presently endangered  due to reduction of population size and number of breeding herds. The population size of MKZ was estimated at over 22 000 animals in 1996  but has progressively decreased to around 5000 heads in 2005 []. NAJ  a dairy and fleece goat breed from the Arab region (Khuzestan province; Figure ) is adapted to extremely high temperatures. Morphologically  MKZ and NAJ are clearly different. The level of population differentiation and genetic structure observed in Iranian goat breeds are clearly different from that observed in Iranian sheep populations (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.02  unpublished data). This may be due to the massive amount of gene flow occurring in sheep by translocation of superior breeds over a large geographical distance  because of the higher economic importance of sheep compared to goats. Overall  the degree of differentiation at the few microsatellite marker loci used in this study might appear inadequate to represent the degree of differentiation among breeds that is perceived based on physical appearance and other phenotypic traits. However  “neutral” markers such as microsatellites are designed to reconstruct the evolutionary and demographic history of populations and are theoretically “blind” to the effect of natural and anthropogenic selection that is sometimes very effective and rapid in changing morphological and production traits []. It has been reported that degree of differentiation in quantitative traits () typically exceeds that observed in neutral marker genes () []  suggesting a prominent role for natural selection in accounting for patterns of quantitative trait differentiation among contemporary populations. Taken together  all the approaches used to analyze genetic relationship among individuals and populations in this study suggested a high molecular diversity in Iranian goats  with varying levels of genetic distinctiveness among breeds and considerable gene flow between breeds from the same geographic region. Between-breed diversity has a strong geographic component. Iranian goat breeds fall into three clusters  northern  central and western  with the western and southwestern breeds relatively distinct from others. Pakistani breeds show some relationships with Iranian populations  even if their position is not consistent across analyses. Pakistan and Iran are neighbors  connected by the Baluchistan region that is shared by the two countries. There is a long history of contact and mutual influence between the two countries. Agribusiness and livestock exchange have been ongoing for ages  so it is not surprising to find some similarity in the genetic background of Iranian and Pakistani goat breeds. In conclusion  to maintain the present genetic diversity and structure of these breeds  proper strategies of marker-assisted management need to be designed and implemented. Although a decreasing number of MKZ individuals has been noted  none of these breeds seem to be endangered according to the FAO risk classification system []. Therefore  breed management plans should emphasize sustainable use and development  rather than conservation . One suggested first step is to organize breeders into formal or informal associations  to facilitate development and implementation of genetic resource management strategies. Inbreeding seems to affect some breeds and an organization of breeders may allow for wider exchange of males within breeds  which would address this problem. Conversely  if the breeders express an interest in maintaining genetic purity  gene flow among breeds and regions should be monitored and avoided. Development of more complex strategies would benefit from the analysis of native breeds with high-density marker panels that can distinguish between neutral and selected genomic regions. This additional information would contribute to the decision making process  in particular by identifying patterns of diversity along genomes of neutral (present day) and selected (very near future) genomic regions. Three out of the seven investigated breeds are reared in geographic areas in which mtDNA provided evidence of early domestication. TUR and ABD (southern Zagros  Fars province) and NAI (central Zagros  Isfahan province) fall exactly in the area in which the C haplogroup is observed at high frequency []. Interestingly  these breeds are highly variable (Table )  are placed on basal short branches in the NJ tree (Figure )  close to the origin of the PCA plot (Figure ) and  although highly admixed  quite distinct from those reared on the western side of the Zagros mountain range. These observations reveal the necessity for further investigation of goat nuclear DNA diversity within a much wider geographic context  including Turkey  Europe and Asia. Such an investigation would help to clarify the events that occurred in central Zagros and to the west of the Zagros mountain range during domestication  either confirming or re-discussing the current hypothesis based on maternal lineage data of an almost exclusive contribution of the eastern Anatolian bezoar to the domestic goat gene pool.

In mammals and birds  embryonic development at the time of sex determination occurs under relatively controlled ambient temperature conditions. In contrast  fish are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) animals and embryonic development takes place in extreme physical environments with relatively marked alternations of temperature. For certain fish species  there is increasing evidence that temperature may affect sex determination [  ]  which could explain the co-evolution of their widespread distribution and wide temperature tolerance range. In fish  the first evidence of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was presented in 1981 from field and laboratory studies on the Atlantic silverside  []. Since then  TSD has been reported for about 60 different fish species belonging to 13 families representative of many types of fishes [  ]. Different terms are used to describe TSD including “temperature effects on sex ratio”  “temperature effects on sex differentiation”  “temperature influences on sex determination”  “thermolabile sex determination”  “temperature-dependent sex ratios”  “temperature-dependent sex differentiation”  “temperature induced sex reversal”  etc. In species with TSD  there is little information on the genetic differences between sexes. The earliest reported ontogenetic difference between sexes in species with TSD concerns environment-induced fluctuations i.e. changes in ambient temperature during the sensitive (or labile) periods of early development that determine phenotypic sex and sex ratio [  ]. In vertebrates  genetic sex determination (GSD) and TSD have different temporal patterns i.e. GSD occurs as soon as conception takes place and depends on the genetic constitution of the individual  while TSD occurs later during the thermosensitive period prior to and/or at the beginning of gonadal development []. It should be noted that the definition of TSD does not imply that genetic influences on gender are nonexistent because TSD and sex ratio cannot evolve without at least some genetic influence on sex determination []. It is not always easy to distinguish sex determination and sex differentiation because in many cases the same criteria based on morphological  cellular  and molecular analyses are used to investigate sex differentiation and to infer the genetic sex of an individual. For the purposes of this review  sex determination is used to describe the genetic and environmental processes and variables that influence sex differentiation  while sex differentiation is used to indicate the physical realization of these events in terms of testicular or ovarian development. The definition of TSD originates from studies on reptiles (lizards and turtles)  in which sex differentiation and the thermosensitive period (TSP) occur during the embryogenetic period (incubation) [–]. In contrast  in fish species  sex differentiation occurs during the post-embryonic period of larval development (post-hatching). Therefore  the criteria that are used to identify TSD in reptiles cannot be applied in fish. The criteria for distinguishing GSD  TSD and GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE (GSD plus temperature effects) have been extensively discussed by Valenzuela et al. [] and Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer []. According to the criteria of Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer []  only 40 of the 59 fish species for which TSD was claimed on the basis of laboratory and/or field data could be classified as species with TSD  which suggests that TSD is less common than initially thought. In other words  based on their criteria  the sex-determining mechanism of about one third of the fish species that were thought to have TSD may have GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE. Such studies are challenging because they require knowledge on the conditions that are normally encountered in the wild by a particular species or population during the sensitive period of development. Moreover  experimental designs that are aimed at distinguishing between TSD from GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE by mimicking natural temperature fluctuations can be difficult to carry out because extreme conditions may simply alter the process of sex differentiation in a species with GSD only and yield skewed sex ratios []. Temperature effects on the sex ratio during the thermosensitive period in a fish species that is claimed to have TSD  should occur as an inheritable trait  i.e. its analysis at the population level should reveal an evolutionary pattern rather than an occasional pattern. However  negative results from studies that test a population for TSD may only reflect the status of a particular geographic population and not the species as a whole  because TSD in fish frequently involves genotype by temperature interaction with strong parental effects on family sex ratio. Indeed  in Atlantic silverside and other fish species  temperature sensitive and insensitive populations that occupy different locations have been observed []. In addition  we reported in the bluegill sunfish  the existence of two contrasted temperature-sensitive populations (in which the proportion of males increased with either increasing or decreasing temperature) as well as temperature insensitive populations ([] and personal communication). As sex-determining mechanisms  TSD and GSD should be considered in an equivalent manner []  which leads to reconsider the status of fish species that are claimed to have TSD when submitted to extreme temperatures instead of the temperature experienced during development in the wild since changes in sex ratio with temperature variation are ecologically and evolutionally relevant. Furthermore  in zebrafish ()  it was found that hypoxia can affect sex differentiation and sex development along with down-regulations of various genes that control the synthesis of sex hormones and the increase of the testosterone/estradiol ratio  thus producing male-skewed population versus normoxic groups []. It was also shown that hypoxia disrupts primordial germ cell migration during embryonic development through the induction of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in zebrafish embryos [  ] and in the Atlantic croaker  after exposure to natural or laboratory hypoxia []. Taken together these results suggest that  in some cases  hypoxia rather than extreme high temperatures may contribute to variation in sex ratio since high temperature is considered to decrease the relative water oxygen solubility and may result in hypoxia []. These factors will need to be taken into account in future studies. TSD is said to occur when the water temperature experienced by the offspring irreversibly determines its primary sex []. GSD occurs when primary sex is determined by the genotype at conception and is thereafter independent of environmental conditions. How and why transitions between TSD and GSD occur are two key questions about the evolution of TSD. Most of the hypotheses formulated to explain the evolution of TSD are adaptive  but neutral or quasi-neutral alternatives have also been proposed [] (Figure ). For example  in the Atlantic silverside  TSD is geography-dependent. In this species  female-biased populations are produced in the early spawning period while male-biased populations are produced later and the change in sex ratio with temperature is greater at low latitudes where the breeding and growing seasons are longer than at high latitudes where the breeding and growing seasons are comparatively short []. TSD is adaptive in this fish species because the longer growing season afforded to the female fish allows them to reach a larger size by the time breeding occurs  and a size advantage is more favorable to females than to males []. Hence  in Atlantic silverside  both extreme northern and extreme southern populations are GSD (without TSD)  while intermediate populations show the maximum level of sex ratio response to temperature (with TSD).  The way the sex-determining (SD) modes are presented does not indicate ancestral states. GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE  genetic sex determination plus temperature effects. The data presented are a compilation from Valenzuela []. In   it has been shown that TSD is a highly evolved trait that responds rapidly to selection rather than merely the plasticity of a primitive sex-determining mechanism []. Schwanz et al. [] proposed that evolutionary transitions from GSD to TSD (with no sex chromosomes) can occur rapidly and readily through the acquisition of thermosensitivity by selection for TSD without crossing a fitness valley  which was first described by Bull [  ]. Evolutionary transitions from TSD to GSD are also considered as simple and straightforward [  ]. Surprisingly  both TSD and GSD have evolved multiple times in the course of vertebrate history via a parsimony-based statistical framework []. It was shown that TSD was lost at least six times in turtles and arose at least three times in lizards []. Accordingly  since both GSD and TSD have been “lost” and “found” numerous times in vertebrates  the phylogenetic lability of sex-determining mechanisms is extraordinary  which agrees with the above-mentioned hypothesis on transitions between TSD and GSD. An important aspect to be taken into account is that regardless of whether one species has TSD or GSD (or GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE)  under certain circumstances (e.g. under extraordinary natural conditions or when moved to laboratory conditions)  fish can respond to temperature changes  which leads to skewed sex ratios. Such effects of the temperature on sex ratios apparently involve the same downstream signaling pathways as TSD. It is possible that  in fish  some steps of the pathways involved in TSD and GSD are similar. Independently of whether sex determination is pure TSD or GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE  it is clear that fish offer an excellent model to explore the plasticity of the mechanisms of sex determination and sex differentiation. Our aim is to standardize the criteria that distinguish TSD and GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE by pooling the data of TSD and GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE together and review the molecular players that underlie the temperature effects in sex determination and differentiation. Investigating the genes that are involved in TSD is interesting but information is scarce  even in reptiles. So far  only a few candidate genes associated with temperature-induced sex reversal were studied in fish species. It is assumed that the thermal master switch  which triggers the undifferentiated gonads to follow the male or female pathway  will be the gene(s) that activate the thermosensitive period (TSP) or specify responses during this developmental time window. Candidates for this role would be genes that are expressed prior to  or exactly at  the onset of the TSP  rather than genes that are differentially expressed after TSP activation []. Two such potential master switch genes  the  and  genes that are involved in the formation of a bipotential gonad  have been proposed on the basis of their early significant differential expression before the onset of the TSP in reptiles with TSD. Other genes that have been proposed are        () and  that are associated with the testis-determining pathway   and  that are involved in intersecting pathways and  and  that determine the ovarian pathway [–]. To our knowledge  none of these genes have been reported to be responsible for TSD or to be direct targets of temperature-dependent sex differentiation in fish. In this article  first we review the genes that are known to play a role in GSD  and then the genes that are expressed downstream in the sex determination cascade and involved in TSD and GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE and in the putative mechanisms that underlie the effect of temperature on sex differentiation. The cortisol-mediated pathway and epigenetic regulatory pathway are also summarized. Our aim is to propose a review of the literature on the master genes involved in TSD to stimulate future investigations. The  gene is a master sex-determining gene that was first described in 2002 in the medaka    which has an XX/XY (female homogamety) sex-determining system [  ]. It is an excellent candidate as a primary male determining gene equivalent to the  gene of mammals. The gene  designated [] or []  was located in the Y-specific chromosomal region that contains the male determining gene. It is important to note that this is the only structural gene  which specifies a functional protein in the Y-specific chromosome region [  ]. The product of this gene contains a DNA-binding domain called the DM domain  a structural motif present in a family of genes that is found in a wide range of invertebrates and vertebrates from nematodes and flies to humans [–]. The / gene is assumed to have arisen from a recent duplication event (5 to 10 million years ago) of the autosomal  gene [  ]. A fragment of the medaka linkage group 9 that contains the  gene was duplicated and inserted into the chromosome of linkage group 1  which subsequently became the Y chromosome []. The  gene is expressed before the sex-determining period  specifically  before the first appearance of morphological sex differences at the hatching stage when the male exhibits a decreased number of primordial germ cells []. The level of expression of the  gene during the sex-determining period appears to be critical for its function  since mutants that do not express this gene fail to become males and develop as sex-reversed XY females [  ]. In sex-reversed XY females induced by estrogen treatment  the  gene is expressed in the ovaries at a level similar to that in the testes  which means that the expression of this gene is not affected by the administration of exogenous estrogen []. Furthermore  the early expression of  in the somatic cells of the undifferentiated gonad is not influenced by 17ß-estradiol (E  natural estrogen) treatment []. In addition  a high-temperature treatment (above 27°C) during the sex-determining period fails to induce expression of  although it leads to the masculinization of medaka XX females []. In summary  the expression of  is in perfect agreement with its function as a male upstream determining gene in medaka. Two distinct natural mutations in the  gene present in wild medaka populations have been shown to induce XY genotypes to become fertile females []. A subsequent investigation on a natural mutant of medaka fry also showed an increased number of germ cells at day 0 post-hatching due to the low expression of   with fry developing into females []. A gene knockdown experiment that used gripNA antisense oligonucleotides directed against  transcripts also showed that  knockdown XY medaka fry and control XX females had comparable germ cell numbers  which indicates that the disruption of the  gene resulted in the gonads entering the female pathway []. Thus  the  gene is necessary for the development of males in medaka. Moreover  over-expression of  by injecting  genomic DNA fragment into XX female eggs or over-expression of the  cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter in XX females resulted in XX individuals developing into males []. These results indicate that expression of  may be sufficient to induce male development in XX females. Collectively  these results suggest that the  gene is a good candidate male determining gene at least in some of strains of medaka and its relative species [  ]. In terms of temperature effects on sex determination and differentiation  it is not yet known whether temperature can affect the expression of [] (see next section) although high-temperature treatments during the early stages of development result in females having a male phenotype. It is interesting to note that the thermosensitive period of sex differentiation in medaka lies between developmental stages 5 to 6 (8 to 16 cells) and 36 (heart development stage) []  which is just before expression of  begins (stage 36). It is assumed that the function of  in the male embryo during the sex-determining period is to control the proliferation of primordial germ cells []. Likewise  Selim et al. [] observed that a high-temperature treatment before hatching inhibited the proliferation of germ cells and the development of oocytes and consequently resulted in sex reversal. The fact that  and temperature have the same effects on the proliferation of primordial germ cells  and that genotypic (XY) males and genotypic (XX) females possess a dimorphic sensitive pattern to temperature during TSP [] show that temperature may play a pivotal role in female fate as does  in male fate during evolution. These reports also suggest that genetic as well as environmental factors are not incompatible in terms of effects on sex determination or differentiation with the existence of genotype by environment interactions  as already mentioned in fish species and reptiles [      ]. To understand the interaction between the sex-determining gene () and the environment factor (temperature)  the effects of temperature on the expression of  and its downstream targets should be investigated further. Just prior to and during the preparation of the present review  four additional strong candidate master sex-determining (SD) genes were reported in fish  which indicates that this area of study is moving fast. These include the genes  in Patagonian pejerrey []   in []   in fugu (tiger pufferfish) []  and  in rainbow trout []. All master SD genes reported to date are in Figure   which also includes the mammalian  gene  the  gene in birds  the  gene in   and the  gene in medaka .  The phylogeny is a compilation from Kikuchi and Hamaguchi []. SD: sex determination; TGF-ß  transforming growth factor ß; :  gene; :  gene (also known as    gene); :  () [    –  –]. These novel master SD genes highlight the importance of non-transcriptional factors in sex determination since three of these genes i.e.    and  are involved in the TGF-ß signaling pathway  while the      and  genes code for transcription factors (Figure ). In mammals  the TGF-ß signaling pathway has been shown to play important roles in the development of ovarian and testicular functions [  ] but there is no evidence that it may be involved in sex reversal. Nevertheless  the identification of the three SD genes     and [–] indicates that the TGF-ß signaling pathway plays a critical role in the commitment to the fate of either testicular or ovarian development. It has been hypothesized that this pathway may have a more dominant role in gonadal sex determination in non-mammalian vertebrates than in mammals []. For example  while  clearly lies far downstream in the sex determination pathway and is controlled by   it has been shown in chicken that the expression of  precedes that of  in males [  ]. In the American alligator  in which TSD is present  expression of  precedes the onset of  expression during testis differentiation []. Analysis of the expression patterns of    and  compared to that of  in different cell types ruled out the hypothesis that  is regulated directly by  or  at least in the granulosa cells of adult zebrafish ovaries []. These findings combined with the aforementioned results in different fish species corroborate or confirm this hypothesis. To date  one of the four novel SD genes    which is a truncated  divergent form of the immune-related gene []  has not been reported in the literature unlike the three others  which have been characterized and shown to play important conserved roles in the gonadal differentiation pathway across vertebrates. The  gene  which is expressed in the somatic cells that surround the germ cells  encodes a novel protein that displays sequence homology with the carboxy-terminal domain of []. IRF9 is a transcription regulatory factor that mediates signaling by type I interferon in mammals []. The  sequence is highly conserved in all salmonids and is a male specific Y-chromosome gene in the majority of these species except in two whitefish species (subfamily ) []. These results indicate that most salmonids share a conserved master sex-determining gene and that an alternative sex-determining system may have also evolved in this family. For more details  refer to Kikuchi and Hamaguchi []. Growing evidence demonstrates that the sex-determining pathways in fish species are conserved and diverse (Figure   see  and ). The  in  and  genes in  (a close relative of ) are estimated to have appeared about 10 and 5 million years ago  respectively []. It is very interesting to note that the expression of the  gene can lead to a male phenotype in XX medaka  in the absence of  expression The  gene is located downstream to  in  and originates from []  which means that  at present  it functions independently of the existing sex-determining gene  and has usurped the control of the downstream cascade of sex determination within 5 million years. Genetic by environment interactions are a hot topic. Nevertheless  no evidence has shown that temperature influences expression of sex-determining genes during the TSP. TSD is claimed in more and more fish species but how temperature can act as a signal for the undifferentiated gonad to generate a male or female pathway and what are the downstream target(s) of most sex-determining genes  remain to be elucidated (Figure ). The mechanisms that control sex determination and sex differentiation are highly variable among different phyla []. However  genes that are located downstream in the sex determination pathway are conserved []. For example  the  gene plays a pivotal role in the fate of gonads in fish  reptiles  birds and mammals  and is expressed in the developing gonads  or in the adult testis and/or in the ovary. The  gene encodes a putative transcription factor containing a zinc-finger-like DNA-binding motif (DM domain) and was initially identified in nematodes [] and flies []. This gene is regarded as a crucial regulator of male sexual development from invertebrates to humans [] and also as evidence that the sex determination and gonad differentiation mechanisms are conserved across different lineages [    ]. The ray-finned fish () has two paralogous copies for many genes (e.g.  and    and    and ) due to the hypothesized fish-specific genome duplication that is dated between 335 and 404 million year ago []. With the increasing availability of whole-genome sequences  the comparative analysis of genes and genomes will reveal the evolution and phenotypic diversification of the third round (and fourth round in some fish species such as common carp ) of genome duplication [–]. Some duplicated genes have evolved new functions  while others have disappeared []. In this review  we focus mainly on the  gene among the many duplicated genes that are mostly related to sex determination and differentiation and have been extensively investigated. The most direct evidence for the important role of the  gene has come from the discovery that the sex-determining gene of medaka   originates from a duplicated copy of the autosomal  gene []. In teleost fish  the expression of  is associated with temperature effects and displays variable patterns in different species (See Additional file : Table S1). In tilapia () and trout ()   is expressed in males prior to sex differentiation but not in females  which indicates that  in these fish species  it is involved in testis formation and differentiation [–]. However  in other fish species  like medaka  pejerrey ()  and European sea bass ()  sexually dimorphic expression of  in males and females was reported (See Additional file : Table S1)  which indicates that  in these cases   participates in testis and ovarian development. Regarding temperature effects on sex ratios  although expression profiles of  have been described in a limited number of fish species  the results suggest that it plays an essential function in male development and testis formation in fish species with TSD or GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE. In pejerrey  a fish species with pure TSD (based on the criteria of Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer [])  the abundance of  transcripts differed clearly between larvae reared at female producing (or promoting) temperature (FPT  100% female) and larvae reared at male producing temperature (MPT  100% male). The expression of  was significantly higher at MPT than at FPT during the two weeks before the first signs of morphological differentiation of the testis  and remained high during sexual differentiation at MPT  which highlights the importance of  during the first stage of the gonadal sex differentiation cascade  rather than during the morphological differentiation of the gonads. However  it is interesting to note that  in larvae reared at FPT   expression remained low throughout the experiment (See Additional file : Table S1)  which opens the question on the function of  in ovarian development in pejerrey []. Similar results have been reported in reptiles with TSD [  –]. In red-eared slider turtle () embryos  expression of  in the gonads is up-regulated with a large difference between embryos reared at FPT and at MPT  which indicates that  is necessary for male development []. In addition  if the eggshells of developing  embryos are treated with estrogen before the thermosensitive period   expression is inhibited during this period []. Suzuki et al. [] also found that the level of  expression is very low (even undetectable) in testes treated with 17ß-estradiol (E  natural estrogen) compared to control untreated testes. In zebrafish  exposure of larvae to environmentally relevant concentrations of 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE  synthetic estrogen) suppresses  expression during gonad differentiation []. To our knowledge  there is no evidence on the possible implication of exogenous estrogen treatment on  expression in the induction of sex reversal in fish species with TSD. Taken together  these data strongly indicate that  is involved in testis formation and differentiation  and that its expression is sensitive to both temperature and estrogen in turtles with TSD and fish species with GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE. Fernandino et al. [] reported that the expression level of  was not proportional to exposure temperature []  which suggests that other genes/factors acting as sex inducers and located upstream of  are involved in the transduction of temperature and the gonad differentiation cascade. As in turtles  it is assumed that  still holds the capacity of being a master sex-determining gene in several species with GSD and that it can probably be directly modulated by temperature in species with TSD []. Medaka  which is a widely used research model  did not pass the criteria to be diagnosed as a true case of species with TSD because the temperature that causes sex reversal is not within the range of temperatures to which medaka are exposed during the development in the wild []. Incubation of medaka at a high temperature (><U+2009>30°C) induces sex reversal from genotypic (XX) females to phenotypic males and 100% males are obtained at 34°C [  ]  which means that the sex ratio in medaka is genetically determined with strong temperature effects (GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE). During the temperature-dependent sex reversal of medaka  substantial amounts of  mRNA were detected in six of 12 XX embryos incubated at 32°C but not at the “sexually neutral” temperature of 25°C. Thus  the expression of  could be considered as a marker of sex reversal. This is in a good agreement with the results reported by Hattori et al. [] who observed 40% of sex-reversed males at 32°C  which confirms that  may have an essential role in temperature-dependent sex reversal from genetic females to phenotypic males. However  other studies on medaka reported that  was expressed at very low levels up to 15-20 days post-hatching (DPH)  irrespective of the genetic sex [  ]. These results lead us to raise two relevant questions: (1) does a high temperature accelerate the cascade of molecular events that lead to testis differentiation (but not ovarian differentiation) and result in earlier expression of ? and (2) is the sex-specific (32°C  embryogenesis) vs. non-sex-specific (possibly 25°C  after hatching) expression of  due to the influence of incubation at high-temperature or is it necessary for natural ovary development? More studies on  expression at various developmental temperatures are necessary to clarify these questions and to understand how this gene contributes to the fate  development  and/or maintenance of the testis as well as the ovary in fish species. It has been reported that in European sea bass that has GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE  the expression level of  mRNA increased continuously in differentiating and differentiated testes between 150 and 300 DPH  while in adult ovaries it increased until 200 DPH and then decreased to an undetectable level []  which means that  is not necessary for ovarian maintenance in this fish species. The delayed expression of  suggested that it is neither involved in the formation of the undifferentiated gonad (formed around 90 DPH)  nor in the high-temperature induced masculinization mechanism. In contrast  in the Nile tilapia in which the sex ratio is genetically determined with strong temperature effects   expression presented a rapid up-regulation pattern during the critical period of sex differentiation at high temperature in both the XY and XX male population []  which implies that in this species  is involved in testicular differentiation and high-temperature induced sex reversal. In the pufferfish ()   appears to be involved in the degeneration of germ cells in the ovary  which in turn  causes ovary to testis sex reversal induced by high-temperature exposure during the early development of gonads []. Based on the results of the literature on gene expression patterns and on the pathways involved in temperature-induced sex reversal from XX females to phenotypic males in Nile tilapia  we propose a scheme that depicts the putative male pathway induced by high-temperature/MPT (Figure ). However  how temperature triggers the sex determination of undifferentiated gonads remains to be investigated.  Relationships drawn with solid lines are reported/ demonstrated; dotted lines are putative pathways; arrows indicate up-regulations and lines with dots indicate down-regulations; MPT: male-producing temperature; TSP: thermosensitive period of gonads; DPH: days post-hatching; :  gene; :  gene; : sry-related HMG-box protein 9 gene; :  gene; : ovarian  gene; data refer to D'Cotta et al. []  Ijiri et al. []  Baroiller et al. [] and Wang et al. [  ]. In spite of the diverse and seemingly paradoxical expression patterns of  found among different types of sex determination systems involved in temperature-dependent sex reversal  it is clear that  plays an essential role in testis differentiation and in the temperature signal transduction pathway to the gonad at least in fish species with TSD  and that the up-regulation of  expression is correlated with the temperature-induced male phenotype. Nevertheless  further studies are necessary to elucidate all the mechanisms that involve the  gene. Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH)  also known as müllerian-inhibitory substance (MIS)  belongs to the transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) family and is secreted by the Sertoli cells. It is responsible for the regression of Müllerian ducts during male fetal development in mammals  birds  and reptiles [–] and is involved in both early sex determination and later gonadal development in higher vertebrate species []. Although teleost species do not have Müllerian ducts  dimorphic expression of  was detected in developing and/or adult gonads and  seems to play a role in gonadal differentiation and maintenance of both sexes. For example  in Japanese flounder []  zebrafish [  ]  Atlantic salmon [] and  complex []   is initially expressed at low levels in the undifferentiated gonads of both sexes and then at higher levels in the testis compared to the ovary during sex differentiation. In medaka  however  this is not the case since from hatching to adult  no sex-specific difference of  expression was found []. In reptiles with TSD   has been studied in the red-eared slider turtle () and the American alligator (). In the red-eared slider turtle  expression analyses in both AKG (adrenal-kidney-gonad) complexes and isolated gonads showed that the levels of  expression were higher at MPT than at FTP early in the bipotential gonad and throughout gonadogenesis [  ]. Moreover   expression decreased rapidly in gonads shifted from MPT to FPT but not in gonads shifted from FPT to MPT  which suggests that a testis-specific function is repressed and that expression of  is modulated by temperature. In the American alligator  expression of  was only detected in the developing testis of embryos incubated at MPT but not at FPT []. The dimorphic expression of  in reptiles suggests that it is involved in temperature-dependent sex determination/differentiation although the mechanism remains unclear. To our knowledge  the expression level of  has been investigated in only one fish species with TSD  i.e. pejerrey () []  in which it is much higher at MPT than at FTP and increases dramatically during gonad differentiation. In addition  a significant increase in  expression is observed in putative males at MPT and at MixPT approximately one week before the first morphological signs of testis differentiation  which is similar to the expression profile in reptiles with TSD. However  the expression level of  was comparable in putative males at MPT and at MixPT and in putative females at FPT and at MixPT  which indicates that  in this fish species  temperature does not modulate directly the expression of  and thus that the expression of  is the consequence rather than the cause of gonad sex differentiation. Thus  other gene(s) or sex inducer(s) are involved in the regulation of gonad sex differentiation in this fish species. Furthermore  it is assumed that  expression is regulated by the level of 17ß-estradiol and thus that  is involved in this regulation []. In zebrafish  Schulz et al. [] reported that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of 17ß-estradiol during early life suppressed both  and  expression  which was associated with cessation or retardation of testis development. It is interesting to note that a Y-linked  duplicated copy  termed  is supposed to be a master male determining gene in the Patagonian pejerrey () []  which is generally regarded as a species with TSD. The gene  was located on a single metacentric/submetacentric chromosome in XY individuals and was found to be expressed much earlier than the autosomal form of  (6 days post-fertilization vs. 12 weeks post-fertilization). Furthermore   knockdown in XY Patagonian pejerrey embryos results in the up-regulation of  and  mRNA and the development of ovaries. In the protandrous fish species  black porgy ()  expression patterns of  during development and in the adult gonad indicate that  plays important roles in early gonadal development in both sexes and later in ovary growth and natural sex change []. The  gene appears to have lost part of its functions and to have acquired new ones  which are involved in sex determination and sex differentiation  during the vertebrate evolution from teleost fish to mammals. It will be interesting to compare the expression profile of  in fish species with TSD and GSD  or fish species with different levels of TSD (varying levels of sex ratio response to temperature  e.g. Atlantic silverside) before and during sex differentiation and in different temperature conditions to address the adaptation of species with TSD. We expect that  in the near future  duplicated copies of other downstream genes involved in sex determination (e.g. ) will be identified and shown to have essential roles in this mechanism. The gene  is the direct target of the mammalian sex-determining factor SRY []. SOX9 and SRY belong to the same family of HMG-box containing transcription factors. SOX9 is a male determining factor both necessary and sufficient for testis formation in mammals. In mice [  ] and humans [  ]  loss of  results in male to female sex reversal  while transgenic XX mice that carry a copy of the  gene develop into phenotypic males [  ]. Extensively investigated  the function of  is known to be critical for many aspects of cell differentiation such as heart valve development  neural crest differentiation  chondrocyte specification and male sex determination in mammals [–]. Many of these functions have been demonstrated in various vertebrates  which suggests that the  gene is conserved both structurally and functionally. In several reptiles with TSD   was shown to be expressed at higher levels in gonads at MPT than at FPT []. The comparison of expression profiles of  at FPT  MPT  and temperature transfer (FPT to MPT) in reptiles indicates that  may not be involved in the initial steps of sex determination as in mammals. However  a study on turtles  suggested that its function may be critical for final commitment to a testicular fate []. Because of its important and widespread functions  of the ambiguous classification of its orthologs and of the role of its duplication and divergence during the evolution of tetrapod and teleost lineages  most of the studies on the  gene have focused on these aspects rather than on its role in gonadal determination and differentiation in fish species. The  gene is present in two copies (known as    or   ) in most of the fish species studied i.e. medaka  rice field eel  stickleback  zebrafish  fugu and rainbow trout [–] as a result of the teleost-specific genome duplication  except in sturgeon () [  ]. The expression pattern of  co-orthologs is more complicated in teleost fish. Without taking into account the ambiguous nomenclature of  orthologs  the expression patterns and functions of  and  are likely to be diverse in different fish species in terms of gonadal formation and development (Table ). Combined with data on reptiles  it seems that  or  plays a conserved role in gonadal development in non-mammalian species (Table ). In medaka  during early sex differentiation of the gonads  / was found to be expressed in the somatic cells surrounding germ cells at comparable levels in both sexes  which suggested that / is involved in the later development of testis rather than in the early sex determination and differentiation []. In addition  a recent highly interesting study that analyzed  medaka mutants demonstrated that  is not required in testis determination but is indispensable for the proper proliferation and survival of germ cells in both female and male medaka gonads []. Another study on air-breathing catfish () showed that  was specifically expressed in the developing and adult testis whereas  was preferentially expressed in the developing and adult ovary  which confirms that  has conserved its function in the testis regarding spermatogenesis while  could play a new role in the ovary similar to that in zebrafish (Table ) [      ]. Surprisingly  when catfish individuals were treated with an androgen (11-KT)  the level of  transcripts increased significantly in adult testicular slices but the mechanism remains to be elucidated []. Another interesting report in rice field eel ()  which undergoes natural sex reversal from females to males  suggested that the double dose of the  genes ( and ) may play a role in gonadal differentiation from female to intersex to testis during sex reversal []. In Nile tilapia []  it was shown that the testis-specific expression of  only occurred in the later stages of testis differentiation  which supports the hypothesis that  is involved in testis formation rather than in male determination or differentiation. Another study also on Nile tilapia [] reported that  was strongly expressed in the high-temperature-treated females as early as 12 days post-fertilization (before the first signs of morphological differentiation  Figure ) and was up-regulated thereafter  which indicates that  participates in the temperature-dependent masculinization process. Future work should be aimed at investigating the function of  in sex commitment in fish species and its divergence during the vertebrate evolution from teleost fish to mammals. Due to the important role of estrogen in development  growth and reproduction in teleost fish  aromatase  which is the key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of estrogen from androgen  has been extensively analyzed in the undifferentiated  differentiating  and differentiated gonads as well as in adult fish [  ]. The gene that encodes aromatase is a duplicated gene in all investigated teleost fish [–]  except in the eel which belongs to the ancient group of Elopomorpha []. The gene duplication gave rise to two different genes (isoforms)  namely  and   in most teleost fish. The  gene is also known as “” or “” (also referred to as    or ) since it is mainly expressed in the differentiating and adult gonad of teleost fish. The  gene is called the “” or “” (also referred as    or ) since it is highly expressed in the brain of both male and female teleost species [] but no sexually dimorphic brain expression during gonad sex differentiation has been demonstrated []. Our review of the literature is restricted to studies on the ovarian gene () with regard to sex differentiation. Expression of  has been detected prior to sex differentiation in all fish species investigated and is associated with temperature-induced sex reversal (See Additional file : Table S1). Kitano et al. [] have studied the Japanese flounder ()  in which sex is genetically determined with strong temperature effects since high temperatures induced an all-male population from an all-female population. They reported that  in this species  the expression of  mRNA was the same between males and females during the sex-undifferentiated period up to 50 DPH but that 10 days later when gonads start to differentiate  a specific expression was detected in the females. The level of  expression increased rapidly in the female group but decreased slowly in the male group. A subsequent study conducted by the same team on Japanese flounder showed that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) signaling and FOXL2 are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the  gene during gonad sex differentiation []. These results indicate that  is involved in temperature-induced sex reversal and plays an essential role in ovarian differentiation. However  it seems that  is a downstream gene in the sex differentiation pathway and thus  other upstream genes probably trigger the development of the undifferentiated gonads to ovaries or testes in natural sex differentiation or temperature-induced sex differentiation. In Nile tilapia  in which high temperature causes 100% masculinization  the difference in  expression between sexes (higher in females than in males) was shown to exist before the histological differentiation of the ovary and to occur when germ cells enter meiosis []. Furthermore  the expression of  followed an interesting pattern: higher in all-female (27°C) than in all-female (35°C) than in all-male (27°C) than in all-male (35°C)  which indicates that  is involved in the high-temperature induced masculinization (See Additional file : Table S1). Similar results were also observed in Atlantic Halibut () in which expression levels of  were lower before sex differentiation (13°C<U+2009><<U+2009>10°C<U+2009><<U+2009>7°C) in the high-temperature treatment group []. In addition  the expression of  increased in the low-temperature group (7°C) compared to the higher-temperature groups. However  in European sea bass ()  no significant difference in the expression of  was detected between MPT and FPT prior to and during sex differentiation (See Additional file : Table S1)  although the proportion of males was 73% in the high-temperature group compared to 23% in the low-temperature groups [  ]. In Nile tilapia   was found to strongly activate the transcription of  by binding to the sequence ACAAATA in the promoter region of the  gene directly through its forkhead domain in  and in  studies []. In a subsequent study by Navarro-Martín et al. [] in the European sea bass  methylation of the  promoter activated by high-temperature resulted in a lower expression of  in temperature-masculinized fish  by preventing binding of  and  to their sites  and in turn  blocking transcriptional activation of   which agreed with previous studies on  and [–]. Interestingly  in Nile tilapia  the suppressive effect of  on  expression was confirmed  and  via the repression of the activity of Ad4BP/  which suggests that  suppressed the female pathway by repressing the transcription of the  gene and production of estrogen in the gonads []. In summary  in temperature-dependent sex determination of phenotypic males  temperature-induced methylation of the  promoter or temperature-induced high expression of  are the cause of the down-regulation of  expression and the subsequent low level of estrogen. However  the status and relationship between  and methylation of the  promoter are unclear and  is probably not the direct target of temperature. To our knowledge  in fish species  expression of  is generally thought to respond to temperature  namely  it is repressed with increasing temperatures (See Additional file : Table S1)  which agrees well with the single sex ratio pattern dependent on temperature proposed by Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer []. It could be argued that  suppression is the consequence rather than the cause of the suppression of female development. Nevertheless   could be a good “indicator” to differentiate females from males prior to and/or during sex differentiation in some fish species. Undoubtedly   plays an important role in sex differentiation in fish species. FOXL2 is a forkhead domain transcription factor  which is required for granulosa cell differentiation and ovarian maintenance []. Mutations of the  gene are responsible for blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome characterized by a distinctive eyelid abnormality and premature ovarian failure []. During the past decade  many studies have investigated the expression profiles of   its targets and its signaling pathway from mammals to teleosts and confirmed its pivotal role in the development and maintenance of female sexual characteristics. Human FOXL2 and SF-1 (SF-1 is a steroidogenic factor-1  also known as Ad4BP and officially designated NR5A1) proteins interact in ovarian granulosa cells i.e. FOXL2 down-regulates the transcriptional activation of the steroidogenic enzyme  CYP17  through SF-1 []. Furthermore  patients with blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome type I present mutations in the  gene that result in the loss of the ability to suppress the induction of  mediated by SF-1. This demonstrates that mutations in the  gene are responsible for the disruption of normal ovarian follicle development. In goats  FOXL2 has been shown to be a direct transcriptional activator of the  gene via its ovarian-specific promoter 2 []. Goats with polled intersex syndrome in which the function of  is disrupted have a reduced expression of aromatase compared to control animals [  ]. The phenotype of  knockout mice comprises total absence of secondary follicles and oocyte atresia [  ] and mouse XX gonads without  develop into males []  which suggests that  represses the male pathway during female gonadal development. For more details on the  function in ovarian development in mammals  refer to the review by Uhlenhaut and Treier []. To date  in fish species  analyses of the expression of  reveal a sex-specific pattern and a positive correlation with the expression of  (Table ). In particular  it has been reported in Nile tilapia  that  can directly activate the transcription of  and also interact with  to strengthen the  mediated  transcription []. Moreover  disruption of the endogenous  gene in XX tilapia individuals induces occasional sex reversal from ovary to testis with a down-regulated expression of  and reduced serum levels of 17ß-estradiol. In Japanese flounder  it is hypothesized that  may directly induce the expression of []. On the contrary  in medaka in which there is a significant delay between the onsets of the expressions of  and   expression of  alone may not be sufficient to induce expression of  and other factors might be involved []. In rainbow trout [] and southern catfish []  treatment with 17ß-estradiol up-regulates the expression of  while exposure to an aromatase inhibitor suppresses it  which suggests that the expression of  is regulated through a feedback mechanism of downstream hormones. Taken together these results indicate that  plays a key role in female gonadal differentiation and maintenance through the activation of  and subsequent estrogen synthesis. In Japanese flounder  in which there is complete sex-reversal from males to females or from females to males by exposure to high (27°C) or low (18°C) temperatures during TSP respectively []  expression of  in the gonads is suppressed at high temperature []. This indicates that  may also act as a female determinant in fish species with TSD. Pathways other than the classical sex differentiation pathways have been reported to be associated with sex differentiation in fish species with TSD or GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE during the past decades. The heat shock protein (HSP70) family includes multiple members  which may reflect the evolutionary potential of fish species for adapting to changes in the environment and in particular to physiological modifications linked with sex reversal. In the swamp eel ()  the expression pattern of one member of the HSP70 family  HSPA8B2  mainly detected in the testis supports the gene  as a candidate in gonadal development/spermatogenesis []. Rissanen et al. [] reported that  in crucian carp  hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1  a master regulator of hypoxia-induced gene responses  was involved in the control of the gene’s responses to both oxygen and temperature  which may indicate that it participates in sex differentiation since hypoxia disrupts primordial germ cell migration and influences sex differentiation. Because the amount of information on these novel pathways is quite limited  we focused our review on the cortisol-mediated pathway and the epigenetic regulatory pathway. Hormones are considered as the primary communicators between external conditions and physiological activities because environmental information must first be transduced into a physiological signal to influence sex ratio []. As early as 1985  van den Hurk and van Oordt found [] that  in rainbow trout larvae  exposure to cortisol and cortisone inhibited ovarian growth and increased the proportion of males. Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid produced by the interrenal cells and is used as an important indicator of stress since its production is increased by stressors such as handling  acid water and rapid temperature changes in fish []. Cortisol regulates a diverse array of systems including metabolism  ion regulation  growth and reproduction []. In recent years  several studies reported that exposure to high temperature elevated cortisol levels and led to the masculinization of fish species with TSD and GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE. In 2010  Hayashi et al. [] reported that  in medaka  exposure to a high-temperature (33°C) induced masculinization of XX females by elevating the cortisol level  which  in turn  suppressed germ cell proliferation and expression of  mRNA. Thus  cortisol can cause female-to-male sex reversal in this species. In Pejerrey  a fish species with TSD  individuals treated with cortisol presented elevated levels of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and testosterone and typical molecular signatures of masculinization including up-regulation of  expression and down-regulation of  expression []. Moreover  in the same species  it was observed that during high-temperature-induced masculinization  cortisol promoted the production of 11-KT by modulating the expression of . Cortisol also produces a dose-dependent sex reversal from females to males in the southern flounder () i.e. exposure to high (28°C) and low (18°C) temperatures produced a preponderance of males while an intermediate temperature (23°C) favored a 1:1 sex ratio []. In addition  in the Japanese flounder  exposure to cortisol caused masculinization by directly suppressing the expression of  mRNA by disrupting cAMP-mediated activation []. These results provide evidence on the relationships between temperature conditions and the responses of the organism and allow us to draw a picture of the endocrine-stress axis in terms of gonadal fate under temperature effects. They suggest that cortisol may be the “lost” link between temperature and the sex-determining mechanism in species with TSD and may  as a stressor indicator  be involved in the adaptive modification of sex ratio in a spatially and temporally variable environment during the evolution of such species. The relation between glucocorticoid production and androgen production during the masculinization process should be further investigated. Epigenetics  a “hot spot” area of biology  is the focus of many studies. Epigenetics is defined as “the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence” []. Epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of gene expression typically include DNA methylation  which is relatively well-documented  modification of histones and histone variants  and presence of non-coding RNAs []. Gorelick [] predicted that different methylation patterns of virtually identical sex chromosomes in species with TSD could be the result of small environmental changes (e.g. temperature variation)  thereby determining the sex of each individual. He also hypothesized that homomorphic sex chromosomes are required to explain the origin of TSD; sex differences are initially determined by the different methylation patterns of nuclear DNA in females and males  which result in different sexual phenotypes of TSD. Based on an analysis on European sea bass  a fish with a polygenic system of sex determination in which genetics and temperature contribute almost equally to the sexual phenotype [  ]  Navarro-Martín et al. [] reported that the methylation levels of the promoter of the gonadal  gene are sex-specific and influenced by the temperature at which one-year-old juveniles are reared. The inverse relationship between methylation levels and  expression indicates that temperature-induced masculinization (high-temperature) involves DNA methylation-mediated control of . These findings are the first example of an epigenetic mechanism that regulates temperature effects on sex ratios in a vertebrate. Recently  similar but slightly different results were also found in red-eared slider turtle  a species with clear TSD []. DNA methylation levels of the promoter region of the  gene were significantly higher in embryonic gonads at the male-producing temperature (26°C) than at the female-producing temperature (31°C). Nevertheless  a switch from male-to-female rather than from female-to-male producing temperature during TSP significantly decreased the level of DNA methylation of the  promoter region in the gonads. These results indicate that temperature  specifically female-producing temperature  causes demethylation of the  promoter region which  in turn  leads to the temperature-specific expression of  and favors the female pathway. Moreover  in the protandrous fish species  black porgy ()  it has been reported that the methylation level of the  promoter was higher in inactive ovaries than in active ones  which suggests that the expression of  is controlled by an epigenetic mechanism in addition to the classical transcriptional activators of  such as SF-1 and FOXL2 []. Based on these studies  it is tempting to speculate that methylation of the  promoter may participate in the mechanism that links environmental temperature and sex ratios in vertebrate species with TSD but future research is necessary to support this hypothesis. In 2013  Piferrer published an extensive review on the epigenetic regulation of sex determination and gonadogenesis []. It would be very interesting to investigate whether the methylation patterns of related genes are conserved in vertebrates with different sex-determining mechanisms including GSD  TSD  as well as hermaphrodite species. We believe that the epigenetic regulation of sex determination and differentiation should be extensively studied in many vertebrates and that such studies would provide new insights on our present understanding of the origin  evolution  and maintenance of sex-determining mechanisms. During the past two decades  temperature effects on sexual fate have received much attention. Temperature-dependent sex differentiation in fish species with GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE  which is considered as environmental sex reversal (ESR)  has been well evaluated in terms of population dynamics but the effects in the natural environment are poorly understood. Temperature-dependent sex differentiation (using Trojan sex chromosome  TSC) is used to produce mono-sex populations in aquaculture [  ]  to selectively breed one sex by increasing the proportion of individuals with the desired sex via exposure to a given temperature [  ] and to promote the conservation of small and endangered populations  and the biological control of invasive/introduced species (see reference below). The genetic risk associated with stock enhancement of fish with TSD  for example in the Japanese flounder  []  or the consequences of ESR induced by climate changes (temperature variation) on populations []  have been theoretically evaluated. Here  we examine the possibility of applying selective breeding to increase the proportion of individuals with the desired sex via temperature treatment  summarize briefly the consequences of the existence of the so-called Trojan sex chromosome in terms of fish population dynamics (specifically the farmed fish species)  and propose our ideas on the adaptation of fish populations to changes in global temperature. Temperature is considered as a consumer- and environment-friendly instrument with applications in selective fish breeding. The first experimental evidence that variation in sex ratio response to temperature can be used in selection designs was obtained in [  ]. Then  parental  strain  and/or population influences (genotype-temperature interactions) of temperature effects on sex ratio were confirmed in several fish species with sexual dimorphic growth patterns  e.g.  bluegill sunfish []  Nile tilapia [  –]  rainbow trout []  European sea bass [] and turbot () []. The proportion of females or males after applying a temperature treatment could be significantly increased by selecting the individuals that responded best in Nile tilapia [  –] and rainbow trout []. These results support the application of this consumer- and environment-friendly method i.e. temperature treatment  in selective breeding of mono-sex populations or populations with a high proportion of individuals with the desired sex. Although the gene(s) responsible for TSD have not been identified  TSD is proven to be a highly evolved trait that responds rapidly to selection rather than a plasticity of the primitive sex-determining mechanism []. The availability and reasonable cost of next-generation sequencing will facilitate the detection of gene(s) responsible for TSD  as well as the identification of sex ratio thermosensitive populations. In Japanese flounder  which has a XX/XY sex-determining system  sex differentiation is greatly influenced by rearing temperature during the thermosensitive period []. High (27°C) or low (18°C) temperatures can produce all-male or all-female populations  respectively. Considering the wide range of rearing temperatures used for Japanese flounder in experimental conditions (12-28°C) [] or in farm conditions (up to 32°C) []  ESR probably occurs in both directions to produce XX males and XY females. Hatchery-based stock enhancement in natural waters could lead to the extermination of the wild population  depending on the sex reversal rate in the hatchery  the relative reproductive success of hatchery fish in the wild and the kind of hatchery broodstock used (wild-born or hatchery-born) []. Although it is generally considered that these changes in living conditions are not sufficiently drastic to lead to the extinction of wild populations  their effects on effective population size and population growth cannot be neglected [    –]. Another case of stock enhancement concerns the rainbow trout for recreational fisheries that results in a considerable number of hatchery fish released into the wild environment. Early maturity of the male rainbow trout compared to the female is a major bottleneck in production of such commercially important fish and selection experiments to increase the proportion of females by applying a temperature treatment are ongoing []. Magerhans et al. [] have reported the production of female- or male-biased progenies under high-temperature treatment (18°C) versus control temperature (12°C) in different populations of rainbow trout []. Thus  ESR females (i.e. XY females) could also be induced in farm hatcheries for this fish species. Introduction of hatchery fish into natural waters of other commercial important fish with TSD or GSD<U+2009>+<U+2009>TE such as carp  Nile tilapia  sockeye salmon ()  chinook salmon ()  European sea bass and southern flounder [    ] should also be evaluated. Moreover  there is strong evidence for the presence of naturally sex-reversed individuals due to change in temperature in grayling (  Salmonidae) from a wild lake [] and in two natural populations of Nile tilapia []. These findings reinforce the idea that ESR (either introduced or naturally induced) should be extensively evaluated. Fish population stability and sustainability are realistic issues in natural waters since there is a general consensus on global warming and occurrence of temperature-induced sex reversal in fish species. In 2008  Ospina-Álvarez and Piferrer [] performed simulations to predict sex ratio shifts with temperature increases from +1.5°C to +4°C  and reported a shift from 61.7% to 78.0% of males. Moreover  the mean temperature of natural waters is projected to increase by up to ~4°C by the end of this century according to plausible global change scenarios []  which will certainly affect sex ratios. Field studies on turtles [] and sea turtles [] reported significantly skewed sex ratios with modest temperature changes of 1 to 2°C. In Atlantic silverside  observations made on eggs collected from the wild have shown that a difference of 2°C in the rearing temperature during the thermosensitive period can lead to a shift in the proportion of males from 50% to 69% []. The resulting decrease in the proportion of females would probably affect the population structure and the viability of sensitive stocks since the reproduction potential of many fish communities is determined by the number of females available for egg production []. Results from long-term field investigations of grayling in a lake of Switzerland strongly suggest that the sex ratio is correlated with the average temperature that the juvenile fish experienced during their first summer and that temperature change was involved in the decline of the population []. For some researchers  it is possible that sensitive species  including species with TSD  will not be able to adapt fast enough to the changes in temperature due to global warming [  ]  these changes being characterized by their fast pace []. Thus  global temperature fluctuations will have detrimental effects on fish populations  especially the thermosensitive species. However  an experiment in Atlantic silverside showed that TSD could rapidly evolve in response to selection because a balanced sex ratio was reached after 8 to 10 generations by increasing repeatedly the number of individuals with the minority sex in an extreme and constant temperature environment []. This result  although limited to one species  indicates that fish may be able to adapt rapidly to changing temperature conditions. As discussed in this article  descriptive and comparative analyses of mRNA expression patterns have initiated research on candidate genes that participate in sex determination mechanisms  which can be classified into GSD and TSD. However  these studies are not sufficient to have a complete understanding of sex determination in vertebrates and more specifically  it is not known whether up- or down-regulation of related genes are the cause or the consequence for a female or male pathway to be followed during sex differentiation [–]. The hierarchical cascade and interactions of the genes that underlie GSD and TSD need to be thoroughly investigated by analyzing the expression  localization  and most important  the function of the related proteins. Overexpression and knockdown techniques allow us to investigate whether these molecular players are necessary and / or sufficient to explain the fate of sexual direction as already shown for the genes  in fugu []   in Patagonian pejerrey []   in rainbow trout []  and  in medaka [  ] and the genes in other vertebrates [–] (Figure ). The process of sex determination and differentiation in Teleost fish is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and their interactions. TSD is thought to occur when the water temperature experienced by the offspring irreversibly determines its primary sex. GSD occurs when primary sex is determined by the genotype at conception and is thereafter independent of environmental conditions. How and why transitions between TSD and GSD occur is still unclear but very interesting from the evolutionary point of view. So far  only a few candidate genes associated with temperature-induced sex reversal have been studied in fish species. It is assumed that the thermal master switch  which triggers the undifferentiated gonads to follow the male or female pathway  will be the gene(s) that activate the thermosensitive period or specify responses during this developmental time window. In virtue of temperature-dependent sex determination or sex differentiation  some fish species may be able to adapt rapidly to changing temperature conditions. However  certain sensitive species  including species with TSD  may not be able to adapt fast enough to the changes in temperature due to global warming. Thus  global temperature fluctuations will have detrimental effects on fish populations  especially the thermosensitive species. Descriptive and comparative analyses of gene expression patterns are not sufficient to have a complete understanding of sex determination. Hierarchical cascade and interactions of the genes that underlie GSD and TSD need to be thoroughly investigated by analyzing the expression  localization  and most important  the function of the related proteins. Overexpression and knockdown techniques allow us to examine whether these molecular players are necessary and / or sufficient to explain the fate of sexual direction. Fish possess an astonishing diversity of sex determination mechanisms contracting with systems found in mammals and birds  and they provide cheaper and better models for the broad study of mechanisms of sex determination in many cases.

Detection of QTL (quantitative trait loci) was undertaken on 820 meat-type chickens in a F2 cross between D- and D+<U+2009>lines divergently selected on low or high AMEn (apparent metabolizable energy value of diet corrected to 0 nitrogen balance) measured at three weeks in animals fed a low-quality diet. Birds were measured for 13 traits characterizing digestive efficiency (AMEn  coefficients of digestive utilization of starch  lipids  proteins and dry matter (CDUS  CDUL  CDUP  CDUDM))  anatomy of the digestive tract (relative weights of the proventriculus  gizzard and intestine and proventriculus plus gizzard (RPW  RGW  RIW  RPGW)  relative length and density of the intestine (RIL  ID)  ratio of proventriculus and gizzard to intestine weight (PG/I); and body weight at 23 days of age. Animals were genotyped for 6000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) distributed on 28 autosomes  the Z chromosome and one unassigned linkage group. Nine QTL for digestive efficiency traits  11 QTL for anatomy-related traits and two QTL for body weight at 23 days of age were detected. On chromosome 20  two significant QTL at the genome level co-localized for CDUS and CDUDM  i.e. two traits that are highly correlated genetically. Moreover  on chromosome 16  chromosome-wide QTL for AMEn  CDUS  CDUDM and CDUP  on chromosomes 23 and 26  chromosome-wide QTL for CDUS  on chromosomes 16 and 26  co-localized QTL for digestive efficiency and the ratio of intestine length to body weight and on chromosome 27 a chromosome-wide QTL for CDUDM were identified. This study identified several regions of the chicken genome involved in the control of digestive efficiency. Further studies are necessary to identify the underlying genes and to validate these in commercial populations and breeding environments. Feed represents the major cost of production of meat-type chickens i.e. between 55 and 65% depending on the production type []  and this cost has increased regularly in the last years. For example  in France  the mean cost of poultry feed increased by 34% between 2005 and today. This trend will probably continue because to meet the needs of a rising global human population  it will be necessary to increase crop production both for animal and human consumption and  among others  poultry meat production. Increasing the use of alternative feedstuffs would be one way of reducing the competition between human and animal consumption. However  many of the alternative feedstuffs have a relatively low nutritional value  which results in lower production performance and increased animal manure production. One possibility to tackle this problem is to select birds for improved digestive efficiency. In previous studies  laying hens and meat-type chickens have been selected on traits such as feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake (RFI) but the animals were mainly fed with high-quality and easy-to-digest diets [–]. Recently  it was shown that genetic selection on digestive efficiency resulted in improved feed efficiency [  ]  with heritability estimates of the digestibility of energy  proteins  lipids and starch ranging from 0.33 to 0.47. These studies were performed on D+<U+2009>and D- lines that had been divergently selected for high and low digestive efficiency  respectively  and that were measured at three weeks of age after being fed a difficult-to-digest diet. This diet included a high proportion of wheat from the Rialto cultivar  which has been shown to have a poor digestibility []. Digestive efficiency was assessed through the apparent metabolizable energy value of the diet corrected to 0 nitrogen retention (AMEn). After eight generations of selection  the AMEn value of the Rialto wheat diet was found to be 33% higher in D+<U+2009>than in D- birds []. When birds were fed a corn diet that was easier to digest  the differences between D+<U+2009>and D- lines were much smaller but still significant for AMEn and coefficients of digestive utilization  with values 1 to 8% higher in the D+<U+2009>than in the D- line []. These differences in digestive efficiency were associated with changes in the relative sizes of the organs of the digestive tract  i.e. smaller intestines and heavier gizzards in the D+<U+2009>than in the D- line  as well as changes in gastrointestinal motility and transit time (much faster in the D- than in the D+<U+2009>line) [  ]. Non-invasive measurement of digestive efficiency on a large number of animals involves measuring fecal digestibility instead of ileal digestibility  which is time-consuming and requires that animals are kept in cages   in conditions that differ from the current rearing practices. Thus  identification of genetic markers that are involved in the variability of this type of trait would provide valuable tools for marker-assisted selection. Despite the importance of feed efficiency for poultry production  very few QTL (quantitative trait loci) controlling these traits have been detected to date and none were involved in digestive efficiency. In fact  among the 3919 QTL detected so far in poultry (laying hens and broilers)  only 26 are related to feed efficiency (). Furthermore  none of the seven studies reported describe the composition of the diet used or include measurements of digestibility [–]  although it has been shown that the genetic determinism and level of inheritance of digestive efficiency are closely linked to diet composition []. Thus  our aim was to identify QTL controlling digestive efficiency and anatomy of the digestive tract in an F2 cross between the divergent D+<U+2009>and D- chicken lines fed a suboptimal wheat-based diet. The experiment was conducted according to the guidelines of the French Ministry of Agriculture for Animal Research. Chickens from the D+<U+2009>and D- lines that have been divergently selected on high or low AMEn  respectively []  were crossed at generation 8 to produce an F2 design. The F2 generation consisted of 820 animals originating from six sires and 60 F1 dams (30 from the cross between D+<U+2009>males and D- females and 30 from the cross between D- males and D+<U+2009>females). Five batches of chicks were produced between January and June 2010. From hatching to 10 days of age  birds were reared in one group on the floor  and then were transferred into individual cages. Throughout the experiment  birds were fed a diet similar to that used during the selection experiment  which contained 55% Rialto wheat (Table )  except that clinacox replaced robenidine  an anticoccidial drug that has a limited effect on the development of intestinal microbiota [  ]. For all F2 birds  AMEn values of the diet and coefficients of digestive utilization of dry matter (CDUDM)  starch (CDUS)  proteins (CDUP) and lipids (CDUL) were individually measured between 17 and 20 days of age using a method based on total excreta collection  as described by Bourdillon et . []. The age of 17 to 20 days was chosen because it is the median age of a broilers' rearing cycle. Gross energy  lipid  starch  and protein contents of individual freeze-dried excreta were measured for all birds using the Near Infrared Spectroscopy procedure (NIRS  Foss NIRSystems  Inc.  Silver Spring  MD) described by Bastianelli et . [] with calibration data derived from the chemical analysis of 38 excreta samples. At 23 days of age  birds were weighed (BW23) and slaughtered  and the gizzard  proventriculus and small intestine were removed  emptied and weighed. Organ weights relative to body weight  expressed as percentages  were designated RGW  RPW  RPGW and RIW for the gizzard  proventriculus  gizzard plus proventriculus  i.e. the upper part of the digestive tract and intestine  respectively. Intestine length relative to body weight (RIL  in cm.g)  intestine density calculated as the ratio of intestine weight to intestine length (ID  in g.cm)  and the proventriculus plus gizzard to intestine weight ratio (PG/I  g.g) were also calculated. Elementary statistics for these traits are in Table . To optimize marker informativity in the experimental cross  a sample of six F0 and six F1 males was genotyped with 57 636 SNPs using the Illumina Infinium chicken SNP array. The 6000 most informative SNPs were selected using the MarkerSet software [] and were evenly distributed across 28 autosomes  one unassigned linkage group (LGE22C19) and the Z chromosome. They were used to genotype all F0 and F1 individuals and F2 progeny with a dedicated Illumina Infinium custom array. Low quality SNPs (11.1% with a call rate less than 0.99)  SNPs that deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within families (25%) and SNPs that led to inconsistent genotyping relative to pedigree (2.5%) or genetic map (34.3%) information or to both genetic map information and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg rules (27.1%) were discarded from the analysis in order to reduce the risk of erroneous results. Finally  3379 markers remained (Table ). The genetic map was deduced from the physical positions of the SNPs and from the genetic consensus reference map published by Groenen et . []. This set of markers covered 3099.1 cM. QTL detection was carried out with the QTLMap software [] using a half-sib model [  ] with interval mapping based on maximum likelihood estimations []. This model does not make assumptions on the number of QTL alleles segregating in the design. The traits were analyzed separately. Based on a preliminary analysis of variance  some fixed effects were included in the model such as batch (all traits  four levels)  sex (CDUS  CDUP  BW  RGW  RPW  RPGW  RIW  RIL  PG/I  two levels)  rearing cell (CDUP  three levels)  cage row (AMEn  CDUDM  CDUL  CDUP  BW  RGW  RPW  RPGW  RIW  RIL  three levels)  slaughter per half-day (RGW  RPGW  PG/I  ID  two levels)  person in charge of cutting intestinal segments at slaughter (RGW  RPW  RPGW  RIW  RIL  PG/I  ID  seven levels). QTL analyses were performed by comparing the hypothesis of one QTL (H1)  no QTL (H0) to test the segregation of a QTL on each linkage group. For each trait  on each chromosome  the significance threshold at the chromosome-wide level was calculated from the results of 1000 simulations of performance under the null hypothesis  with a trait heritability estimated on our design (Table ). For the most significant QTL  20<U+2009>000 simulations were made to derive the genome-wide -value (P) from the chromosome-wide -value (P) using an approximate Bonferroni correction: where r was the ratio between length of a specific chromosome and length of the genome as considered for QTL detection in Tilquin et []. Confidence intervals for QTL (95%) were estimated using the LOD drop-off method as proposed by Lander and Botstein []. The significance of the QTL effects within each sire family was tested using a Student test  by assuming an equal distribution of the QTL alleles in the progeny. A QTL effect was retained as significant for Student test -values lower than 0.05  and the corresponding sire families were assumed to segregate for this QTL. These familial substitution effects were estimated in families in which significant QTL segregated. To compute the power of the analysis  1000 simulations of phenotypes usnder the hypothesis of one QTL for which all sires were heterozygous with an effect of 0.20 phenotypic standard deviation were carried out. The proportion of simulations with a maximum likelihood ratio test larger than the 5% chromosome-wide empirical threshold was computed as the power of the analysis. The power of detection of our design did not vary significantly between chromosomes and was always higher than 92%  which means that with this design  it was possible to detect a QTL in more than 92% of cases. Nine QTL were detected for digestive efficiency (Table )  11 for anatomy of the digestive tract (Table ) and two for body weight at 23 days of age (Table ). Most QTL for digestive efficiency were identified for CDUDM and CDUS  two traits which are strongly correlated [  ]. Two genome-wide QTL for CDUS and CDUDM were observed at the same position on chromosome 20 (Figure A). Similarly  four chromosome-wide QTL were found in the same region at 0 cM on chromosome 16 for AMEn  CUDS  CDUDM and CUDP. On chromosome 27  a chromosome-wide QTL for coefficient of digestive utilization of dry matter was detected. It should be noted that for QTL identified on chromosomes 20 and 27  the shape of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) curve was the same for all digestive efficiency traits (Figures A and A) although the LRT did not reach significance for all of them.  digestibility traits (AMEn in blue  CDUDM in red  CDUS in green  CDUP in yellow  CDUL in purple).  anatomy of the digestive tract (RGW in dark blue  RPW in dark red  RIW in green  RPGW in purple  PG/I in gold  RIL in light red  ID in light blue).  digestibility traits (AMEn in blue  CDUDM in red  CDUS in green  CDUP in yellow  CDUL in purple).  anatomy of the digestive tract (RGW in dark blue  RPW in dark red  RIW in green  RPGW in purple  PG/I in gold  RIL in light red  ID in light blue). Among the 11 QTL found for anatomy of the digestive tract  four were involved in traits related to the upper part of the tract (i.e. gizzard and proventriculus) on chromosomes 1  6  8 and 21  five in traits related to the lower part of the tract (i.e. small intestine) on chromosomes 8  12  16  18  26  and two in traits related to the ratio between upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract (PG/I) on chromosomes 11 and 21. All these QTL were detected only at the chromosome-wide level. On chromosome 21  a co-localization between a QTL for the relative weight of the upper part of the digestive tract and a QTL for the ratio between upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract was observed. Co-localization of QTL for digestive efficiency and anatomy traits was found only on chromosomes 16 (AMEn  CDUDM  CDUS  CDUP  RIL) and 26 (CDUS and RIL) (Figures A and B).  digestibility traits (AMEn in blue  CDUDM in red  CDUS in green  CDUP in yellow  CDUL in purple).  anatomy of the digestive tract (RGW in dark blue  RPW in dark red  RIW in green  RPGW in purple  PG/I in gold  RIL in light red  ID in light blue). Overall  the magnitude of the effects of QTL ranged from 0.15 to 0.60 phenotypic standard deviation  with the greatest effect found on chromosome 20 for a genome-wide significant QTL. This QTL was significant in most of the sire families of the design (four and five families depending on the traits)  while the effects of the QTL for the other digestive efficiency traits and for body weight were significant in two to five sire families. The 95% confidence interval for the QTL localizations ranged from 2 cM on chromosome 20 (CDUS and CDUDM) and chromosome 12 (ID) to 27 cM on chromosome 23 (CDUS). The intervals tended to be narrower for the most significant QTL. This study is the first to highlight the presence of QTL for digestive efficiency in the chicken. Nine QTL involved in digestive efficiency traits  and 11 QTL in anatomy-related traits were found. Indeed  the power of the study was enhanced both by testing the birds on a low-quality diet  which revealed a high variability among the birds  and by studying a cross between divergent lines. However  it should be noted that except for the QTL on chromosome 20  most of the QTL were only significant at the chromosome level (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  which is probably due to the fact that they are not fixed in the F0 population in which the D+<U+2009>and D- lines have alternate alleles: only three or four of the six F1 sire families were found heterozygous at these QTL. This observation is also consistent with the complexity of digestive efficiency traits which are most probably polygenic traits. Although digestive efficiency assessed by AMEn is one of the components of FCR  it includes many physiological processes such as digestive secretions  absorption  motility and neurohumoral coordination  the roles of which also vary with nutrients. In addition  the weak effects of most QTL suggest polygenic control  except for the QTL that are involved in CUDS on chromosome 20 and RIL on chromosome 16  although the latter was significant in only two families. Since the digestive efficiency of the whole diet depends on the digestive efficiency of each of its nutrients  QTL that control digestive efficiency were found mainly for components of AMEn (mainly CDUS) and not for AMEn itself  in spite of significant and highly positive genetic correlations (0.60 to 0.90). This result was consistent with those of previous QTL studies [–  ] that were focused on FCR and that detected more QTL for components of the FCR  such as feed intake  growth and body composition than for FCR itself  i.e. nine QTL were found for feed conversion ratio but 16 for production traits such as growth or egg production and 13 for body composition. In our study  the largest number of QTL was found for CUDS. Indeed  the major component of the dietary content is starch  which can explain why selection on digestive efficiency affected mostly digestibility of starch. Moreover  digestion of starch probably involves fewer physiological limiting factors than that of other components of the diet  since only a few types of hydrolytic enzymes (a-amylase  maltase  isomaltase) and a very efficient absorption of glucose  the end product  are required. It is generally accepted that the potential for starch hydrolysis in terms of enzyme secretions is very high in chickens []. Thus  the low digestive utilization of starch observed in some birds in this study originated probably from disorders of digestive motility [] or of the coordination between motility and pancreatic secretions. It should be noted that no QTL was detected for the coefficient of digestive utilization of lipids. Although its heritability was similar to that of the other traits  it also depended on an interaction between the bird and its intestinal microbiota  especially on the balance between  and  and between  and  (data not shown). This double contribution of both the bird and its intestinal microbiota to the digestibility of lipids can make QTL detection more difficult. Although the results depended on the nature of the nutrients  we identified two regions that carry QTL for several traits on chromosomes 16 (four QTL) and 20 (two QTLs). All traits related to digestive efficiency showed a peak at these positions but did not reach the significance threshold. This result is in agreement with the strong genetic correlations observed between the different digestive efficiency traits []. However  on chromosomes 23 and 27 neither co-localized QTL nor closely localized QTL were observed  which suggests either that the genetic control varies  at least partially  between traits  or that this result is a false negative. These results cannot be attributed to a lack of power of our design  which exceeded 92% for all QTL. In our study  we did not find any QTL at positions previously reported for feed efficiency traits that were recorded for animals fed a high-quality diet [–]  except for chromosome 16 for which Ewald et . [] published a QTL for feed conversion ratio. However  given the poor precision of this localization on chromosome 16  we cannot exclude the possibility that these two QTL are the same. This general discrepancy between QTL for feed efficiency and digestive efficiency is not surprising. Digestive efficiency is one of the components of feed efficiency that also includes growth rate  body composition  feed intake and heat production. Furthermore  these studies were undertaken with animals fed on high-quality diets  which means that the contribution of digestive efficiency to the variation of the FCR was fairly low. Moreover  another difference is that the chicken used in these earlier studies grew considerably faster than the chickens used in our study. Data for QTL published in the literature and for those from our study were more consistent for traits related to the anatomy of the digestive tract than for digestive efficiency traits. On chromosome 1  we detected a QTL for RPGW at 456 cM  while Gao et . and Nones et . reported overlapping QTL for gizzard weight at a distance of about 50 cM from our QTL but with very large confidence intervals [  ]. Thus  we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the QTL for gizzard weight and the QTL for RPGW are the same. On chromosome 11  the QTL that we detected for PG/I was within the very large confidence interval (0 to 35 cM) reported for the QTL for intestine length by Gao et . []. On chromosome 26  the confidence interval of the QTL for RIL at 37 cM (34–40 cM) did not overlap with the  gene but was still quite close to it; the  gene was found to affect intestine length []. Therefore  the identification of co-localized QTL for gizzard weight and RPGW is not surprising  if one considers that greater intestinal development can be interpreted as an attempt to counterbalance a functional disorder of the gizzard []. On chromosome 26  co-localized QTL for CDUS and relative intestine length were detected  which is consistent with the strong phenotypic differences in gastrointestinal tract morphology observed between D+<U+2009>and D- lines  with a heavier gastric compartment and a lighter small intestine in the D+<U+2009>than in the D- line [    ] and also with the genetic correlations between digestive efficiency and anatomy traits  in particular weight of the intestine []. Identification of the genes that underlie these QTL should make it possible to distinguish between the effect of gene(s) that control both variation in digestive efficiency and gut morphology and a physiological effect of digestive efficiency on gut morphology. Even if QTL have only moderate effects  selection on these traits may result in a significant reduction in production costs. For instance  the QTL for body weight at 23 days of age on chromosome 1 was responsible for a 2.3% increase in body weight. Extrapolating this difference to the whole production cycle results in an increase in body weight of 46 g per chick at 23 days of age which  when multiplied by the number of chickens per year per laying house (around 120 000)  represents an increase of 5520 kg of meat per henhouse and per year. Similarly  increasing starch digestibility by 2.2% (as for the QTL on chromosome 20) could save 4 tons of feed per year per laying house. Based on the fact that feeding chickens on a poor diet increased the genetic variability of the traits of interest  and thus the power of QTL detection  it can be assumed that the QTL detected in this study could also be expressed when birds are fed a more digestible diet. Previous studies showed that the extent of the differences between the D+ and D- lines depended on diet composition []  and that the anatomical differences were not present at hatching [  ]. Thus  animals reacted to the diets while challenged. However  even if reduced  most differences between these lines remained significant when high-quality diets were used [  ]  which suggests that the QTL detected here are also involved in the variations in digestive efficiency observed with more favorable diets. This is consistent with the high and positive genetic correlations between digestive efficiency traits estimated on wheat and corn diets []. Another line of study that should be addressed in the future is the possibility that epigenetic phenomena affect the expression of genes controlling digestive efficiency without changing the positions of the QTL themselves.

The first alternative algorithm continues to use residual updating  but takes advantage of the characteristic that the predictor variables in the model (i.e. the SNP genotypes) take only three different values  and is therefore termed “improved residual updating”.

The RHS-updating algorithm reduced CPU time by 74.5 to 93.0% and memory requirements by 13.1 to 66.4% compared to the original algorithm. The presented RHS-updating algorithm provides an interesting alternative to reduce both computing time and memory requirements for a range of genomic prediction models. Many models have been suggested for genomic prediction (for a review: see []). The computing time required to estimate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) effects varies considerably between models  e.g. []. Computing time depends both on the number of SNPs used and the number of animals in the training dataset. The latter is rapidly increasing  exceeding 15 000 animals in some cases  e.g. []. The number of SNPs used is also increasing rapidly with the availability of high-density SNP panels in cattle with 648 874 and 777 962 SNPs [] and recently  investigations on the use of whole-genome sequence data in genomic prediction have been reported [  ]. These developments emphasize an increasing need to improve the efficiency of genomic prediction models in terms of computing time and memory requirements. To overcome computing limitations  some fast implementations have been reported for genomic prediction models such as BayesA []  BayesB [  ] and Bayesian Lasso []. At the same time  it has been suggested that variable selection methods such as BayesB are required to make optimal use of whole-genome sequence data in genomic prediction []. The number of reports that compare the fast implementation of such variable selection methods to the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based counterparts has thus far been limited  and all of the aforementioned studies were based on simulated data with a limited number of simulated QTL. To enable the comparison of these fast methods to their MCMC based counterparts in real datasets with whole-genome sequence data  efficient implementations of MCMC genomic prediction models are also required. Genomic prediction models can be classified into those that involve implicit estimation of SNP effects (using genomic relationships)  e.g. []  and those that involve explicit estimation of SNP effects []. Genomic prediction models that explicitly estimate SNP effects  commonly perform regression with SNP genotypes as predictor variables []  coded as 0 1 2 or -1 0 1  referring respectively to the homozygous  heterozygous  and the alternative homozygous genotype. The characteristic that the predictor variables can take only three possible values provides an interesting opportunity to reduce the computing time of algorithms to estimate SNP effects. The objective of this paper was to describe two efficient algorithms to estimate SNP effects that take advantage of the characteristic that each predictor variable (SNP genotype) can take only three different values. The efficiency of the two algorithms is compared in terms of memory and computing time requirements to that of a commonly used algorithm that is based on residual updating. In general  the efficiency of algorithms to estimate SNP effects can be improved by avoiding redundant computations. The general conditional genomic prediction model to estimate SNP effects for locus   is: where  is a vector with conditional phenotypes for SNP    is a vector of 1’s   is the overall mean   is a vector with SNP genotypes at locus    is the allele substitution effect for locus   and  is a vector of residuals. Note that elements of  could be simply equal to 0  1  or 2  or take any other value. I.e.  elements of  could be scaled and centred  such that they take the following values:    or   where  is the frequency of the allele at locus  for which the homozygous genotype is coded as 2. Such scaling of the genotype coding is reported to have some numerical advantages when using MCMC methods []. Conditional phenotypes () for SNP  in iteration <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 are defined as phenotypes corrected for estimated effects at all other SNP loci  as []: where  is the number of SNPs included in the model and  is a matrix that stores all genotypes. The conditional mean of the allele substitution effect () for locus  in iteration <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 is obtained as follows: where    is the residual variance  and  is the variance associated with locus . Note that  in equation () can be estimated in several ways  as done in well-known models such as BayesA and BayesB []  BayesC [] or Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection [  ]  or can be assumed to be known as in RR-BLUP [  ]. Note that equation () gives the value required in a Gauss-Seidel algorithm to compute BLUP estimates for the allele substitution effects  while it gives the mean of the conditional posterior density if a Bayesian model is used to estimate the allele substitution effects. Using residual updating  the conditional phenotypes in equation () in iteration <U+2009>+<U+2009>1    can be more efficiently computed as []: where  contains the current residuals  i.e.: Using residual updating  the conditional mean of the allele substitution effect () in iteration <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 can then be obtained per locus as follows []: Considering that  in each iteration  allele substitution effects must be estimated for  loci  using phenotypes of  individuals  computing all conditional phenotypes using equation () requires (-1) multiplications and (-1) subtractions  whereas equation () requires only  multiplications and  summations. After calculating   the residual updating step is finalized by updating all residuals such that they can be used to compute conditional phenotypes for SNP <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 []: Hereafter  the algorithm that uses equations ()  (4) and (5) will be referred to as “original residual updating”. In the original residual updating algorithm  updating of the residuals and obtaining the sum of cross-products of the residuals and genotypes of each individual are the most time-consuming steps []. As indicated by Legarra and Misztal []   can be calculated once and stored in memory. As a result  to compute  using equation ()  <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 multiplications are required. The number of multiplications can be reduced by first summing residuals () across animals with the same genotypes  and then multiplying each of those three sums by the appropriate genotype. Considering this  equation () can be rewritten as: where the  is a vector that contains the (squared) centred and scaled values of the three genotypes that are present at locus    is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector that contains the sum of the residuals for each genotype  at locus   i.e.   and vector  contains the number of animals for each genotype at locus . It should be noted here that   but the notation  is introduced here to clarify implementation in the newly proposed algorithm  as will be shown later. Equation () involves only four multiplications and  thus  requires -3 fewer multiplications than equation () (noting that all values for  can be computed once and stored). Those -3 multiplications are replaced by -3 summations that are computationally less demanding than multiplications using standard Fortran functions. Hereafter  the algorithm that uses equations () and () will be referred to as “improved residual updating”. Further reduction of the number of required computations is possible in the update for locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 by using the residual information that was already calculated in the update of locus : where   i.e. a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>1 vector that contains the sums of the residuals before updating locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 for each genotype  at locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 in iteration <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  and  is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrix that contains the number of animals that have any of the nine combinations of genotypes at loci  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. Note that  can be computed once and stored. The term  is a vector that contains the sum of the residuals for each of the three genotypes  at locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. Each of these sums is computed from the sums of residuals (before updating) for each of the three genotypes  at locus  that were computed within groups of animals having genotype  at locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  i.e. . Thus  for locus   first 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3<U+2009>=<U+2009>9 sums of residuals are calculated  one for each unique combination of genotypes at loci  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. These sums include the residuals before  is used to update them. The update at locus  is accounted for by the term . Implementing equation () in (6) yields: The alternative proposed updating scheme to compute  involves applying equation () instead of (4) or (6) for locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. This updating scheme is hereafter referred to as “right-hand-side updating” (RHS-updating)  since it essentially involves direct updating of the right-hand-sides of the model to estimate the SNP effects  without having to explicitly update the residuals every time a SNP effect is estimated. Instead of explicitly updating residuals after computing the allele substitution effect  the change of the residuals is stored for each possible combination of genotypes at loci  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 as: where  is a 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrix that contains updates to the residuals for each combination of genotypes at loci  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 after computing the allele substitution effects for those loci  and  is a vector of 1’s  such that both 1' and  are 3<U+2009>×<U+2009>3 matrices. After computing  and   residuals for each combination of genotypes at loci  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 can be updated as: where  is the element in  that corresponds to genotype  at locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 and genotype  at locus . Applying equations () and () for locus  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  finalizes the RHS-updating step  just like equation () finalizes the residual updating step. A set of SNPs that is consecutively analysed using RHS-updating  is hereafter referred to as a “RHS-block”. It should be noted that for the first locus within an RHS-block  here referred to as locus   there is no dependency on the previously evaluated locus and therefore equation () reduces to: This can be interpreted as the initialization step where  first  the sums of residuals for all nine RHS-group are computed as  and  second  the sum of residuals for each genotype at locus  is computed as: . Thus  the RHS-updating scheme for “RHS-blocks” of two loci involves the following steps: Apply equation () for locus   Apply equation () for locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  Apply equation () for locus  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  and Apply equation () to update the residuals. This implies that the number of operations for locus  is similar for the residual updating and RHS-updating algorithms. However  for locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  applying equation () requires only 20 summations and subtractions and 11 multiplications  compared to -3 summations and 4 multiplications that are required when applying (6). This indicates that the total number of operations is drastically reduced by the RHS-updating algorithm. Consider that for each pair of loci  groups of animals can be identified that have the same combination of genotypes at those two loci. With regard to the RHS-updating scheme  two important points should be noted. First  the groups within RHS-blocks can be coded such that each group code always contains the same genotypes on the first and second SNP. E.g.  considering that there are 3 groups. At locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  groups 1-3 contain genotype 0  groups 4-6 contain genotype 1  and groups 7-9 contain genotype 2. At locus   groups 1  4 and 7 contain genotype 0  groups 2  5 and 8 contain genotype 1  and groups 3  6 and 9 contain genotype 2. A schematic representation of this group coding within RHS-blocks is in Figure . Using such unique coding for the groups within RHS-blocks implies that genotypes do not need to be stored explicitly in memory  since they are stored implicitly through the group numbers. In the RHS-updating algorithm  the array that stores the group codes was stored as integer(2). In the residual updating algorithms  similarly  per locus and individual  the “codes” of the genotypes were stored in an integer(1) array while for each locus the actual values of the three genotypes were stored separately. In fact  the array storing the genotypes for the residual updating algorithm or the group codes for the RHS-updating algorithm are the largest arrays used in those algorithms  and therefore largely determine the total amount of RAM used. For residual updating  this array is of size <U+2009>×<U+2009> and was stored as integer(1) and the amount of RAM used is therefore expected to be proportional to . For RHS-updating  this array is of size <U+2009>×<U+2009>/  where  is the number of SNPs per RHS-block and was stored as integer(2). The amount of RAM used with RHS-updating is therefore expected to be proportional to /. These simple formulas  adjusted to predict RAM use in Gb (Table )  will be compared to empirically measured RAM use.  Groups are coded 1 to 9; RHS(  ) represents the group within an RHS-block that combines individuals with genotype  at locus  and genotype  at locus <U+2009>+<U+2009>1. The second point that should be noted  is that within the RHS-updating scheme  the initialization step described in equation () is the most time-consuming and is recurrent every two loci. By applying the same principles  the RHS-updating scheme can be also applied to more than two loci consecutively. Increasing the number of loci per RHS-block may decrease the relative cost of the initialization step (10)  but this will be eventually off-set by the exponential increase in the number of groups that is defined per RHS-block  which is equal to 3  where  is the number of SNPs per RHS-block. When the number of loci per RHS-block increases  then at some stage the equivalent expression of equation () becomes computationally more demanding. The optimal value to be used for  likely depends on the number of individuals in the training data () and will be empirically derived in this study. The three algorithms described above  are mathematically equivalent  in the sense that they estimate SNP effects using the same information. Thus  all three algorithms are expected to give the same results. The above updating schemes to estimate SNP effects were implemented for a model that is commonly referred to as Bayes SSVS (Stochastic Search Variable Selection) [  ] that is solved using Gibbs sampling and implemented in a computer program written in Fortran 95. The genomic model is generally described as: where  contains phenotypic records   is the overall mean   is a vector of 1’s   is an <U+2009>×<U+2009> matrix that contains the scaled and centered genotypes of all individuals   contains the (random) allele substitution effects for all loci  and  contains the random residuals. The specific parameterization of the genomic model that results in the Bayes SSVS model is described below. The likelihood of the Bayes SSVS model conditional on all unknowns is assumed to be normal: where  denotes the SNP genotypes of animal . Definitions of the unknowns and their prior distributions are described hereafter. The prior for  was a constant. The residual variance  has a prior distribution of  which yields a flat prior. The prior for  depends on the variance  and the QTL indicator <U+2009>=<U+2009>1: The prior distribution for the indicator variable   is: where  was assigned a value of 0.999  and  has the following prior distribution: where  is the degrees of freedom  set to 4.2 according to [  ]  and the scale parameter  is calculated as  where  is computed as []: where  is the number of loci. The conditional posterior density of a is: where  is the conditional mean of the allele substitution effect at locus   whose computation was explained previously    and The conditional posterior density of  is an inverse-<U+03C7> distribution: where  is a vector with squares of the current estimates of the allele substitution effects of all loci  weighted by vector   which contains values of 1 or 100 for each locus. Finally  the conditional posterior distribution of the QTL-indicator  was (following the notation in []): where 1<U+2009>-<U+2009> () is the prior probability that <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0)    where * contains the conditional phenotypes as defined previously  and (|<U+2009>=<U+2009>d)  where d is either 0 or 1  and is proportional to   where . It should be noted that  depends on  through its dependence on <U+03C9>  i.e. if <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) then <U+03C9><U+2009>=<U+2009>100 (<U+03C9><U+2009>=<U+2009>1). Finally  the conditional posterior density of  is an inverse-<U+03C7> distribution: where  is the number of animals with records and  is a vector with the current residuals. To investigate to what extent the CPU time of the newly developed algorithms depended on the number of individuals included in the analysis  a dataset of 420 SNPs was simulated. The number of SNPs was limited to 420  to reduce total computation time  and this limited number of SNPs was sufficient to compare the relative computation time of the different algorithms because total CPU time scales linearly with the number of SNPs. Further details of the simulation are not included here because the aim of the subsequent analysis was only to compare CPU time. The size of the dataset was increased with steps of 500 individuals from 500 to 100 000 individuals and each dataset was analysed 11 times. The newly developed RHS-updating algorithm was used in nine of those analyses  using one to nine SNPs per RHS-block. The tenth analysis was an implementation using original residual updating. The eleventh analysis implemented improved residual updating. Each analysis was run for 900 iterations  and the CPU time for these 900 iterations was recorded. To investigate to what extent the required amount of RAM of the newly developed algorithm depended on the number of individuals in the analysis  a dataset of 50 000 SNPs was simulated. The number of individuals was increased in steps of 5000 individuals from 500 to 95 500 individuals. This number of SNPs and animals yielded a range of datasets with dimensions that corresponded to the size of currently used practical datasets and each dataset was analysed 11 times. These analyses involved the same models and settings as used to evaluate CPU time. Each analysis was run until the iterations started  i.e. when the maximum RAM requirement was reached  at which point the used RAM was recorded and the process was aborted. The maximum RAM requirement was measured by retrieving the process ID and then storing the RAM use for that process. Details of this procedure are provided in the Appendix 1. All comparisons were run on a Windows XP-64 desktop pc with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) 64-bit CPU E5420 with a clock speed of 2.50 GHz. Comparisons on CPU time were also run on a Linux platform with an AMD Opteron 8431 64-bit CPU with a clock speed of 2.39 GHz running Ubuntu 12.04.3. The programs were compiled with the Intel® Fortran Compiler 11.0.075 for Windows and the Intel® Fortran Compiler 13.0.079 for Linux. The required CPU time on the Windows workstation for the RHS-updating algorithm depended strongly on the number of SNPs included per RHS-block (Figure ). In all cases  including more than six SNPs per RHS-block resulted in a longer CPU time. Conversely  including less than four or five SNPs per RHS-block also resulted in a longer CPU time  especially when the number of individuals was large. The solid line in Figure  shows that the optimal number of SNPs included per RHS-block that results in the lowest CPU time  changed with the number of individuals in the analysis. This is further illustrated in Figure   where the actual number of SNPs that gave the minimum CPU time is plotted against the number of individuals in the analysis. Although there was a clear trend  across the number of individuals  especially with a larger number of individuals  there was no exact threshold when either five or six SNPs were included per RHS-block  which indicates that there was very little difference in CPU time when five or six SNPs were used. Similar trends in CPU time were observed when running the analysis on the Linux server  for which slightly longer CPU times were generally observed (Figure ). Nevertheless  with our implementation of RHS-updating  it appears to be appropriate to include two SNPs when the number of individuals is less than 1000  three SNPs when it is between 1000 and 2500  four SNPs when it is between 2500 and 11 000  five SNPs when it is between 11 000 and 50 000  and six SNPs when it is between 50 000 and 100 000.  The reported time is for Gibbs chains of 900 iterations; the algorithm used one to nine SNPs per RHS-block  and the data contained 420 SNPs and an increasing number of individuals (500 to 100 000); the black line is the fitted curve through the number of SNPs that gave the minimum CPU time.  Minimum computing time was evaluated for an increasing number of individuals (500 to 100 000).  The reported time is for Gibbs chains of 900 iterations; the algorithm used one to nine SNPs per RHS-block  and the data contained 420 SNPs and an increasing number of individuals (500 to 100 000); the black line is the fitted curve through the number of SNP that gave the minimum CPU time. The CPU time for the Gibbs chain using the optimal number of SNPs per RHS-block was compared to the CPU time of the original and improved residual updating schemes across the different numbers of animals included in the analysis (Figure ). Compared to original residual updating  improved residual updating reduced CPU time on the Windows workstation by 35.3 to 43.3%  and RHS-updating reduced CPU time by 74.5 to 93.0%. Improvements in terms of CPU time were similar for the Linux server (results not shown). The required CPU time for pre-processing the data was slightly larger for the RHS-updating versus the residual updating algorithm. On the Windows workstation  for the dataset with 95 500 animals and 50 000 SNPs  the time to transform the SNP data into the (integer) coding  required 954 s and 1217 s  respectively  for the residual updating and the RHS-updating algorithm. These results show that  although most of the reduction in CPU time achieved by RHS-updating originated from evaluating SNPs within RHS-blocks rather than individually  at the same time  the first step to implement improved residual updating already makes an important contribution to the reduction in CPU time.  CPU time for a Gibbs chain of 900 iterations was evaluated for 420 SNPs and an increasing number of individuals (500 to 100 000); the reported CPU time for the RHS-updating scheme is the minimum computing time of nine analyses that include one to nine SNPs per RHS-block  for each number of individuals. The required amount of RAM for the RHS-updating algorithm also depended on the number of SNPs included per RHS-block (Figure ). In nearly all cases  including more than six SNPs per RHS-block resulted in more RAM used. Conversely  including less than three to six SNPs per RHS-block also resulted in more RAM used  especially when the number of individuals was large. The pattern in RAM use (Figure )  changed with the number of individuals in the dataset  in a pattern that was quite similar to that of the CPU time. This implies that choosing an optimal number of SNPs per RHS-block based on required CPU time  yields an algorithm that is also close to optimal in terms of RAM use.  RAM use was evaluated for 50 000 SNPs and an increasing number of individuals (500 to 95 500). In Figure   the amount of RAM used is plotted for all three algorithms  for datasets with 50 000 SNPs and 500 to 95 500 individuals. Note that both residual updating algorithms required about the same amount of RAM  therefore only one curve was plotted for residual updating. In the case of RHS-updating  for each number of individuals  either the number of SNPs per RHS-block that gave the minimum CPU time or the number that gave the minimum amount of required RAM was used. Both sets of numbers of SNPs per RHS-block gave very similar answers. Compared to the residual updating schemes  the reduction in required RAM for RHS-updating ranged from 13.1 to 66.4%.  For RHS-updating  the number of SNPs per RHS-block was set to the number that gave either the minimum computing time (min. time) or the minimum RAM requirement (min. RAM); RAM use was evaluated on a Windows workstation for a dataset with 50 000 SNPs and for an increasing number of individuals (500 to 95 500); note that only one curve is plotted for residual updating  because both residual updating algorithms require practically the same amount of RAM. As shown in Figure   for a fixed number of SNPs  the RAM use of the residual updating and the RHS-updating algorithms were linearly related to the number of animals included. This agrees with the derived formulas for expected RAM use in Table . The ability of those equations to predict measured RAM use  was investigated by regressing measured RAM use on predicted RAM use for each method  based on datasets containing 50 000 SNPs and 500 to 95 500 animals. The results of those regressions are presented in Table  and show that the equations predicted RAM use with an R value of 1.0 in all cases. The intercepts of the regression generally had a positive value  indicating that the prediction equation missed only a small proportion of the used RAM. This value became substantial for the RHS-updating algorithm when the number of SNPs per RHS-block was equal to 7 or more because  e.g.  the relative size of the array that stores the number of individuals for each RHS-group increases considerably when the number of RHS-blocks increases. Two alternative algorithms were presented that can be implemented in various genomic prediction models for fast computing of SNP effects. The algorithms replace the originally suggested residual updating algorithm []  without affecting the results obtained. Differences in results between algorithms were similar to those within algorithms when using different random seeds and correlations between different sets of results were greater than 0.99 (results not shown). Both algorithms use the characteristic that only three different genotypes are observed for each SNP. Both algorithms can accommodate loci with more than three genotypes  but this may reduce or eliminate their benefit in terms of computing time over original residual updating schemes. The limitation on the number of genotypes per locus implies that imputed genotypes defined as gene contents cannot be used for individuals in the training data in the algorithm. Nevertheless  a simple transformation of gene contents to the most likely genotype overcomes this problem. This transformation could for instance be (on a 0-2 scale): genotypes<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5 are set to 0  genotypes<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.5 are set to 2  and all other genotypes are set to 1. Such transformations for imputed genotypes in the training data are expected to have a minor impact on the estimated SNP effects  provided that the genotypes are imputed with reasonable accuracy. Using gene contents for selection candidates  i.e. individuals whose genetic merit is predicted using SNP effects estimated from the training data  is not inhibited by the proposed algorithms  because their predicted genetic merit can simply be obtained outside the algorithm by multiplying their gene contents with allele substitution effects that are estimated in the algorithm. The literature shows that for selection candidates  predictions differ when gene contents or the most likely genotypes are used []. The residual updating algorithms were implemented using standard (e.g. dot_product) Fortran functions. Computer-specific optimized libraries are available [  ] that can considerably reduce the CPU time required for  e.g.  vector and matrix multiplications []. Using such libraries may have a larger impact on CPU time for the residual updating algorithms than for the RHS-updating algorithm  since the former involves many more multiplications. However  even when using such optimized libraries  the RHS-updating algorithm is still expected to be considerably more efficient  because it drastically reduces the total number of required operations. It should be noted that the RHS-updating scheme requires slightly more overhead in terms of computing time than the residual updating scheme  for instance to define the RHS-blocks and the group coding within those blocks. Once RHS-blocks and group coding are defined  they can be used in each iteration of the Gibbs chain. This may limit flexibility in the algorithm. For instance  one way to improve mixing of the Gibbs chains  may be to permute the order of evaluation of SNP effects between iterations. With the RHS-updating scheme  the order of evaluation of SNP effects within RHS-blocks must be the same throughout the Gibbs chain  such that group coding within RHS-blocks needs to be defined only once. Nevertheless  the order of evaluation of the RHS-blocks can still be permuted. Furthermore  to avoid that neighbouring SNPs are always evaluated in the same order  SNPs can be allocated to RHS-blocks at random. The RHS-updating scheme not only considerably reduced computing time  by up to 93%  but also resulted in a reduction of the amount of RAM used of up to 66%. Due to the nature of the RHS-updating algorithm  computing time and RAM use are linearly related with the number of SNPs considered  similar to the residual updating algorithm. This implies that the relative benefit of using the RHS-updating algorithm compared to the residual updating algorithm is not affected by the number of SNPs included. In our implementation  which is written in Fortran 95  group codes within RHS-blocks were stored as an integer(2) variable  while the genotypes in the original implementation with residual updating were stored as an integer(1) variable. It should be noted that storing group codes as integer(1) would lead to a further reduction in RAM requirements of almost 50%  because the array that stores the group codes uses close to 100% of the RAM used by the algorithm. Storing group codes as integer(1)  implies that the number of SNPs included per RHS-block should be equal to four or less  i.e. the maximum value an integer(1) variable can take is equal to 127  and including 4 (5) SNPs per RHS-block yields 3<U+2009>=<U+2009>81 (3<U+2009>=<U+2009>243) groups; the maximum value an integer(2) variable can take  is equal to 32 767. This means that a maximum of nine SNPs can be included per RHS-block  otherwise the group code must be stored as integer(4)  i.e. including 9 (10) SNPs per RHS-block yields 3<U+2009>=<U+2009>19 683 (3<U+2009>=<U+2009>59 049) groups. Our results show that with the largest number of individuals considered (100 000)  the optimal number of SNPs included per RHS-block was equal to six. This suggests that it is unlikely that a number of individuals in the data that justifies including more than nine SNPs per RHS-block  and therefore requires storing group codes as integer(4)  is reached in the near future. In our implementation of RHS-updating  each RHS-block containing  SNPs is assumed to contain all 3 possible groups  which is most likely not always the case. Moreover  clever grouping of SNPs within RHS-block can reduce the observed number of groups within each RHS-block. Such redundancy could be used to further reduce computing time  but would also likely result in a more complicated algorithm. Two algorithms are presented to estimate SNP effects that can be implemented in a range of different genomic prediction models  as an alternative to the original residual updating scheme. The first alternative algorithm uses residual updating  here termed improved residual updating  and takes advantage of the characteristic that the predictor variables in the model (i.e. SNP genotypes) have only three possible values. The second alternative algorithm  here termed “RHS-updating”  extends the idea of improved residual updating across multiple SNPs. The improved residual updating algorithm achieved a reduction in computing time of 35.3 to 43.3%  but did not change the amount of RAM used  compared to the original residual updating scheme. The RHS-updating algorithm achieved a reduction in computing time of 74.5 to 93.0% and a reduction in RAM use of 13.1 to 66.4%  compared to the original residual updating scheme. Thus  the RHS-updating algorithm provides an interesting alternative to reduce both computing time and memory requirements. The maximum RAM requirement was measured by retrieving the process ID and then storing the RAM use for this particular process. On the Windows OS  this was done using the following Fortran code: PROGRAM GIBBS USE DFPORT !Module that contains function “GETPID” IMPLICIT NONE INTEGER :: PROC_ID CHARACTER(LEN<U+2009>=<U+2009>47) :: SYS_CALL … PROC_ID<U+2009>=<U+2009>GET_PID() !Retrieve process ID of the current process !Use DOS command “tasklist” to write RAM use to file “tasklist.txt” SYS_CALL<U+2009>=<U+2009>\"tasklist /fi \"\"PID eq \"\"<U+2009> ><U+2009>tasklist.txt\" WRITE(SYS_CALL(23:29) '(i7)')PROC_ID CALL SYSTEM(SYS_CALL) … END PROGRAM GIBBS de los Campos G  Hickey JM  Pong-Wong R  Daetwyler HD  Calus MPL: Whole-genome regression and prediction methods applied to plant and animal breeding.

The model provides breeding values for both purebred and crossbred performances. Genomic evaluation incorporates marker genotypes into a genetic evaluation system. Among popular methods are the so-called single-step methods  in which marker genotypes are incorporated into a traditional animal model by using a combined relationship matrix that extends the marker-based relationship matrix to non-genotyped animals. However  a single-step method for genomic evaluation of both purebred and crossbred performances has not been developed yet. An extension of the Wei and van der Werf model that incorporates genomic information is presented. The extension consists of four steps: (1) the Wei van der Werf model is reformulated using two partial relationship matrices for the two breeds; (2) marker-based partial relationship matrices are constructed; (3) marker-based partial relationship matrices are adjusted to be compatible to pedigree-based partial relationship matrices and (4) combined partial relationship matrices are constructed using information from both pedigree and marker genotypes. The extension of the Wei van der Werf model can be implemented using software that allows inverse covariance matrices in sparse format as input. A method for genomic evaluation of both purebred and crossbred performances was developed for a two-breed crossbreeding system. The method allows information from crossbred animals to be incorporated in a coherent manner for such crossbreeding systems. Production systems based on crossbreeding are predominant in pig and chicken breeding and take advantage of the increased performance of crossbred animals compared to purebred animals. For a two-breed crossbreeding system  Wei and van der Werf (Appendix 2 in []) presented a model for genetic evaluation using information from both purebred and crossbred animals. The model provides estimated breeding values for purebred (mating with own breed) and crossbred (mating with the other breed) performances that are different but correlated. The model is particularly attractive since it can fit a breeding goal that includes both purebred and crossbred performances (see Jiang and Groen []). This model is the starting point of our paper. Genomic selection [] has offered a new paradigm for livestock breeding and has been successfully applied for selection within purebred populations [–]. Moreover  genomic selection also offers greater opportunities for incorporating information from crossbreds and selecting for crossbred performance [–]. Genomic selection of purebreds for crossbred performance was proposed by Ibáne~z-Escriche et al. [] that used phenotypes on crossbreds only  and a genomic model with breed of origin specific allele substitution effects. The resulting breeding values for purebred animals were for crossbred performance. Although the study included genomic data  it was less sophisticated than the Wei and van der Werf model [] since each animal had only one breeding value and phenotype recordings in purebreds were not used. In addition  it assumed that all relevant animals were genotyped  which would not be a very likely scenario in practice. In cases in which not all animals are genotyped  the so-called single-step methods [–] provide a coherent approach for genomic evaluation. These methods incorporate marker genotypes into a traditional animal model [] by using a combined relationship matrix that extends the marker-based relationship matrix of VanRaden [] to non-genotyped animals  and they have been shown to perform well for genomic evaluation of dairy cattle [  ]  pigs [  ] and chickens []. Misztal et al. [] provided an extension with “unknown-parent groups” to allow for different populations  but using such an approach on data from both purebred and crossbred animals would assume equal genetic variances in the two breeds and in the crossbreds  and also that breeding values for purebred and crossbred performances are the same. A single-step method for genomic evaluation of both purebred and crossbred performances has not been developed yet. In a genomic model  when crossbred animals are genotyped  it is natural to split the additive genetic effect of crossbreds into breed of origin specific genetic components  as in Ibáne~z-Escriche et al. []. Each of these components is a partial genetic effect  in the sense that only breed-specific alleles are used. This use of the terminology “partial genetic effect” is consistent with the model of Garcia-Cortes and Toro []  in which for multibreed analysis the additive genetic value is split into several independent parts depending on their genetic origin  with the variance-covariance structure of each part being determined by a partial relationship matrix (constructed from pedigree). A partial relationship matrix is a relationship matrix that describes relationships only according to genetic origin. From this point of view  partial relationship matrices are key when constructing a single-step method for both purebred and crossbred performances. However  the Wei and van der Werf model is not formulated using partial relationship matrices  and it therefore needs to be reformulated for the purpose of incorporating genomic information. The aim of this paper is to present an extension of the Wei van der Werf model that incorporates genomic information. The extension consists of four steps: (1) the Wei van der Werf model is reformulated using two partial relationship matrices [] for the two breeds; (2) marker-based partial relationship matrices similar to VanRaden [] are constructed; (3) marker-based partial relationship matrices are adjusted to be compatible to pedigree-based partial relationship matrices  similar to Christensen et al. [] and (4) combined partial relationship matrices are constructed using information from both pedigree and marker genotypes  similar to the combined relationship matrix of Legarra et al.  Aguilar et al. and Christensen and Lund [–]. This extension of the Wei and van der Werf model can be implemented using software that allows inverse covariance matrices in sparse format as input. Here  the Wei van der Werf model (Appendix 2 in []) is presented. The two breeds are named  and   and it is assumed that all crossbred animals  have known purebred parents. The number of animals in the pedigree is  and  for breed  and breed   respectively  and the number of crossbred animals is . The model for the phenotypes is a trivariate model where the vectors    and  contain phenotypes on the breed   breed  and crossbred  animals  respectively  and for the three breed groups    and   the vectors    and  contain fixed effects  and    and  are the residual error vectors. The -dimensional vector  contains breeding values for purebred performance for breed  animals (mating within breed )  and matrix  is an incidence matrix assigning breeding values to records. Vector  and matrix  are defined similarly for breed . Finally  the -dimensional vector  contains the additive genetic effects for crossbred animals  and these are related to the vectors of breeding values for purebred animals for crossbred performance (mating with the other breed) as follows where the matrices  and  assign purebred parents to crossbred offspring   is an -dimensional vector containing breeding values for crossbred performance for breed  animals (mating with breed  animals)   is an -dimensional vector containing breeding values for crossbred performance for breed  animals (mating with breed  animals)  and the vector  contains the Mendelian sampling effects. The genetic covariances are described by and the three vectors are independent. The matrices  and  are the additive relationship matrices for breed  and breed   respectively   denotes the Kronecker product  and are the 2×2 variance-covariance matrices containing the genetic variances for purebred breeding values and crossbred breeding values  and the covariance between the two  for breed  and breed   respectively. The variance-covariance matrix of the Mendelian sampling term is a diagonal matrix  with elements where for crossbred animal   () denotes the breed  parent and () denotes the breed  parent. The Wei and van der Werf model is an additive genetic model in the sense that the breeding values for purebred performance      are additive genetic effects  and the breeding values for crossbred performance      in combination with the genetic effects  are also additive genetic effects. The model therefore does not contain dominance genetic effects explicitly. In practice  such an additive genetic model may also partly capture dominant gene actions and other non-additive gene actions []. The fact that genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred performances are different from one would be due to the presence of dominant gene actions in combination with different allele frequencies in the two breeds []  in addition to genetic effects being different in different environments. In addition  the model captures the general level of heterosis in crossbred animals since it has a seperate fixed mean effect for crossbred animals. Wei and van der Werf [] made an alternative formulation of the model. The term  is not of interest for genetic evaluation when crossbred animals are not used for breeding  and Wei and van der Werf reformulated the model using  as the residual error term for the crossbred phenotypes and thereby expressed the model as a reduced model using only the terms      and  with breeding values for purebred animals. Note that due to different levels of inbreeding of parents (see formula (3))  the term  has heterogeneous variance  and assuming a constant variance is an approximation. The reduced model can be implemented using software that handle multi-trait genetic models. For the purpose of this paper  observed marker genotypes on crossbred animals provide information on the Mendelian sampling term   and the absorption of this term into the residual error term is therefore not well-suited. For this reason we do not follow the reduced model in this paper. Finally  the special case where  can be formulated as where  denotes artificial random vectors such that the genetic variance-covariance matrix can be expressed using a Kronecker product  and  is the usual additive relationship matrix for all animals. This can therefore be implemented using a combined pedigree across all animals. We will return to this special case in the Discussion section. Here  the Wei and van der Werf [] model is reformulated using breed-specific partial relationship matrices  as in Garcia-Cortes and Toro []. Partial relationship matrices describe relationships according to genetic origin. The starting point of the reformulation is the Mendelian sampling term for the crossbred animals in formula (2). This term can be split into breed of origin effects    where  and  are independent. Formula (3) can be formulated in matrix notation as   where  and   with  being an identity matrix of size   and  and  denoting diagonal matrices containing diagonal elements in matrices  and   respectively. In other words  we decompose the Mendelian sampling term into Mendelian sampling terms for the  and  gametes. The additive genetic effect for crossbred animals in formula (2) can then be expressed as where     and  and  are independent  i.e. the genetic effects for crossbred animals is split into two breed of origin genetic effects. Thus  the model equation system (1) can be written as: Focusing on breed   the variance-covariance matrix of the genetic effects  becomes where  is a matrix with elements  and  when <U+2260>  and the covariance matrix between  and  becomes Therefore  the variance-covariance matrix of breed  specific genetic effects for crossbred performance equals where the symmetric ()-dimensional matrix is the breed  specific partial relationship matrix in Garcia-Cortes and Toro [] (see below). Similarly  the variance-covariance matrix of breed  specific genetic effects for crossbred performance equals where is the breed  specific partial relationship matrix (see below). Garcia-Cortes and Toro [] presented a partition of the variance-covariance matrix of additive genetic values into breed-specific and breed-segregation terms  where each term is a scaled partial relationship matrix. The partial relationship matrices are constructed using recursive formulas similar to usual recursive formulas for the additive relationship matrix []. For the two-breed terminal crossbreeding system  the partition results in breed  and breed  specific partial relationship matrices  but no breed-segregation partial relationship matrices; we refer to Garcia-Cortes and Toro [] for the general case. The recursive formulas for the breed  specific partial relationships are: where () and () are the two parents of animal   animal  is not a descendant of   and  is the breed  proportion of individual  (equal to 1 for purebred  animals  0 for purebred  animals and 0.5 for crossbred animals). To insure that partial relationship matrices are invertible  Munilla-Leguizamón and Cantet [] suggested to redefine the partial relationship matrices such that only elements that are non-null by breed origin were included  i.e. for the breed  specific partial relationships shown here  the elements related to purebred  animals are excluded. In this paper  we followed that suggestion  and it is not difficult to check that the matrix in (5) is indeed the breed  specific partial relationship matrix. Using matrix formulation  the breed  specific partial relationship matrix is  where  is a diagonal matrix with elements  when animal  is breed   and  when animal  is crossbred with breed  parent (). For matrix   the inverse matrix  is a lower triangular matrix with diagonal elements equal to 1 and in the lower diagonal  the only non-zero elements are -0.5 for offspring parent elements. An example with a small pedigree is in Table   and the corresponding partial relationship matrices are in Tables  and . The reformulation of the Wei and van der Werf model is completed by introducing two artificial random vectors  and  such that genetic variance-covariance matrices can be presented using Kronecker products. For breed   the genetic covariances are described by and similary for breed   the genetic covariances are described by Implementing the model requires inverses of the two partial relationship matrices. The inverse of a partial relationship matrix  can be expressed by the usual formula and the usual methods for computing the diagonal elements of the partial relationship matrix and the inverse partial relationship matrix in sparse format [  ] can be applied. The model is a trivariate model with breed  and  specific genetic effects for both purebred and crossbred performances  and can be implemented using a software package for multivariate mixed models that either explicitly can construct inverses of partial relationship matrices from pedigree or alternatively can use inverse covariance matrices in sparse format as input (e.g.  DMU []  WOMBAT []  ASReml []  blupf90 [])  MiX99 []. Extending the model to incorporate genomic information requires the construction of two combined breed-specific partial relationship matrices expressed as inverse matrices  and for this purpose  marker-based breed-specific partial relationship matrices need to be constructed  and marker-based and pedigree-based partial relationship matrices need to be made compatible. These are the topics of the following subsections. Here  a marker-based breed  specific partial relationship matrix is constructed. The assumption here is that the marker genotypes for crossbred animals are phased such that it is known which allele originated from breed  and which allele originated from breed . The marker genotype matrix  for purebred  animals has elements 1  0 or 1 if SNP  of individual  is 11  12  or 22  respectively. For crossbred animals  the breed  marker allele matrix  has elements  = -0.5 or 0.5 if loci  of individual  has breed  allele 1 or 2  respectively. Constructing a marked-based breed-specific partial relationship matrix similar to the marker-based relationship matrix of VanRaden [] is done by using the breed-specific alleles only. The marker-based breed  specific partial relationship matrix  is divided into submatrices with indices denoting genotyped breed  and crossbred animals  which are is defined as where the vector  contains estimated breed  specific allele frequencies based on marker genotypes for purebred animals and breed  specific marker alleles for crossbred animals  and  is a scaling parameter. The scaling parameter  is unspecified here since we adjust the marker-based partial relationship matrix to make it compatible with the pedigree-based partial relationship matrices  similar to Christensen et al. [] (see below). The marker-based breed  specific partial relationship matrix  is constructed similarly. Matrices  and  correspond to two different covariance structures  while matrix  does not exist. For crossbred animals that are genotyped  the genetic effect is the sum of two effects  with variance-covariance matrices proportional to  and   respectively. Since a genetic effect with a marker-based relationship matrix can be equivalently formulated as a sum of allele substitution effects  the genetic effect for crossbred animal  therefore equals where  are independent breed of origin specific substitution effects for SNP =1…  . The model for crossbred animals is therefore as described by Ibáne~z-Escriche et al. []. Marker-based and pedigree-based partial relationship matrices must be compatible [    ]. In order to achieve this  either the marker-based partial relationship matrix or the pedigree-based partial relationship matrix must be adjusted []. Here  we show how to adjust the breed  specific marker-based partial relationship matrix    to the breed  specific pedigree-based partial relationship matrix for the subset of genotyped animals    similar to Christensen et al []. The adjustment is of the form with submatrices corresponding to purebred genotyped and crossbred genotyped animals   denoting a vector of ones (with sub-index denoting the dimension:  is equal to the number of genotyped purebred animals and  to the number of genotyped crossbred animals); matrix  being implicitly defined; and  and  are parameters that need to be estimated. The form of the adjustment above is explained in Appendix Appendix A. According to Christensen et al. []  the parameters  and  can be determined by solving a system of two equations where    and  denote averages of all elements of the matrices    and   and   respectively  and    and  denote averages of diagonal elements of the three matrices  respectively. Based on  and   the resulting parameter estimates become Note that parameter  is completely confounded with the scaling parameter  in (5)  and the choice of the scaling parameter is therefore irrelevant. The combined partial relationship matrix  can be constructed similar to the combined relationship matrix for purebred animals [–]. On the inverse scale  the elements of the matrix for non-genotyped animals do not depend on the marker genotypes. Therefore  with . Parameter  is the fraction of genetic variance not captured by the marker genotypes  and in practice should be chosen to maximize accuracy and minimize bias of the resulting estimated breeding values []. Computation of the submatrix  follows the Colleau algorithm [  ]  which is based on the decomposition  shown in a previous subsection. The essential idea is to compute the  th column of  by computing   where  is a vector with element  equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0  based on Misztal et al. []. The algorithm consists of computing consecutively = by solving the sparse system ()= for   =   and finally  by solving the sparse system  for . In summary  computations for creating  are straightforward. First  matrices    and  are computed  then  is adjusted   is computed  and finally matrices  and  are inverted. The sparse inverse matrices  and  are used as input when implementing the extension of the Wei and van der Werf model. This paper demonstrates how to incorporate marker genotypes into the Wei and van der Werf model for genetic evaluation using both purebred and crossbred information. The approach builds on using partial relationship matrices  and assumes that the marker genotypes of crossbreds can be phased such that the breed of origin of alleles is known. Many different algorithms for phasing have been developed [  ]  and it has been shown that the accuracy of phasing depends among others on size of the sample and relatedness of animals within the sample. An alternative to using combined partial relationship matrices would be to specify one combined relationship matrix across all animals in the three breed groups    and . As mentioned in the Methods section  this is actually a special case of the model where . With this approach  only one marker-based relationship matrix would have to be created and there would be no need to know the breed of origin of alleles. However  the adjustment of the marker-based relationship matrix to be compatible to the pedigree-based relationship matrix becomes more complicated when both breeds are considered at the same time and  as mentioned  this model is less sophisticated than the model developed in this paper. More complicated crossbreeding systems with three breeds (mating crossbred  animals with purebred  animals) or four breeds (mating breeds  and   mating breeds  and   and finally mating the two groups of crossbred animals  with ) are typically used in pig and chicken production. The three-breed crossbreeding system was studied using pig data by Ibanez et al. []  using the Garcia-Cortes and Toro [] decomposition of the relationship matrix  and assuming breeding values for purebred and crossbred performances were identical. However  an extension of the Wei and van der Werf model to the three-breed crossbreeding system can be formulated as follows (only the vector containing genetic effects for terminal crossbreds is shown)  where the genetic terms    and  are related to the vectors containing breeding values for  crossbred performance for purebred animals     and   respectively  by partial relationships. The genetic term  is a breed-segregation term that is independent of the other genetic terms  and has variance-covariance matrix   where  is a parameter. Thus  the genetic parameter  and the error variance parameter  are not both identifiable   can be incorporated into the residual error  and the three breed crossbreeding model can be formulated using three breed-specific partial relationship matrices. Extending the three-breed crossbreeding model to include observed marker genotypes is currently been investigated. The model presented in this paper is an additive genetic model (in the sense that it considers and estimates substitution effects)  but in practice it may capture both additive gene actions and partly dominant gene actions. Using purebred pig data  Su et al. [] showed that when an additive genomic model was extended to explicitly incorporate dominance genomic effects  improved accuracies of predictions of both total genetic values and breeding values were obtained. Using simulated data from crossbred animals  Zeng et al. [] showed that an increased response to selection was obtained with a genomic model with dominance genetic effects compared to an additive genomic model. Lo et al. [] extended the Wei and van der Werf model to include dominance genetic effects and this model has been used in several studies on real data [  ]. The formulation of that extension is based on extending the reduced model of Wei and van der Werf (see the Methods section) by incorporating a dominance genetic effect for the purebred phenotypes and a full-sib family effect for the crossbred phenotypes. Similar to the reduced model  this model formulation does not directly contain individual genetic effects for crossbred animals and is  therefore  not well-suited for incorporating genomic information on crossbred animals. A marker-based dominance relationship matrix was proposed by Su et al. []  but this would need to be extended to a combined dominance relationship matrix  and further extended to a crossbreeding system. Extending the model in this paper to contain dominance genetic effects would be an interesting topic for future research. A method for genomic evaluation of both purebred and crossbred performances was developed for a two-breed crossbreeding system. The method allows information from crossbred animals to be incorporated in a coherent manner for such crossbreeding systems. In this appendix  we present the explanation behind the adjustment of the marker-based partial relationship matrix. Marker-based relationships  with allele frequencies equal to the observed ones  reflect relationships relative to the genotyped animals  whereas pedigree-based relationships are relative to the base population of the pedigree. The idea behind the adjustment of the marker-based partial relationship matrix is to translate relationships to become relative to the base population of the pedigree  instead of being relative to the given set of animals  as suggested by Powell et al. []  and which is also the idea behind the adjustment in Christensen et al. []. For a given set of animals (purebred and crossbred) and a given breed  let us assume that breed-specific gametes are randomly assigned to animals (purebred animals receive two gametes each  and crossbred animals receive one gamete each)  and let  be equal to twice the gametic relationship coefficient. The partial relationship matrix for these animals    has entries and can therefore be written as with submatrices corresponding to purebred and crossbred animals   being a vector of ones and  the identity matrix (with sub-indices denoting the dimension:  equal to number of purebred animals and  number of crossbred animals). The matrix would be a partial relationship matrix when gametes are unrelated (=0)  and therefore the partial relationship matrix relative to the given set of animals. Hence  the formula (7) shows how relationships relative to the given set of animals are related to relationships relative to the base population of the pedigree. Therefore  it provides a formula to translate a marker-based relationship matrix (with allele frequencies being the observed ones) to have the same base population as the pedigree-based relationship matrix. As in Christensen et al. []  we substitute  for 1-/2 to incorporate the scaling parameter  in (5).

We conclude that the availability of the HD chip can be used to detect association signals that remained hidden when using lower density genotyping platforms  since LD dropped below 0.2 at distances of 50 kb. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between molecular markers reflects the correlation between genotypes of two markers or the degree of non-random association between their alleles. Previous studies that used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to describe patterns of LD in cattle at the whole-genome level[–] have suggested that 30 000 to 300 000 SNPs are necessary to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS)  depending on the trait studied and the statistical power desired[  ]. Today  the availability of high-density SNP platforms that can assay more than 0.5 million loci offers the required marker density. The extent of LD has implications for both GWAS and the delivery of accurate genomic predictions. However  its importance is often neglected despite the fact that it is known that it can introduce bias. Collecting and using SNP genotyping data have exploded for cattle in the last few years due in part to decreasing genotyping cost and to efforts to improve cattle breeding through genomic selection. Despite this  few studies have documented the behaviour of LD using the expanded set of 777 000 SNPs available on the BovineHD platform (Illumina Inc  San Diego). One of the significant advances of this denser chip is that it allows for an accurate estimation of LD over short physical distances as it contains many more marker pairs separated by 10 kb or less. Here  we present the LD decay curves for SNPs on bovine autosomes and the X chromosome for three genetic groups of cattle breeds:  (taurine)   (indicine) and a composite beef cattle group. The results were compared to an independent population to confirm and potentially generalize the findings. This report is intended to be used as an updated description of the extent of LD in beef cattle. All analyses were performed using genotypes generated in previous work. Therefore  for this study  no animal ethics approval was requested because no new animals were sampled. Animals used in this study (Table ) were part of a large experimental Australian population[] that includes the three main cattle types:  breeds (Angus  Hereford  Limousin and Shorthorn)   (Brahman) and composite cattle (Tropical Composite  Santa Gertrudis and Belmont Red). To confirm our findings  genotyping data from each cattle type (Angus  Brahman and Santa Gertrudis) were sourced from the Bovine HapMap consortium[]. All animals were genotyped using the BovineHD SNP chip (Illumina  San Diego; ) that includes 777 962 markers. Quality control and imputation of missing data in the Australian sample followed the pipeline described by Bolormaa et al.[]. Briefly  stringent filters were applied to each SNP (call rate  duplicated map position  extreme departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)  resulting in 729 068 informative SNPs. Missing genotypes were imputed within each breed type using 30 iterations of the BEAGLE software[]. Genotypes for the same set of SNPs were extracted from the Bovine HapMap dataset[] but missing genotypes were not imputed. LD between each pair of SNPs  measured as r  which is less susceptible to bias due to differences in allelic frequency[]  and within-breed genetic diversity (heterozygosity and proportion of polymorphic SNPs) were calculated using PLINK v1.07[]. For the X chromosome  two scenarios were explored: one including all markers  and the second including only fairly polymorphic markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.1 in all breeds. A high proportion of polymorphic markers was observed across all breeds  with the taurine breeds showing a slightly lower proportion (<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.86) than their indicine and composite counterparts (<U+2009>~<U+2009>1.00 for both) (Table ). Heterozygozity () ranged from 0.25 (Brahman from the HapMap dataset and Shorthorn) to 0.35 (Tropical Composite). In general  the composite breeds showed higher  (0.34) than the taurine (0.28) and indicine breeds (0.26) because they originated from a mixture of both these types of cattle. The pattern of LD differed between breeds and the resulting decay curves could be grouped according to breed type (Figure  and Additional file: Figure S1). At short marker distances  indicine breeds had lower LD for autosomes compared to either the composite (intermediate) or taurine (highest) breeds. This is in agreement with previous studies[  ]  but the degree of variation fluctuates. When the distance between markers was 10 kb  the average observed LD (r) for Brahman and Angus was 0.25 and 0.46  respectively (Table )  which is equivalent to the LD reported for a comparable indicine cattle breed i.e. Nelore (0.27)[]  but higher than the value previously reported for Angus (0.35)[]. This difference is not as clear for markers separated by a larger physical distance (> 70 kb) where LD quickly approached background levels  and r was<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.10 in both studies and also in dairy breeds[]. The average LD between unlinked markers (SNPs on different chromosomes) was at the background level or less across all breeds (see Additional file: Table S1) and was negatively correlated with sample size (Pearson correlation  r<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.75). Indicine cattle continued to have a lower LD than most of the other breeds when the distances between markers were large  which suggests that they originated from a larger ancestral population.  Additional file: Figure S1 discriminates each breed. Analysis of LD across the bovine X chromosome (BTAX) revealed a different pattern to that observed for autosomes (Figure ). The LD decay curves were still grouped by cattle type  however with a different ranking compared to what was observed for LD on autosomes. Over very short distances between markers on BTAX (< 5 kb)  the indicine breeds still had the lowest average LD (r<U+2009>~<U+2009>0.5) and the taurine breeds had the highest (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.6). However  contrary to the pattern observed for autosomes  LD across BTAX decayed fastest in the taurine breeds  such that for marker pairs separated by 50 kb  the average LD was lower than that in either of the composite indicine populations (Figure A). The same LD patterns were observed when males only were evaluated (see Additional file: Figure S2). However  when only SNPs that were polymorphic for all breeds (MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.1) were used  the LD decay for BTAX became much more homogeneous across all breeds and  in fact  did not differ much from the results obtained for autosomes (Figure B). Because of the bottlenecks that cattle populations have experienced since their domestication and more recently during breed formation and because of the frequent intensive use of artificial insemination  it would be reasonable to expect extensive LD on BTAX. This expectation agrees with the LD decay observed for indicine and composite breeds when using all SNPs but not with the LD decay observed for all taurine breeds  nor for the LD decay observed for all breeds when only polymorphic SNPs were used. We speculate that the use of all markers inflated the LD observed for indicine and composite breeds (or biased the LD for taurine breeds downwards). However  the use of only polymorphic SNPs was too stringent and did not allow the analyses to capture the expected difference in LD on BTAX due to its unique inheritance.  MAF<U+2009>=<U+2009>minor allele frequency. To assess whether the results obtained here were a specific feature of the Australian population  we repeated the analyses with an independent sample of Angus  Santa Gertrudis and Brahman animals from the Bovine HapMap dataset[  ]. Results for all analyses on these populations showed high concordance with LD observed in the Australian populations for both the autosomes and BTAX (Figures  and). Our results expand on previous studies of genome-wide LD in bovine populations. By using larger samples and a much higher density of markers than before and by exploring variation across autosomes and the X chromosome  we obtained an exponential increase in pair-wise LD comparisons  which allowed us to produce robust results. Because LD dropped below 0.2 at marker distances above 50 kb  we conclude that the availability of the HD chip enables detection of association signals that remained hidden when using lower density genotyping platforms.

These regions can be detected because of their lower genetic variability and specific regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns.MethodsBy comparing the differences in regional LD variation between dairy and beef cattle types  and between indicine and taurine subspecies  we aim at finding signatures of selection for production and adaptation in cattle breeds.

These regions can be detected because of their lower genetic variability and specific regional linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. By comparing the differences in regional LD variation between dairy and beef cattle types  and between indicine and taurine subspecies  we aim at finding signatures of selection for production and adaptation in cattle breeds. The VarLD method was applied to compare the LD variation in the autosomal genome between breeds  including Angus and Brown Swiss  representing taurine breeds  and Nelore and Gir  representing indicine breeds. Genomic regions containing the top 0.01 and 0.1 percentile of signals were characterized using the UMD3.1  genome assembly to identify genes in those regions and compared with previously reported selection signatures and regions with copy number variation. For all comparisons  the top 0.01 and 0.1 percentile included 26 and 165 signals and 17 and 125 genes  respectively  including      and . The VarLD method is a powerful tool to identify differences in linkage disequilibrium between cattle populations and putative signatures of selection with potential adaptive and productive importance. When a part of the genome that confers enhanced fitness or productive ability is preferentially kept in a population by increasing the frequency of favorable alleles  neutral loci that surround this region and that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with it  are also retained  thus driving the frequency of particular haplotypes in the region towards fixation in a pattern that decays progressively with distance from the causative location [–]. Such a selective sweep can be detected by reduced haplotype diversity and a different LD pattern when compared to those of the surrounding background [  ]. Characterizing regions that are affected by selection may enable inferences on the functionality of a genomic region and possibly the effects of specific genes or gene combinations on specific traits [–]. Indicine (i.e.  ) cattle have been bred for adaptation to tropical and marginal production environments [  ]  while taurine (i.e.  ) cattle have been intensively selected for production in temperate regions of the world [    ]. Analyzing differences between these two sub-species of cattle and comparing breeds selected for different purposes (milk or beef) within these subspecies may yield insights into genomic regions that are impacted by these differences in adaptation and productivity traits associated with these two groups of cattle []. The amount of LD that exists in genomic regions within a population is a key parameter to trace selective sweeps [  ] and differences in decay of LD between bovine populations have been reported [–]. Analyses based on the study of regional variation of LD within a population compared to their background LD level  and the contrast of the regions with the same analyses in other populations  allow the assessment of signals of differential selection  also called signatures of selection (SS)  in different cattle breeds. In addition  a high coincidence between SS and copy number variants (CNV) has been reported for the human Hapmap populations []  which suggests that selection mechanisms may possibly act through copy number differences []. Indeed  a study of the effects of CNV on gene expression in Drosophila identified several potential outcomes of gene copy number variation  including the possibility that gene expression increases  decreases or remains stable as copy number fluctuates []. Thus  it is of interest to compare SS obtained via analysis of LD variation with reported CNV for the bovine genome [  ]. A total of 108 Nelore (NEL)  29 Gir (GIR)  33 Angus (ANG)  and 85 Brown Swiss (BSW) individuals were genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (HD chip) []. The samples used were either derived from previous studies  approved by local ethical committees  or obtained from AI centers through their routine practice so no further ethical approval was required for the present analysis. Only autosomal SNPs were included in the analysis  resulting in approximately 735 000 SNPs. Quality control measures were calculated using the PLINK software [  ] separately for each breed; parameters and thresholds used were a SNP minor allele frequency of at least 5%  a genotype call rate of at least 90%  both per SNP and per animal  and a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium z-test with p<U+2009>><U+2009>10. In addition  the population was pruned for close relationships using the identity-by-state (IBS) relationship matrix  or in other words the pairwise genomic kinship coefficient as proposed by Leutenegger et al. []  estimated with the GenABEL R package  function [] and removing one of the individuals from a pair with an IBS<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8 (this limit was defined experimentally by assessing IBS relationships of 20 half-sibs). Final SNP counts and numbers of individuals used in the analyses are in Table . A total of six pair-wise comparisons between the four breeds were conducted. These comparisons included differences between the indicine and taurine (I/T) subspecies  differences between dairy and beef (D/B) breed types  and both subspecies and breed type differences (I/T  D/B). Specifically  the six comparisons were NEL/ANG (I/T)  GIR/BSW (I/T)  GIR/NEL (D/B)  BSW/ANG (D/B)  GIR/ANG (I/T  D/B)  and BSW/NEL (I/T  D/B). Since the method applied here requires using common SNPs  i.e. SNPs that segregate in both breeds compared  for each comparison the coincident SNPs after quality control were extracted. The number of SNPs used in each analysis is in Table . To have an overview of the population structure pertaining to the individuals and breeds included in the study  a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out using the IBS matrix generated with GenABEL []  by converting the calculated genomic kinship coefficients to squared Euclidean distances that capture the differences between individuals via classical multidimensional scaling [] in  dimensional spaces (where n represents the number of samples) of  eigenvectors  by applying the  function from the R ‘stats’ package v.3.0.1 []. To provide an insight about the overall levels of LD in the different breeds  genome-wide pairwise r values of SNPs separated by a maximum distance of 100 kilobases (kb) (average SNP distance was 7.9 kb)  were calculated and graphed using R [] and PLINK [  ] software. VarLD is a program for quantifying differences in genome-wide LD patterns between populations []. The software quantifies for each window of 50 SNPs the signed r of all pairwise comparisons and a square matrix is built with the results  representing a correlation matrix between all SNPs []. Equality between the elements of the two matrices is estimated by comparing the extent of departure between their respective ranked eigenvalues after eigen-decomposition of each matrix []. A raw VarLD score is assigned for the window as the trace of the difference between the respective diagonal matrices with the sorted eigenvalues in descending order []. The magnitude of this score gives a measure of the degree of dissimilarity between the correlation matrices and is used to quantify the extent of regional LD differences between the populations [  ]. Positive selection for genes in a genomic region from a specific population is likely to produce a different LD pattern in that region when compared to a non-selected population  which leads to the identification of the region [      ]. The methodology used to calculate VarLD scores is described in more detail in [    ]. In short  permutation is used to obtain a Monte Carlo statistical significance and the scores are standardized () to center the distribution of the scores around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one  helping to avoid bias in the raw VarLD scores due to differences in the size of the windows in terms of base-pairs (bp) and the populations being compared having different background LD levels. The software uses sliding windows and we applied windows containing 50 SNPs and a step-size of one SNP  following Teo et al. []. A window was flagged as a putative SS (SS region) if the associated score  was greater than or equal to the score at the 99.99 percentile and 99.9 percentile of all scores across the genome. The middle position of the first window in an identified SS was taken as the starting point of a signal  and the end position was the middle of the final window in the SS. To assess which breed showed a selective sweep in a particular region with extreme   we graphed LD heatmaps of the r between all SNPs from the identified SS region  using PLINK [  ] and R []. Since the levels of r differed greatly between the two breeds on each comparison group it was relatively easy to determine the origin of a sweep by assigning it to the breed with the higher LD levels in the region. To have an additional evaluation of the LD differences between the breeds included in the identified SS regions  we estimated the average r of SNPs in windows of 200 kb  with a step-size of 20 kb  discarding any windows that included less than 50 SNPs  and then graphed the results using R []. Only the graphs corresponding to the regions explored in detail in this publication are presented  together with graphical representation of the VarLD scores in these candidate SS regions. After the SS candidate regions were defined  we extracted details on these regions  including comparison group  chromosome  and bp position (middle position of the starting and ending windows included in the peak). Then  the SS regions were sorted by chromosome and bp position  and common signals across comparison groups were highlighted. To identify genes possibly associated with the SS regions  we compared the bp position of the regions to the position of the genes listed from the Ensembl Biomart Tool [] for the UMD3.1  genome assembly [  ]  and extracted a list of genes having a common position with the SS regions. Regions that were flagged by the above method were compared to the latest CNV reports by Bickhart et al. [] and Hou et al. [] on the bovine genome to detect common regions between VarLD SS and variations in copy number. The resulting signals were also compared to previously published SS using different methodologies and SNP densities. Information from the supplementary files of these publications was used for the comparisons. The PCA results (Figure ) show that the first Principal Component (PC) explaining 10.2% of the SNP variation clearly separates the taurine and indicine populations  while the second PC explaining 3.7% of the variance divides each subspecies separating the breeds correctly. The patterns of dispersion also indicate that the two indicine breeds are genetically closer to each other and have lower within breed variance as compared to the taurine breeds. The results of LD decay up to a distance of 100 kb for the four breeds are in Figure . The pattern of decay shows higher LD at short distances for the taurine than the indicine breeds  particularly for Angus  reaching an average r of 0.3 at a distance of almost 40 kb  while both indicine breeds showed a faster decay  reaching an average r of 0.3 at approximately 20 kb. <U+2009>Principal Component Analysis derived from the identity-by-state genomic relationship matrix between all individuals from the four studied breeds  showing the first two principal components (PC) and the variance explained by each component in parenthesis on the corresponding axis. <U+2009>Average LD decay (r) from 0 to 100 kb for each of the four breeds included in the analysis. The genome-wide distribution of standardized VarLD scores for the six comparison sets is in Figure . Strong SS were confined to narrow regions of the genome. The most distinct peaks were observed for the ANG/BSW and the GIR/NEL comparisons  which show that the largest VarLD scores are found when comparing different production types within a subspecies. This result is confirmed by the differences in the percentile distributions between the six comparison sets (Table )  which shows higher 0.1 and 0.01 percentile scores for these two comparisons (ANG/BSW and GIR/NEL). <U+2009>Genome-wide plot of VarLD scores for all comparisons using the 99.99 and 99.9 percentiles of the standardized scores across the genome as thresholds. For the top 0.01 percentile scores across all comparisons  26 signals were found. Six SS were identified in more than one comparison and 17 genes were associated with these signals. For the top 0.1 percentile scores  165 signals were detected  covering 10.76 Mb and representing 0.43% of the autosomal genome. Combining the SS shared across several comparison analyses  a total of 42 regions were identified with 125 genes related to these genomic positions (see Additional file ). For the I/T comparisons  detailed results for a signal that was found on BTA6 at 81.5-81.7 Mb and was shared across the NEL/ANG  NEL/BSW  GIR/ANG and GIR/BSW analyses are shown in Figure . This signal lies within the annotated boundaries of the  () gene (ENSBTAG00000024826) []. For this region  the two taurine breeds showed sustained high levels of LD  indicating a selective sweep in both these breeds. In addition  a loss of CNV  a type of variation caused by loss of genetic material due to deletions  was observed in this region  between 81.46 and 81.58 Mb  encompassing 71 SNPs and 120 kb. <U+2009>VarLD graph  LD heatmaps  and LD variation graphical results for the region showing a signal in all indicine/taurus comparisons on BTA6  between 81.5 and 81.7 Mb  inside the annotated boundaries of the <U+2009>(ENSBTAG00000024826) gene; the VarLD scores and LD variation analysis graphs represent the region between 81.4 to 81.8 Mb; the individual comparison heatmaps represent only the identified selection signature region  and on each heatmap the indicine breed is represented on the upper diagonal and the taurine breed on the lower diagonal. The NEL/ANG and GIR/ANG comparisons identified a SS on BTA3 between 14.9 and 15.5 Mb  with a peak between 15.37 and 15.39 Mb (Figure ). When assessing the LD behavior of the three breeds involved in these comparisons  we found that the signal corresponded to a region with extended high LD in the ANG breed near the  or  (ENSBTAG00000003948) [] gene. <U+2009>VarLD graph  LD heatmaps  and LD variation graphical results for the region showing a signal in the Gir/Angus and Nelore/Angus comparison groups on BTA 3 between 15.34 and 15.39 Mb  overlapping with the annotated boundaries of the <U+2009>gene (ENSBTAG00000003948); the VarLD scores and LD variation analysis graphs represent the region between 15.2 and 15.5 Mb; the individual comparison heatmaps represent only the identified selection signature region  with the Angus breed shown on the lower diagonal. For the D/B comparisons  the strongest signals were observed within subspecies  and primarily from taurine breed comparisons. For the taurine D/B comparison  one of the signals with the highest VarLD score was located on BTA24  between 37.79 and 37.84 Mb. This region (Figure ) includes the annotated boundaries of the  () and the  () genes []  and a high LD level between the SNPs in this region indicates that the SS is associated with the ANG breed. For the indicine D/B comparison  a signal on BTA5 between 48.5 and 49.1 Mb overlapped with the  ([] gene (see Figure )  and further analysis assigned this sweep to the Gir breed. <U+2009>VarLD graph  LD heatmaps  and LD variation graphical results for the region showing a signal in the Brown Swiss/Angus comparison group on BTA24  between 37.79 and 37.84 Mb  inside the annotated boundaries of the <U+2009>(ENSBTAG00000016024) and the <U+2009>(ENSBTAG00000026266) genes; the VarLD scores and LD variation analysis graphs represent the region between 37.6 and 38 Mb; the individual comparison heatmap represents only the identified selection signature region  with the Angus breed on the lower diagonal. <U+2009>VarLD graph  LD heatmaps  and LD variation graphical results for the region showing a signal in the Gir/Nelore comparison group on BTA5  between 48.5 and 49.1 Mb  inside the annotated boundaries of the  (ENSBTAG00000039435) gene; the VarLD scores and LD variation analysis graphs represent the region between 48.5 and 49 Mb; the individual comparison heatmap  represents only the identified selection signature region  with the Gir breed on the upper diagonal. Thirty-four signature signals from the top 0.1 percentile were found in regions that contained reported bovine CNV [  ]  and genes located in these regions are presented in Table . These 34 regions cover 1.84 Mb or 0.07% of the autosomal genome  and many of the CNV positions coincided between the two reports [] and [] even though the authors have used different type of data as source of information for CNV discovery  sequence and SNPs  respectively. Information about several other candidate genes identified in this study through the VarLD methodology and that were previously identified in other cattle SS studies are presented in Additional file . The VarLD method has the potential to capture recent strong selection because LD breaks down quickly over longer distances and  thus  high LD over an extended region is likely the result of recent selection. The human populations that have been analyzed [    ] have very similar extents and patterns of LD and differ from each other only in limited regions. Cattle populations differ from human populations because they have experienced very strong recent selection caused by breed formation and use of advanced reproductive technologies. This makes the comparison of LD between cattle breeds worthwhile []. Differences such as those observed here between indicine and taurine breeds in the rate of decay of LD with increasing distance have been previously reported but with lower marker densities [      ]. Our analysis clearly shows that the pattern of LD decay is faster in the indicine breeds compared to the taurine breeds. This supports the use of higher SNP densities in the indicine breeds  both for LD analysis and differences in LD patterns  in order to capture the nature of genomic events that affect narrow regions by having SNPs sufficiently close to the cause of an event to show significant LD. In this study  the regions with the highest VarLD scores that we identified were very narrow  with the largest signal covering 696.78 kb and the smallest signal involving single SNPs  which confirms the benefit of using a high-density SNP beadchip for this approach. The effect of ascertainment bias in the choice of SNPs for different SNP chip platforms has been discussed in the literature []  but the HD chip was constructed using a larger number of indicine breeds and individuals in the reference population  and in general seems to perform better on  individuals  than the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip []. When the analysis was replicated using the 50Kchip SNPs  nine signals were found for the 0.1 percentile  covering 24.9 Mb of the autosomal genome  and ranging in size from 212.3 kb to 10.2 Mb (results not shown)  with only four regions found in common with the analyses performed using the HD chip. This demonstrates a capacity for higher resolution analyses when using the HD chip. In the I/T comparisons  the strongest signal identified in all breed contrasts was created by unusually high LD in the taurine breeds. The [] gene encodes an enzyme that has an oxidoreductase activity on the CH-CH group of donors and other acceptors  and is directly involved in chemical reactions and pathways involving lipids []. The SS region containing  also overlaps with a region in which a particular type of CNV with loss of nucleotides is commonly observed  which suggests a possible role of copy number differences being causative in selection processes. Because the selection signature was found in the taurine breeds and is directly related to lipid production in the body  this is a suggestive signature of artificial selection for production purposes. The [] gene  detected in a signal between ANG and both indicine breeds  is a gene involved in cholesterol (sterols) and steroid biosynthesis []. Lipid synthesis is a very important physiological function for both milk [] and beef [  ] production  and both taurine breeds have been selected intensively for these characteristics during the past decades [    ]. The  gene []  detected as a selective sweep in the Gir breed  is a specific repressor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor  activin  and BMP signaling  and is involved in negative regulation of skeletal muscle cell differentiation  which might have been selected for in Gir  a breed developed for milk production []. In humans  mutations leading to loss of function of this gene are associated with diseases causing sclerosing bone lesions and increased bone density  such as osteopoikilosis [  ]. This selection signature was reported by Ramey et al. []  between 48.67 and 48.9 Mb on BTA5  using an approach based on sliding windows estimations of minor allele frequency (MAF). In the taurine D/B comparison  two genes possibly related with variation in muscle accretion were identified i.e.  and [].  encodes a non-sarcomeric myosin complex component with calcium ion binding regulatory functions that are involved in signal transduction mechanisms  cytoskeleton formation  cell division and chromosome partitioning []. [] encodes a component of the Z-disc and the myosin II complex. Phosphorylation of MYL12B regulates the activity of non-muscle myosin II  resulting in higher MgATPase activity and the assembly of myosin II filaments. It is also involved in axon guidance processes  muscle contraction and regulation of muscle cell shape []. When extending detection of signatures of selection to the 0.1 percentile of VarLD scores  a third gene in this region overlapped with the signal:  () []  which encodes a 85 kDa protein that is a structural constituent of muscle. Together with its associated proteins  the MYOM1 protein interconnects the major structure of sarcomeres  the M bands and the Z discs  and is involved in muscle contraction [].  is one of the top 10 genes with preferential expression in muscle tissue [] and has been associated with intramuscular fat content []. In addition  the most significant physiological and system development functions associated with genes involved in meat tenderness include skeletal and muscular system development and tissue morphology  both of which have been related with muscle contraction in the pig []. The  () gene (ENSBTAG00000000874) [] identified on BTA7 between 98.44 and 98.58 Mb in the NEL/ANG comparison  with the signal originating from ANG  has been intensively studied in different breeds and selected for to improve meat tenderness and other traits associated with beef quality [–]. The gene encodes an endogenous calpain (calcium-dependent cysteine protease) inhibitor that is involved in the proteolysis of amyloid precursor proteins. The calpain/calpastatin system is involved in numerous membrane fusion events  such as neural vesicle exocytosis and platelet and red-cell aggregation  and it is hypothesized that it affects the expression of genes encoding structural or regulatory proteins []. Due to its capacity to prevent proteolysis []  some polymorphisms in this gene have been shown to be associated with increased meat tenderness in beef cattle breeds []. The  gene cluster (        among others) [] was identified as having a selection signature in the taurine D/B comparison. This cluster encodes neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins that are integral plasma membrane proteins and most likely play critical roles in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell neural connections []. In addition  these proteins are involved in nervous system development  synapse assembly  and synaptic transmission []. As reported by MacGregor []   contains a high-affinity cell surface binding site for Prion proteins and a number of  genes also function as tumor suppressor genes [  ]. Three  genes     and  were previously reported as a selection signature using an Fst approach [] and were found to overlap with CNV regions. The  () (ENSBTAG00000016355) [] gene located on BTA15 between 56.2 and 56.3 Mb  was found to have a selection signature in the comparison between the BSW and ANG breeds. This gene is associated with DNA repair and positive regulation of autophagy []. The human homologue of this gene [] has been shown to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of  group C cells [] and encodes a protein with a C2 domain []. This protein activates a Beclin1 complex that promotes autophagy and suppresses the proliferation and tumorigenicity of human colon cancer cells []. The  () (ENSBTAG00000045858) gene []  located on BTA7 between 53.8 and 54 Mb  was identified in the comparison between the BSW and ANG breeds. It encodes a heat shock protein binding gene []  which is a co-chaperone of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70)  and the / complex directly inhibits apoptosis []. Because of its anti-apoptotic role  it has been considered as having an important role in meat tenderness in beef cattle. Association studies showed that this gene explained up to 63% of the phenotypic variability of tenderness in Charolais []. The selection signature identified in the  gene could be a good indicator of selection for meat tenderness in the ANG breed during the last decades. Several genes previously reported using other methods to detect SS were also identified in our study. The first example is the ) gene (ENSBTAG00000044017) [] located on BTA5 between 48.56 and 48.74 Mb for which a SS was found in the NEL/GIR comparison between 48.65 and 49.35 Mb  which was also found by Ramey et al. in Brahman populations []. This gene has been associated with the ‘long ear’ phenotype  which characterizes the Gir breed  and against which the Nelore breed has been strongly selected; this reveals a clear sign of differential selection between the indicine breeds [].  was first identified through a genome-wide association study as a candidate for a QTL involved in ear floppiness and morphology in dogs []; it is an indicator of strong artificial selection for a specific phenotype  and of the time at which the breed was formed. A second example is the  () gene (ENSBTAG00000002305) [] on BTA7. The SS was identified in the NEL/GIR comparison at 45.5 Mb. This gene was also reported in SS studies by [] and [] in Jersey and Santa Gertrudis breeds. It is responsible for serine-type endopeptidase activity  which is involved in acrosome reaction  binding of sperm to the zona pellucida  sperm capacitation  and fertilization  which are all key functions of male fertility []. A third example is the  () gene located on BTA14 between 26.6 and 26.9 Mb (ENSBTAG00000004954) []. This gene encodes a possible bovine blood group antigen transcript. Blood group antigens have been shown to be under balancing selection in humans []  and this gene was also reported to be under positive selection in the Normande and Montbéliarde French dairy breeds by Flori et al. []. Surprisingly  although haplotype-based and LD methods are expected to perform similarly []  when the Rsb method for detecting selection signatures []  which evaluates differences between breeds by estimating extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) for each SNP location  was applied in our data  the results were quite different  and only two regions shared a signal. Another method  <U+0394>DAF []  which is based on the difference in the derived allele frequency between populations  was also tested and no common signals were identified. Considering the differences that the adopted LD method could have with other methods to identify SS  LD methods may detect regions that haplotype based-methods such as EHH []  iHs []  Voight’s iHs []  and Rsb [] might not detect  because genomic processes such as insertion/deletion (in/del) and other CNV produce LD patterns that may not be accounted for in the haplotype construction. The fact that LD methods cannot deal with monomorphic SNPs  makes VarLD less sensitive for regions with completely fixed SNPs or with many fixed SNPs for one population. Such signatures might be detected using methods like smoothed Fst [  ] and MAF-based [] approaches. Several of the identified selection signatures  especially for the indicine breeds  pointed to non-genic regions  including some CNV regions  such as (i) the signal on BTA6 between 66.75 and 66.78 Mb observed in the NEL/GIR comparison that coincides with a CNV on BTA6 between 66.75 and 66.76 Mb  and (ii) a CNV on BTA8 between 46.31 and 46.34 Mb that coincides with two overlapping SS observed in the GIR/BSW and GIR/ANG comparisons. These results suggest that different types of genomic variation  other than SNPs  may have a role in selection mechanisms. Given that CNV have been shown to influence gene expression through dosage-dependent interactions []  it is possible that the identified VarLD regions correspond to selection for a specific gene copy number or for a certain duplicated paralog that is present in the duplication. Across the whole genome  most CNV have evolved under neutral evolutionary pressures and their frequency and sequence context have been shaped by demographic events  mutation  and genetic drift [    ]. However  CNV that are located in functional regions of overlapping genes  are mostly under purifying (negative) selection and only a few examples of positive selection on these CNV are known []. Regions that differ in copy number between subspecies can be informative about ancient adaptations that may have led to species-specific phenotypes. Recent copy number changes can be an indicator that artificial selection may have led to genetic and phenotypic differences between breeds. In previous studies using the VarLD method to analyze human data  a large fraction of the top signals corresponded to CNV for some of the populations compared []. Comparing our signals from the top 0.1% VarLD scores to recently published reports on the detection of bovine CNV [  ]  we found that 20.6% of our signals overlapped with reported CNV. Since these signals cover only 0.43% of the genome and the CNV discovery sets included 2.1 and 5.6% of the genome  respectively [  ]  it is hypothesized that CNV are associated with differences in LD between populations and with selection processes [–]. VarLD is a powerful tool to identify differences in LD between cattle populations and possible signals of directional selection between them. The strongest signals differentiate LD patterns between breeds within subspecies and seem to point towards very recent selection. The narrow signatures of selection peaks that were detected in this analysis seem to indicate that both the methodology and the SNP density applied were appropriate to identify genes that underlie the identified selective sweeps. Some of the genes found in the I/T comparisons indicate potential adaptive signatures  while the D/B comparisons point out genomic regions related to production of milk and beef. A high number of the genomic regions identified with the VarLD method were shown to be associated with physiological pathways of adaptation and production processes  and some of the genes present in these regions have also been reported to coincide with signatures of selection in other species. The fact that 20.6% of the top VarLD signals overlap with recently reported CNV regions  which cover less than 7.7% of the genome  is a strong indicator of the role of CNV in selection within a breed type. In contrast  it is surprising that results from previous studies using the same breed comparisons and partially overlapping data sets  which applied haplotype-based methods to detect signatures of selection  had almost no overlap with the signals we detected using the VarLD method.

A region on  chromosome (SSC) 4 has been previously reported to have a strong association with serum viremia and weight gain in pigs experimentally infected with the PRRS virus (PRRSV). The objective here was to identify haplotypes associated with the favorable phenotype  investigate additional genomic regions associated with host response to PRRSV  and to determine the predictive ability of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) based on the SSC4 region and based on the rest of the genome. Phenotypic data and 60 K SNP genotypes from eight trials of ~200 pigs from different commercial crosses were used to address these objectives.ResultsAcross the eight trials  heritability estimates were 0.44 and 0.29 for viral load (VL  area under the curve of log-transformed serum viremia from 0 to 21 days post infection) and weight gain to 42 days post infection (WG)  respectively. Genomic regions associated with VL were identified on chromosomes 4  X  and 1. Genomic regions associated with WG were identified on chromosomes 4  5  and 7. Apart from the SSC4 region  the regions associated with these two traits each explained less than 3% of the genetic variance. Due to the strong linkage disequilibrium in the SSC4 region  only 19 unique haplotypes were identified across all populations  of which four were associated with the favorable phenotype. Through cross-validation  accuracies of EBV based on the SSC4 region were high (0.55)  while the rest of the genome had little predictive ability across populations (0.09).ConclusionsTraits associated with response to PRRSV infection in growing pigs are largely controlled by genomic regions with relatively small effects  with the exception of SSC4.

A region on  chromosome (SSC) 4 has been previously reported to have a strong association with serum viremia and weight gain in pigs experimentally infected with the PRRS virus (PRRSV). The objective here was to identify haplotypes associated with the favorable phenotype  investigate additional genomic regions associated with host response to PRRSV  and to determine the predictive ability of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) based on the SSC4 region and based on the rest of the genome. Phenotypic data and 60 K SNP genotypes from eight trials of ~200 pigs from different commercial crosses were used to address these objectives. Across the eight trials  heritability estimates were 0.44 and 0.29 for viral load (VL  area under the curve of log-transformed serum viremia from 0 to 21 days post infection) and weight gain to 42 days post infection (WG)  respectively. Genomic regions associated with VL were identified on chromosomes 4  X  and 1. Genomic regions associated with WG were identified on chromosomes 4  5  and 7. Apart from the SSC4 region  the regions associated with these two traits each explained less than 3% of the genetic variance. Due to the strong linkage disequilibrium in the SSC4 region  only 19 unique haplotypes were identified across all populations  of which four were associated with the favorable phenotype. Through cross-validation  accuracies of EBV based on the SSC4 region were high (0.55)  while the rest of the genome had little predictive ability across populations (0.09). Traits associated with response to PRRSV infection in growing pigs are largely controlled by genomic regions with relatively small effects  with the exception of SSC4. Accuracies of EBV based on the SSC4 region were high compared to the rest of the genome. These results show that selection for the SSC4 region could potentially reduce the effects of PRRS in growing pigs  ultimately reducing the economic impact of this disease. For decades the swine industry has been battling the economically important disease of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)  caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) but success has been limited. Since the infection mechanisms of the virus are not fully understood  vaccine development is a challenge []. There has been no genetic selection of pigs for PRRS resistance or tolerance due to the lack of good DNA markers for marker-assisted selection and lack of a good indicator trait for indirect selection. Recently  a quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on  (SSC) 4 that explains a considerable amount of the total genetic variance for serum viremia and weight gain of weaned piglets following experimental infection []. In subsequent work  the effect of this ~1 Mb region was identified in three unrelated populations  encompassing five experimental challenge trials of 200 weaned pigs []. Many of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this ~1 Mb region are in very high linkage disequilibrium  which makes identification of the causative mutation difficult; a single tag SNP (SNP WUR10000125) appears to track the effect of the region with the B allele being associated with PRRS tolerance [  ]. The fore mentioned studies did not thoroughly investigate the rest of the genome  which may contain pertinent information for host response to PRRSV infection. The addition of three trials to the data analyzed in Boddicker et al. [] has potentially increased the power in order to find these  likely smaller  effects. The objectives of the current study were to (1) re-estimate genetic parameters for host response to experimental PRRSV infection in growing pigs by including three additional  unrelated populations  (2) investigate additional genomic regions associated with weight gain and viremia in response to PRRSV challenge  (3) determine if there is a smaller informative haplotype block within the ~1 Mb region on SSC4 associated with host response to PRRSV infection  (4) determine which haplotypes within the SSC4 region are associated with the favorable effects of the QTL for viremia and weight gain  and (5) investigate accuracies of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for host response to PRRS based on the SSC4 region and the rest of the genome  by using cross-validation. The Kansas State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental protocols for this study. A detailed description of the design  data collection  and molecular techniques used in the PRRS host genetic consortium trials has been previously published []. Briefly  each challenge trial of ~200 commercial pigs involved transporting animals at weaning (18–28 days of age) to Kansas State University  where they were subjected to a PRRSV challenge. Within a trial  pigs were from the same high health farm  except for trials 5 and 8  which each included pigs from two farms. All farms were free of PRRSV    and swine influenza virus. Upon arrival  pigs were randomly placed into pens of 10 to 15 pigs. After a 7-day acclimation period  pigs between 25 and 35 days of age (day 0)  were experimentally infected intramuscularly and intranasally with 10 (TCID50) of NVSL 97–7985  a highly virulent PRRSV isolate []. Blood samples were collected at -6  0  4  7  11  14  21  28  35  and 42 days post-infection (dpi). Body weight was measured at 0  7  14  21  28  35  and 42 dpi. Pigs were euthanized at 42 dpi. Trials 7 and 8 were stopped at 35 dpi due to facility availability. Viremia was measured using a semi-quantitative TaqMan PCR assay for PRRSV RNA  as described in Boddicker et al. []. Assay results were reported as the log of PRRSV RNA copies per mL of serum. Ear tissue was collected from all pigs for DNA isolation. Tissue or genomic DNA from the sires of pigs in trials 1 through 3 and from available sires and dams for trials 4 through 8 was supplied by the breeding companies. Tissues or DNA samples were sent to GeneSeek Inc. (Lincoln  Nebraska) for genotyping with Illumina’s Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (San Diego  California). Data from eight trials of up to 200 pigs were analyzed (Table ). Trials 1 through 3 were described in Boddicker et al. [] and included pigs of the same cross from a single breeding company. Trials 4 and 5 were described in Boddicker et al. [] and included two unrelated populations from different breeding companies. Trials 6 through 8 are unique to this paper and were sourced from three additional breeding companies  with pigs that were unrelated to those in Boddicker et al. [  ]. Pigs in trial 7 were sourced from the same breeding company as those in trial 4 but were produced using different sire and dam lines. Table  provides an overview of the population structure by trial. See Boddicker et al. [] for further details on trials 1 through 3 and Boddicker et al. [] for further detail on trials 4 and 5. Pigs in trial 6 were purebred Landrace (LR). Pigs in trial 7 were from Pietrain sires and Large White (LW)/LR/Yorkshire dams. Trial 8 pigs were from Duroc sires and Yorkshire/LR dams. Across all eight trials  175 pigs died before 42 dpi (Table ). Dead pigs were necropsied and subsequent gross and microscopic pathology by a board-certified pathologist identified PRRS associated disease as the major source of mortality  except for trial 6. Death loss was high in trial 6  46% by day 42  due to secondary bacterial infections  as identified by pathology  including  and  Details on the phenotypic traits analyzed are in Boddicker et al. [  ]. Briefly  VL was quantified as the area under the curve for log-transformed serum viremia at 0  4  7  11  14  and 21 dpi. Weight gain to 42 dpi (WG) was calculated as body weight (BW) at 42 dpi minus BW at day 0 dpi; for trials 7 and 8 WG35 was calculated. Mortality was defined as death prior to the end of the experiment. Edits for trials 1–3 are in Boddicker et al. [] and in Boddicker et al. [] for trials 4 and 5. Briefly  edits for VL removed 34 individuals from the first 3 trials and 15 for trials 4 and 5. For WG  47 and 18 individuals were removed  respectively. Edits removed 88 individuals from trials 6 through 8  with 86 due to death prior to 21 dpi and two with missing viremia data. For WG42  111 individuals were removed from trials 6 through 8  all due to death prior to 42 dpi. The total number of individuals available after edits is in Table . Recorded pedigrees (sire and dam) were checked and corrected using SNP genotypes  as described in Boddicker et al. []. Briefly  parent-offsping mismatch frequencies were calculated as the number of SNPs for which the parent and offspring had opposing homozygous genotypes divided by the total number of polymorphic SNPs for which the parent and offspring were both homozygous. If a parent-offspring pair had a mismatch frequency of less than 2%  then the named parent was accepted. Otherwise  offspring genotypes were compared to all possible parents and the most likely parent was chosen. The original pedigrees provided by the breeding companies were mostly correct but a few full- and half-sib families were reassigned to different sires and dams. Heritabilities and variances due to litter were estimated based on validated and corrected pedigree relationships  as determined from SNP genotypes (see Boddicker et al. [] for details)  with a single-trait animal model using the software ASREML []. Sex and the interaction of trial and parity of the sow were included as fixed factors and pen within trial  animal  and litter as random effects. Piglets were born from parities 1 to 7. Parities 3 through 7 were combined into one parity class. The effect of farm of origin for trials 5 and 8 was not significant (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.43) and was excluded from the analyses. The genetic correlation between traits was estimated using a bivariate animal model with the same fixed and random factors as used in the single-trait models. Associations of SNP genotypes with phenotypes were analyzed by fitting all SNPs simultaneously using Bayesian genomic selection methods []  as implemented in the software GenSel []  using the following mixed model: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of phenotypic observations  <U+2009>=<U+2009>incidence matrix relating fixed factors to phenotypes  <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of fixed factors of sex  pen within trial  and the interaction of trial and parity class  <U+2009>=<U+2009>vector of the genotype covariate for SNP  (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to ) based on the number of B alleles using Illumina’s (San Diego  California) genotype calling (coded 0  1  2  or equal to the trial average for missing genotypes)  <U+2009>=<U+2009>allele substitution effect for SNP   and <U+2009>=<U+2009>indicator for whether SNP  was included (<U+2009>=<U+2009>1) or excluded (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0) in the model for a given iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Pen within trial was included as a fixed factor  as opposed to a random effect in ASREML  because the current version of GenSel does not allow additional random effects. A total of 50 000 iterations were run for each analysis  with the first 5000 iterations discarded as burn-in. The probability of <U+2009>=<U+2009>0 was set equal to p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99. The Bayesian model was implemented using method Bayes-B []. Genomic regions associated with traits were identified using 1 Mb  non-overlapping windows using build 10.2 of the swine genome (  accessed November 1  2011). The QTL previously identified on SSC4 included 38 SNPs  two of which had 0 called genotypes []. The remaining 36 SNPs in the ~1 Mb region on SSC4 were analyzed to remove uninformative groups of SNPs  with the goal of reducing the size of the ~1 Mb region. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs in the ~1 Mb region was determined using Haploview []. Using a univariate animal model in ASREML that included sex  the interaction of trial and parity of the sow  and genotype for SNP WUR10000125 as fixed factors and pen within trial  animal  and litter as random effects  each of the remaining 35 SNPs was fitted as an additional covariate  one at a time  to determine if the additional SNP accounted for effects not captured by SNP WUR10000125. The threshold for discarding a SNP from the region was p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Parental and offspring genotypes for the 36 informative SNPs in the ~1 Mb region on SSC4 were ordered using the PHASE software []  separately for each trial. Haplotypes with high probabilities  as identified by PHASE software  were analyzed with MEGA5 software [] to establish a phylogenetic tree. The neighbor-joining method  with the p-distance option  was used to create the tree. Haplotypes identified in the ~1 Mb region and for the reduced region were analyzed. Using the results from the phylogenetic tree for the reduced region  haplotypes that carried the B allele at SNP WUR10000125 were allocated to two groups based on phylogenetic distance from one another. The main effect of haplotype group was fitted as a fixed class factor in the abovementioned ASREML analysis to determine which haplotypes were associated with the desirable phenotypes of VL and WG. Due to the apparent dominance effect of the B allele  an individual had to have at least one copy of a haplotype that carried the B allele to be placed in that group. If the two groups of haplotypes that carried the B allele were not significantly different from each other but were significantly different from the group of haplotypes that carried the A allele  both B haplotypes groups were assumed to carry the favorable allele of the causative mutation. A similar procedure was used for the A haplotypes to determine whether all A haplotypes were associated with an unfavorable phenotype. Accuracy of genomic predictions across populations was evaluated by cross-validation  which involved training on one population and validating on another population. Populations were defined by trial  except for trials 1 through 3  which were considered as one population  since pigs included in those three trials were crossbreds from the same lines and breeding company. Each population was validated twice  using a ‘reduced’ and a ‘full’ training population (Table ). The training populations included all populations except for the population that was being validated  with some exceptions. For the reduced training populations  only one of the first three trials was used. Trial 3 was used for this purpose because it had the highest estimates of heritability of the three trials for both VL and WG (0.45 and 0.50  respectively). For the full training populations  trials 1 through 3 were included when validating on trials 4 through 8. When validating on trials 1 and 2  trial 3 was included in the training population  which resulted in some of the animals in the validation population to be related to animals in the training population. To allow predictive ability of the rest of the genome  excluding the SSC4 region  to be assessed  estimates of allele substitution effects for the training population were acquired using the additive Bayesian model described above but with genotype at SNP WUR10000125 included as a fixed class effect to account for the additive and non-additive effects of the QTL in this region on VL and WG []. Method Bayes-CPi was used rather than Bayes-B because it assumes a homogenous variance across all SNPs  which appeared appropriate given the results of the GWAS  and estimates parameter p from the data []. The starting value of p was set to 0.99. The GEBV of individual  in the validation population for the rest of the genome (excluding the SSC4 region) was predicted as: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>number of SNPs included in the prediction (58 277 SNPs)  <U+2009>=<U+2009>genotype covariate of SNP  for animal  (coded 0  1  2  or trial average for missing genotypes)  and  = allele substitution effect estimate for SNP  based on analysis of the training population. To estimate the accuracy of predictions based on the SSC4 region alone  the estimates of the additive and dominance effects of SNP WUR10000125 from the GenSel analysis of the training population were used to estimate the genotypic value based on the observed genotype for SNP WUR10000125 of each individual in the validation population. Accuracy of prediction  defined as the correlation between the GEBV and the true BV  were estimated as the correlation between the GEBV and adjusted phenotypes in the validation population divided by the square root of heritability (Table ) obtained when analyzing all eight trials together []. Here  adjusted phenotypes were phenotypes adjusted for estimates of fixed effects (sex  pen within trial  and the interaction of trial and parity class) within the validation population. Estimates of accuracies of GEBV across all eight trials were then obtained by correlating adjusted phenotypes with GEBV deviated from their respective trial means  and dividing by the square root of heritability. Estimates of heritability  litter effects  and phenotypic and genetic correlations for VL and WG are in Table . Heritabilities for VL and WG were moderate at 0.44 and 0.29  respectively  and were of similar magnitude as those reported by Boddicker et al. [] using a subset (trials 1–5) of the data analyzed here. In comparison to the estimates from the first five trials  the proportion of variance explained by litter effects decreased for VL (0.11 to 0.09) and increased for WG42 (0.09 to 0.12). These estimates of heritability provide solid evidence that genetic improvement of host response to PRRSV infection is possible. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between VL and WG were moderate and negative. Results of single-marker analyses for the most significant SNP in the SSC4 region (WUR10000125) that was identified by Boddicker et al. [] for VL and WG42 for all trials combined  and trials 6 through 8 individually  are in Figure . Results for SNP WUR10000125 for trials 1 through 3 are in Boddicker et al. [] and in Boddicker et al. [] for trials 4 and 5. This SNP was significant for WG42 (Figure A) for trials 6 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and 8 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.004)  where susceptible AA animals gained 4.8 kg and 3.5 kg less  respectively  than AB animals. Although the effect was in the same direction for trial 7 for WG42  there was no statistical significance between the genotypes for this trial (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.57). For VL (Figure B)  the SNP was significant for trials 6 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.005) and 7 (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) but not for trial 8 (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.56). For trial 8  the effects of the SNP on VL were  however  in the same direction as for the other trials (i.e. increased VL for AA animals compared to AB animals). The non-significant effects of the WUR SNP on WG in trial 7 and on VL in trial 8 are probably false negatives because the effect of the SNP was significant for the other trait in each of these trials; it is less likely that the significant effects in trials 7 and 8 are false positives because the effect is present in the other trials for both traits []. These results show that the effect of this region was present in six unrelated populations from five different breeding companies. <U+2009>Viral load was calculated as area under the curve of log-transformed viremia from 0 to 21 days post infection. Within a trial  columns with a different letter are significantly different at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Numbers of individuals within genotype are listed in the bars. The region on SSC4 spans 1 284 081 base pairs and includes a total of 38 SNPs that are on the 60 k SNP panel  including two that are fixed and two for which no genotypes were called. Figure  shows a LD plot of the 34 polymorphic SNPs across trials 1 through 8. Haploview identified five haplotype blocks  including a block (Block 2) of 15 SNPs that spanned 487 kb that had very high LD amongst most SNPs. This block harbors SNP WUR10000125  which captured over 99% of the effects of the SSC4 region on VL and WG []. In general  LD is not expected to be the same between breeds and unrelated populations over such long distances. As an example  Amaral et al. [] found very different LD patterns between a LW population  Ningxiang (a Chinese breed)  and the European wild boar  across three different genomic regions. Differences in LD can result from mutation  recombination  selection  and drift. Block 2 is unique in the sense that LD was very high across six unrelated populations that consisted of different breeds (Figure ).   <U+2009>Black squares signify r<U+2009>=<U+2009>100% and white squares signify r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0%. Table  shows the p-value for the effects of each SNP in the SSC4 region on VL and WG42  when the effect of SNP WUR10000125 is accounted for in the model. The SNPs located before and after Block 2 all had p-values greater than 0.05 for both VL and WG42  indicating that these SNPs do not capture a significant amount of additional variation in VL or WG42 that is not already accounted for by SNP WUR10000125. Therefore  these SNPs are probably not in high LD with the causative mutation and were excluded from the candidate region. Many of the SNPs within Block 2 also had p-values greater than 0.05 but  with the high LD present and confounding among SNPs  Block 2 was not further reduced in size. Given these results  the ~1 Mb candidate region was reduced to a 487 kb region that probably harbors the causative mutation. A total of 77 unique haplotypes were identified in the original ~1 Mb region across all eight trials  11 of which carried the B allele at SNP WUR10000125 (B haplotypes). After reducing the region to 487 kb  only 19 unique haplotypes remained  of which four carried the B allele. Table  shows the frequency of each B haplotype  along with the trials each haplotype was present in. Eight of the original eleven B haplotypes were combined into one haplotype (haplotype 17) after the region was reduced. This was the most common haplotype and it was present in all trials and in every parental breed. Therefore  it is probably the ancestral haplotype  with the remaining B haplotypes originating from recombination or mutation since the breeds were established. Figure  shows the phylogenetic tree for haplotypes in the 487 kb region  generated using Mega 5 software. Using only the unique haplotypes  the tree clearly grouped the haplotypes based on the allele present at SNP WUR10000125  with the B haplotypes grouped at the bottom of the tree in Figure .    The trees were created using the neighbor-joining  p-distance method in the Mega 5 software. Haplotypes with the B allele for SNP WUR10000125 are labeled with a B following the haplotype number. Starting with haplotype 17 in Figure   haplotypes were grouped by phylogenetic distance based on two cuts in the phylogenetic tree to determine whether all B haplotypes carried the favorable causative variant. If an individual had at least one of the haplotypes to the right of the cut  the individual was placed in the group to the right of the cut  because of the identified dominance mode of action of the QTL []. To create grouping 1  the tree was cut to the left of haplotype 17B and to the left of 18B  to create the following haplotype groups: haplotype 17B vs. 15B plus 18B vs. all A haplotypes. Only one copy of haplotype 19B was present across trials and that animal’s other haplotype was 17B  so this animal was assigned to haplotype 17. Other groupings were created by moving the first cut up the tree  resulting in the groupings specified in Figure . Least squares means of the effect of each haplotype group for each grouping are in Figure . Results showed that all B haplotypes were associated with the favorable phenotype  and were significantly different from haplotypes that carried the A allele (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) for both VL and WG42  except for grouping 2. For grouping 2  haplotype 18 had significantly lower VL than the other B haplotypes but was not significantly different from B or A haplotypes for WG. Haplotype 18 had a total of 21 copies (20 individuals) and was specific to trial 5; therefore  the results for group 2 may represent effects specific to this trial and this may confound the estimates of the effects of this haplotype. Haplotype 14  which was at the base of the A haplotypes (Figure )  was not significantly different from the other A haplotypes (p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.83) and tended towards significance from the B haplotypes (grouping 4  p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.09) for VL. For WG42  haplotype 14 was not significantly different from the other B and A haplotypes. Haplotype 14 only had 11 copies and the SE associated with the effect of haplotype 14 were large. Moving further up the tree  the group with A haplotypes 14  13  and 11 was not significantly different from the other A haplotypes but was significantly different from the B haplotypes for both VL and WG. In summary  the phylogenetic analysis segregated the haplotypes primarily by the allele at SNP WUR10000125  and there was a significant difference between the A versus B haplotype groups. Due to the high LD in the 487 kb region  relatively few haplotypes existed across the different populations for this region. This may indicate that there is little recombination in this region. In fact  across all ~1600 animals evaluated  only one recombination could be identified within the ~1 Mb region on SSC4. This recombination occurred between SNPs 31 and 32 in Figure   outside the 487 kb region. Therefore  this is a region with very little recombination  explaining the relatively few haplotypes that were present across all trials. <U+2009>Haplotype numbers refer to those identified in Figure ; “A” refers to all A haplotypes. Within a grouping  columns with a different letter are significantly different at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05. Numbers of individuals within each haplotype group are listed in the bars. Black bars represent haplotypes with the B allele for SNP WUR10000125 and white bars represent haplotypes with the A allele for SNP WUR10000125. The results from the GWAS for VL are presented in Figure A. The top ten 1 Mb windows that explained the greatest percentage of genetic variance are in Table . The region on SSC4 explained the largest percentage of genetic variance at 13.2%. The remaining top 10 regions quickly dropped to less than 1% of the genetic variance and ranged from 1.24% to 0.39%. The second and third ranked regions will be further discussed. <U+2009>Results are based on method Bayes-B with p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.99  and show the percentage of genetic variance that is explained be each non-overlapping 1 Mb window  labeled by index number of the first 1 Mb window and ordered by chromosome (1–18  X  and Y). Virus load was calculated as area under the curve of log-transformed viremia from 0 to 21 days post infection. A region on SSCX  which included two consecutive 1 Mb regions  accounted for 1.73% of the genetic variance across all trials for VL but only 0.02% of the genetic variance for WG (Figure A  Table ). There have been no reports of QTL associated with traits related to growth within 3 Mb up or down stream of this region (). The region does include one reported QTL for blood pH in Meishan and Pietrain pigs infected with []. A region on SSC1 accounted for 0.70% of the genetic variance for VL across all trials and was the third highest region for VL (Figure A  Table ). This region also explained only a small percentage of genetic variance for WG (0.03%). Three QTL associated with health traits have been reported for this region  including C3c concentration  alkaline phosphatase activity  and white blood cell counts (). However  none of these QTL were identified under a PRRS challenge. Interesting candidate genes within 2 Mb on either side of this 1 Mb window include  () and  ()  (). The  gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with programmed cell death []. The  gene is associated with antiviral activity []. The results from the GWAS for WG are presented in Figure B and the top 10 windows that explained the greatest percentage of genetic variance are in Table . Again  the region on SSC4 explained the largest percentage of genetic variance  at 9.1%. The percentage of genetic variance explained by the remaining regions ranged from 0.43% to 2.61%. A region on SSC5 was the second highest and accounted for 2.6% of the genetic variance across all trials (Figure B  Table ). This window does not appear to have an association with VL  as the percentage of genetic variance for VL was only 0.06%. Reports of QTL in this region associated with health in the pig include QTL for cholesterol level  haptoglobin concentration  alkaline phosphatase activity  interleukin-2 level  and interferon-gamma level (). Interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma are both cytokines that respond to pathogen invasion of host cells. Interferon-gamma has been shown to inhibit PRRSV replication in macrophages [  ]. There were two reports of QTL associated with average daily gain of healthy pigs that span the SSC5 region identified here (). A 1 Mb window on SSC7 (Mb 27) accounted for 1.45% of the genetic variance in WG across all trials (Figure B  Table ) but only 0.06% of the genetic variance for VL. This region is within a ~5 Mb region (Mb 24 – 29) that contains several  () genes within the swine Major Histocompatibility Complex (  accessed March  2013). To date  there have been 19 reports of QTL associated with production traits in this region  18 of which were associated with BW or average daily gain from birth to market weight (pig genome assembly 10.2  animalgenome.org  accessed March  2013). However  these QTL were identified using healthy  non-challenged pigs. The QTL identified here is for WG under PRRSV challenge and could be a new QTL; alternately one of the previously reported QTL could also be associated with WG under PRRSV challenge. Additional work is required to understand the underlying mechanism. Accuracies of predictions based on the SSC4 region and based on the whole genome including the SSC4 region  were previously reported by []  using trials 1 through 3 for training and trials 4 and 5 for validation. On average  accuracies of GEBV based only on the SSC4 region were higher (0.24 for VL and 0.33 for WG) than accuracies of GEBV based on the whole genome  including SSC4 (0.20 and 0.31  respectively). Given those results  the hypothesis here was that the rest of the genome has much lower predictive ability than the region on SSC4. Accuracies of predictions based on SNP WUR10000125 and GEBV for the rest of the genome excluding the SSC4 region are shown in Figure A and B for VL and WG. Accuracies were  on average  much higher for SNP WUR10000125 than for the rest of the genome. Accuracies of predictions of genotypic values based on SNP WUR10000125 were very similar for the full and reduced training data but varied between validation trials from 0.08 to 0.51 for VL  with an accuracy of 0.48 and 0.54 when all trials were analyzed jointly  using the full and reduced training data  respectively  and from 0.06 to 0.75 for WG  with an accuracy of ~0.34 for the joint analyses.  Accuracy based on the correlation between predictions and phenotypes adjusted for fixed effects  divided by the square root of heritability  for predictions obtained using reduced or full training populations (see Table ). Predictions were based on the effect of SNP WUR10000125 (WUR) of <U+2009>chromosome (SSC) 4 only  and based on the rest of the genome excluding the effect of the SSC4 region (Rest)  for virus load (  calculated as area under the curve of log-transformed viremia between 0 and 21 days post infection) and weight gain to 42 days post infection . For GEBV based on the rest of the genome and the reduced training data  accuracies centered around zero for VL  ranging from -0.23 to +0.18 for individual validation trials  with an accuracy of 0.10 and -0.04 for the joint analysis with the full and reduced training data  respectively. For WG  accuracies based on the rest of the genome tended to be positive  ranging from -0.14 to +0.31  with an accuracy of 0.21 and 0.07 for the joint analysis with the full and reduced training data. For the full training populations  accuracies increased substantially for trials 1 and 2  except for WG for trial 2  but had little impact on the other trials. These increases in accuracy for trials 1 and 2 were as expected because the full training data included data from the same crossbred genetics as used for validation. Reasons for the generally observed poor predictive performance of GEBV across populations can be attributed to dominance  epistatis  and differences in linkage disequilibrium []. Accuracies of GEBV are generally lower when training and validation populations are more distantly related. For example  Saatchi et al. [] partitioned data from Angus bulls into five groups using two methods; random allocation and k-means clustering  with the latter aiming at increasing relationships within groups and decreasing relationships between groups. On average  accuracies of GEBV when cross-validation in groups created by random allocation were higher than when groups were created by k-means clustering (0.65 vs 0.44). They concluded that this was due to closer relationships between training and validation populations when using random allocation. In the current study  the reduced training populations were not related to the validation populations. However  when validating on trials 1 and 2  trial 3 was included in the full training population  which resulted in some relatedness between training and validation populations. Inclusion of trial 3 in the training population resulted in increased accuracies for trials 1 and 2 compared to the absence of trial 3 in the reduced training population  which agrees with the results of Saatchi et al. []. However  SE were large for all estimates of accuracy. Furthermore  the increase in relationships between training and validation populations was confounded with the increased size of the training population. Traits associated with PRRS following experimental infection in growing pigs appear to have a strong genetic component  with moderate estimates of heritability for VL and WG  along with a large QTL on SSC4. Strong LD is present in the SSC4 region. However  combining all eight trials broke some of the LD in the ~1 Mb region  resulting in a smaller haplotype. This reduced haplotype block could be useful to identify the causative mutation. A phylogenetic analysis separated the haplotypes by the allele at the SNP that explains nearly all the genetic variance for VL and WG that is contributed by the region  providing additional evidence that SNP WUR10000125 is the most informative SNP in the region (along with three other SNPs that were in complete LD with the WUR SNP) and is likely in very high LD with the causative mutation. The most common B haplotype was present in all breeds and lines represented in this study and was likely present before the segregation of the breeds. Cross-validation for the SSC4 QTL resulted in high estimates of accuracy when validating across populations for VL and WG  which can benefit selection strategies without infecting piglets with PRRSV. After accounting for the SSC4 region  the rest of the genome had little predictive ability for VL and WG across unrelated populations. Additional work is required to determine predictive ability within a population. With the effect of the SSC4 region present in all breeds and lines analyzed here  there is a good possibility that the effect is present in more populations and that genetic progress for PRRS tolerance or resistance can be made. However  additional work is needed to verify the effects of this region on challenges with different PRRSV strains and in the field. Other genomic regions associated with VL and WG were identified also but with small effects. In general  these regions will probably not play a major role in reducing the economic impact of PRRS. The genomic region identified in this study can be used for marker-assisted selection for response to PRRS in growing pigs. The implementation of selection for these markers will not make pigs completely resistant to PRRS but will increase the well-being of the animals and reduce the financial impact of PRRSV infections by limiting reductions in growth rate and other negative effects of PRRS following infection. Further work is required to investigate the effects of these QTL against different PRRSV strains and in the field where pigs are subjected to many additional environmental stressors.

We present the first results of the implementation of genomic prediction in a  (Nellore) population. Influential bulls were genotyped with the Illumina Bovine HD chip in order to assess genomic predictive ability for weight and carcass traits  gestation length  scrotal circumference and two selection indices. 685 samples and 320 238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in the analyses.

Bayesian regression models are of interest for future applications of genomic selection in this population  but further improvements are needed to reduce deflation of their predictions. Recurrent updates of the training population would be required to enable accurate prediction of the genetic merit of young animals. The technical feasibility of applying genomic prediction in a  (Nellore) population was demonstrated. Further research is needed to permit cost-effective selection decisions using genomic information. The possibility of accurately predicting the genetic merit of individuals based on their genotypes analyzed by dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker panels  a process known as genomic selection (GS) [  ]  is revolutionizing the design and implementation of livestock breeding programs especially for dairy cattle. Schaeffer [] highlighted the potential benefits of this strategy for dairy cattle in terms of reducing generation intervals  increasing prediction accuracies and selection intensities  reducing breeding organization costs and making it feasible to perform genetic evaluations of difficult-to-measure traits. The rationale behind genomic selection in livestock is that  given a marker density high enough to cover the entire genome  most of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) will be in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with some of the markers. Therefore  the sum of all SNP effects (direct genomic value  DGV) will be a good predictor of the genetic merit of selection candidates and will enable selection decisions as soon as the genomic information of those individuals is available []. Thanks to the sequencing of the bovine genome [] and the availability of dense panels of SNP markers  GS has moved from simulation approaches to practical application in the last years. The first successful application of GS was in dairy cattle (Holstein) [  ] and motivated studies on GS in other breeds and populations [–]. Although several previous reports compared statistical methods applied to GS in cattle using the Illumina Bovine 50 K chip (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA) [    ]  only a few studies have carried out similar comparisons using high-density panels  such as the Illumina Bovine HD chip  which contains more than 700 000 SNPs []. In addition  most of the studies in this field were carried out using data from  breeds. While previous studies have investigated the application of GS in purebred and composite populations of  (Brahman) [  ]  the performance of GS in many other  populations is unknown. Nellore cattle are the primary breed used in beef production in tropical systems. Thus  it is expected that genome-enhanced predictions could considerably contribute to improve the efficiency of breeding programs in such systems. Brazil has a large number of well-recorded Nellore animals obtained from several genetic evaluation initiatives [] that have achieved significant genetic progress for growth traits in the last two decades through conventional selection  although progress for reproduction  meat quality and feed efficiency traits has been less significant during the same period []. Our aim was to create the scientific basis for the application of GS to Nellore cattle  by comparing genomic prediction results obtained with four different prediction methods on 15 traits of economic relevance in this breed. Phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 691 influential Nellore bulls. Genotypes were generated with the Illumina Bovine HD chip (Illumina  San Diego  CA  USA) and only autosomal SNPs with a GenCall (GC) score higher than 0.70 were considered for further analyses. Fifty-four SNP pairs that had the same map coordinates were excluded from the dataset. Quality control of genotypes was carried out through an iterative process using the following SNP selection criteria: call rate (CR) higher than 0.98  minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.02 and p-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test (HWE) higher than 10. The SNPs that met these criteria were further screened to interrogate their linkage disequilibrium with syntenic SNPs located within a window of 100 neighboring markers  resulting in only one marker from each pair of highly correlated SNPs (r<U+2009>><U+2009>0.995) remaining in the SNP dataset. Finally  samples showing CR lower than 0.90 were excluded from the analysis. The process was repeated until no further SNPs or samples were excluded  which resulted in a final dataset of 685 bulls with 320 238 SNPs. Phenotypes were provided by the DeltaGen genetic evaluation program  a commercial beef cattle operation managed as an alliance of breeders distributed across 12 Brazilian states []. The estimated breeding values (EBV) from routine genetic evaluations were deregressed and used as dependent variables to estimate SNP effects for 15 traits of economic relevance. These traits included weight and carcass traits  scrotal circumference  gestation length and two selection indexes [See Additional file  for detailed trait definitions]. The deregressed proofs (dEBV)  as well as their associated reliabilities  were obtained according to the procedure proposed by []  which removed parent average effects and also accounted for heterogeneous variances []. The genotyped individuals included 65 influential older bulls born between 1965 and 1990  while the remaining genotyped animals were younger. The dataset comprised up to four generations of genotyped animals  including 292 son-sire pairs  139 grandson-grandsire pairs and 51 paternal half-sib families (average size<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.7). [See Additional file  for more information about the age structure of the genotyped animals]. For each individual trait  a forward prediction scheme was adopted  which splits the dataset into a training (reference) population  that included bulls with EBV accuracies greater than 0.50 in 2007  and a testing population that included bulls that did not have accurate EBV in 2007 but had EBV accuracies greater than 0.50 in 2011. The sizes of the training and testing datasets differed between traits (Table ). Most traits were moderately heritable  with heritabilities (h) ranging from 0.25 (score for carcass conformation and finishing precocity at weaning) to 0.49 (gestation length)  with an average of about 0.30 (Table ). Such heritability estimates were based on REML estimates of variance components  obtained using the same database from which the EBV employed in this study were obtained. For all traits  average EBV accuracies were greater than 0.80 and 0.74 in the training and testing sets  respectively. In our study  model training was carried out using dEBV based on the 2007 genetic evaluation (dEBV)  while dEBV based on the 2011 genetic evaluation (dEBV) were used for validation purposes. Using dEBV for model training ensured that information of own performance (and/or progeny records) of the testing animals did not contribute to the dEBV of the training set  thus preventing overlapping information between training and testing sets  which could inflate the estimates of predictive ability of GS []. Because the dataset included many pairs of closely related animals  the forward prediction scheme resulted in many testing animals having close relatives in the training set. The pattern of relationships between animals in the training and validation sets was consistent across traits [See Additional file ]. The following statistical methods were used in order to estimate SNP effects and direct genomic values (DGV): (i) best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) using a genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP)  (ii) Bayesian regression using a mixture model (Bayes C) and (iii) Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO). All methods only accounted for the allele substitution (additive) effects of the markers  i.e. apart from an overall mean  no other effects (environmental or genetic) were included in the models. GBLUP model can be described as: where  is the vector of dEBV for the respective trait  µ is the location parameter common to all observations   is a vector of 1's   is the incidence matrix relating genomic breeding values to    is the vector of genomic breeding values and  is the vector of random residual terms. It was assumed that <U+2009>~<U+2009>N (0   s) and <U+2009>~<U+2009>N (0   s)  where  is a combined relationship matrix and  is a diagonal matrix  whose elements account for the differences in the reliabilities of the observations in   similarly as in []. The diagonal elements of  (R) were obtained as R<U+2009>=<U+2009>(1-)/()  where  is the reliability associated with the i dEBV  obtained following []. The  matrix is a combined relationship matrix  computed as <U+2009>=<U+2009>(1-w)<U+2009>+<U+2009>w  where  is the genomic relationship matrix and  is the regular numerator relationship matrix  both of order equal to the number of genotyped bulls.  was defined as <U+2009>=<U+2009>'/S2p(1-p)  in which  is the incidence matrix of marker scores whose elements in the i column are 0-2p  1-2p and 2-2p  depending on whether the animal’s genotype was 11  12 or 22  respectively  and p is the allele frequency of allele 2 at the i marker []. In the computation of the genomic relationship matrix   attributing a weight (w) for pedigree-based relationships is equivalent to fitting residual polygenic effects that are not captured by the markers []. After testing different values for w (ranging from 0 to 0.40)  Gao et al. [] reported that w<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20 provided the best compromise in terms of reliability and scale of DGV. Since our aim was to investigate the benefit of this strategy  GBLUP predictions were obtained setting w<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 or w<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20  hereafter referred to as GBLUP0 and GBLUP20  respectively. Theoretically  allele frequencies from the unselected base population should be used to construct  []  which could be estimated after using linear regression to predict gene content (number of copies of a particular allele in a genotype of an individual) of non-genotyped ancestors  based on the available information of genotypes and pedigree []. However  there is some evidence that similar accuracies of prediction are obtained using either base population or current allele frequencies [  ]. Hence  in this study   was constructed using current allele frequencies (computed considering all genotyped animals). The GBLUP method was implemented using the gebv software described in []. This formulation of the GBLUP method is equivalent to assuming a normal distribution of SNP effects with constant variance across SNPs []. The Bayes C (BayesC) method consisted of fitting a mixture model for SNP effects using the same model equation as in (1)  in which     µ      and  were defined as before  but the elements of vector  were calculated for each animal as  where z is the genotype of the i marker  coded as the number of copies of the reference allele   is the effect of marker   and  is an indicator variable that is equal to 1 if the i marker has a non-zero effect on the trait and 0 otherwise. Model parameters were estimated within a Bayesian framework. It was assumed that <U+2009> and <U+2009>~<U+2009>N (0   s). Scaled inverse chi-squared distributions  with v degrees of freedom and scale parameter S were assumed for s and s. Unlike the Bayes B method []  this mixture model assumes that SNP marker effects are sampled from a single (normal) distribution  instead of estimating marker-specific variances. An arbitrarily small value of 4 was assumed for v  while the scale parameters were derived according to [].  was defined as described before. A binomial distribution with probability p was assumed for  and an informative beta distribution (a<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.d8  ß<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.d10) was assigned for p (implying that this parameter was kept fixed around 0.01). This method was very similar to that proposed in []  except that p was assumed to be known  as in []. The SNP effects were estimated using the Gibbs sampling algorithm implemented in the GS3 software []. A single chain with a length of 100 000 iterations was used. The burn-in period was 20 000 iterations and the thinning interval was 100 iterations. The model for Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO) was similar to the one in equation ()  except for the assumption about SNP marker effects. This implementation can be understood as a linear mixed model assuming an exponential prior distribution for variances of marker effects. Originally  the LASSO procedure [] was a statistical method that combined both variable selection and shrinkage. Legarra et al. [] proposed an alternative Bayesian implementation of this method  which we used here. Based on the parameterization proposed by these authors  the prior for individual SNP effects () can be represented by: This parameterization implies that individual variances for each SNP (i.e. t) are estimated  conditional on a regularization parameter  which was estimated by using a prior gamma distribution bounded between 0 and 10. Flat priors were assumed for s and s and differences in reliabilities of dEBV were accounted for via the matrix   as for the other methods. A single chain with a length of 100 000 iterations was generated using GS3 software. The burn-in period was 20 000 iterations and the thinning interval was 100 iterations. The programs used to compute genomic predictions handle missing markers internally. In GS3  missing calls for a given marker are set to the population mean for the respective marker  while in the gebv software missing genotypes are inferred using a pedigree-based algorithm. Due to the low frequency of missing genotypes (0.25%) the effects of different imputation procedures are expected to be negligible  as already reported by []. The four statistical methods used to derive DGV were evaluated based on comparison of DGV with dEBV of animals from the testing set using the following statistics: Pearson’s correlation between DGV and dEBV  divided by the average accuracy of dEBV  was computed as the empirical accuracy of prediction (r). This quantity can be used as a proxy for the correlation of the DGV with the true breeding value []  which is why it is abbreviated as “r”. The average accuracy of dEBV was computed as the average of the dEBV accuracies calculated according to []. the slope of the regression of dEBV on DGV for animals in the testing set (b1) was evaluated to measure the degree of inflation/deflation of genomic predictions  i.e. the scale of the DGV compared to that of dEBV. Estimates of b1 close to 1 are indicative of predictions that are on scale similar to that of the dEBV. the mean squared error of prediction (MSE) between DGV and dEBV of animals in the testing set was used as a measure of the overall fit of each model to the data. Larger estimates of r are indicative of more reliable predictions and a lower MSE is associated with a better overall fit  including scale. In addition to the forward prediction scheme (FORW)  two alternative validation strategies were tested for GBLUP20 in order to investigate the impact of the genetic relationship between training and testing sets on the accuracy of genomic predictions in this population. These strategies were based on 5-fold cross-validation that either separated animals in five groups of similar size at random (RAND) or based on minimizing genetic relationships between groups (DIST). For DIST  a k-means algorithm [] was applied  with the distance matrix built based on the genomic relationships among genotyped animals  similar to []. In the case of RAND and DIST  the dEBV generated from the 2011 genetic evaluations were used for both the training and testing steps and the average r (calculated using the five folds) was used as a proxy for the empirical accuracy of the DGV. In order to investigate the extent to which individual accuracies of the DGV of animals in the testing set were influenced by their relatedness with individuals from the training set  under the forward prediction design  different measures of its genomic relatedness with animals in the training set were calculated for each animal in the testing set  based on the genomic relationship matrix (G) used in GBLUP  similar to []. The maximum relationship (maxr) and the average of the top 5 (ave5)  10 (ave10)  20 (ave20) and 50 (ave50) relationships between each testing animal and all animals in the training set were calculated. Since GBLUP allowed the calculation of individual DGV accuracies based on elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix (hereafter  estimated accuracies  or rPEV)  the correlations of rPEV with the different measures of relatedness with the training set were determined. Finally  the empirical accuracies and estimated accuracies (averaged across animals in the testing set) were compared with the analytical expectation for accuracy of genomic predictions  calculated according to a formula proposed by [] (i.e. Equation  in that study). This formula predicts the expected accuracy for an animal without phenotypic information and without close relatives in the training set  as a function of the number of animals in the training set  the heritability of pseudo-phenotypes and effective number of chromosome segments (Me)  which was approximated using estimates of genome size (L) and effective population size (Ne)  i.e. Me<U+2009>=<U+2009>2NeL/ln(4NeL). For such calculations  a 30 Morgan genome was assumed  the average reliability of the animals in the training set were considered as the heritability of pseudo-phenotypes  and markers were assumed to capture 80% of the genetic variance for all traits. A value of 120 was adopted for Ne  similar to the estimate obtained by [] for the population used in this study. After quality control of the genotyping data (QC)  the average (SD) minor allele frequency was 0.226 (0.144) and the average (median) linkage disequilibrium (r) between pairs of adjacent markers was 0.293 (0.164). Empirical accuracies of genomic predictions (r) ranged from 0.17 (navel at weaning) to 0.74 (carcass finishing precocity at yearling). The average empirical accuracy across traits was 0.39 and 0.40 for GBLUP0 and GBLUP20  respectively  and 0.44 for both BayesC and BLASSO (Table ). For traits measured in both periods  empirical accuracies were from 18% to 61% higher at yearling than at weaning. For most traits  GBLUP20 resulted in slightly greater accuracies than GBLUP0  although this advantage was greater (12%) for gestation length  while for conformation at weaning  GBLUP0 was 13% more accurate than GBLUP20 (Table ). In general  empirical accuracies of BayesC were very similar to those of BLASSO and superior to those achieved with both implementations of GBLUP. The largest advantage of Bayesian regression methods over GBLUP20 in terms of empirical accuracy was obtained for gestation length (+48%)  weight gain from birth to weaning (+35%)  conformation at weaning (+25%) and birth weight (+25%). Conversely  GBLUP20 was more accurate than Bayesian regressions for weight gain from weaning to yearling (+9.5%) and for conformation at yearling (+4.5%) (Table ). The slope of the regression of dEBV on DGV (b1) was expected to be close to 1  which would indicate that genomic predictions are on a similar scale as the deregressed EBV  i.e. not inflated or deflated. In general  both GBLUP0 and GBLUP20 outperformed the Bayesian regression methods in terms of scale  i.e.  for most traits  predictions of DGV obtained with both BayesC and BLASSO were deflated (Table ). Predictions from GBLUP20 tended to be slightly deflated  while those from GBLUP0 tended to be slightly inflated (Table ). When averaged across traits  the slope of the regression of dEBV on DGV was equal to 0.96  1.05  1.39 and 1.35 for GBLUP0  GBLUP20  BayesC and BLASSO  respectively. However  for birth weight and navel at weaning  BayesC and BLASSO clearly outperformed GBLUP in terms of scale. For most traits  the overall fit of the model to the data  judged by the mean squared prediction error (MSE)  favored both GBLUP methods over the Bayesian regression methods (Table ). However  for three of the traits (scrotal circumference  birth weight and gestation length)  lower estimates of MSE were obtained for Bayes C and Bayesian LASSO (Table ). For most traits  the average accuracy of the DGV (rPEV) was around 0.46  ranging from 0.22 to 0.61 (Table ). Correlations between accuracies estimated for individuals in the testing set and their relatedness with animals in the training set were strong. The best predictor for this association was the average of the top five relationships between a testing animal and animals in the training set (ave5)  for which the average correlation with rPEV across traits was 0.81. The maximum relationship between a testing animal and animals in the training set (maxr) also exhibited a strong association with rPEV (average correlation of 0.78). Across all animals in the testing set  the average maxr and ave5 was equal to 0.35 and 0.20  respectively (Table ). When compared across traits  the mean (SD) of expected accuracies based on Daetwyler’s formula [] was equal to 0.49 (0.03). In general  although the average empirical accuracies matched their expectations well  values higher than expected were observed for some traits  notably for carcass finishing precocity and muscling evaluated at yearling  as well as for scrotal circumference (Figure ). In contrast  for conformation at weaning and the navel traits  empirical accuracies were at least 50% lower than their expected values.      Colored bars indicate: empirical accuracies calculated as the Pearson’s correlation between deregressed proofs in 2011 for the bulls in the testing set and their DGV  divided by the average accuracy of dEBV in the testing set (empirical accuracies were obtained using four methods of prediction: GBLUP20  GBLUP0  Bayes C and Bayesian LASSO); estimated accuracies (rPEV) were calculated by averaging the individual accuracies (obtained based on diagonal elements of the inverse of the coefficient matrix in GBLUP20) across all animals in the testing set; expected accuracies were calculated with the analytical formula proposed by Daetwyler et al. []; *WG<U+2009>=<U+2009>weight gain from birth to weaning (about 205 days of age); Cw  Pw  Mw  Nw<U+2009>=<U+2009>visual scores taken at weaning for carcass conformation  finishing precocity  muscling and navel  respectively; PWG<U+2009>=<U+2009>weight gain from weaning to yearling (about 550 days of age); Cy  Py  My  Ny<U+2009>=<U+2009>visual scores taken at yearling for carcass conformation  finishing precocity  muscling and navel  respectively; SCaw<U+2009>=<U+2009>scrotal circumference adjusted for age and weight; BW<U+2009>=<U+2009>birth weight; GL<U+2009>=<U+2009>gestation length; WI<U+2009>=<U+2009>weaning index  composed of traits evaluated at weaning; FI<U+2009>=<U+2009>final index  composed of traits evaluated at weaning and yearling (FI) [See Additional file  for more details]. Across traits  empirical accuracies were on average 41% smaller for DIST than for the RAND strategy (Figure ). The extent of relatedness between testing and training animals was evaluated using statistics similar to maxr and ave5 (described previously). For this  both maxr and ave5 were averaged across the testing animals of each fold and a pooled average was calculated based on the averages of the five folds.        *forward<U+2009>=<U+2009>training set composed of bulls with highly accurate EBV in 2007 and testing set composed of the remaining bulls (with accurate EBV in 2011); RAND<U+2009>=<U+2009>5-fold cross-validation (CV)  splitting animals randomly into groups of similar size; DIST<U+2009>=<U+2009>5-fold cross-validation  based on k-means clustering of animals based on their genomic distance (i.e. minimizing inter-groups relationships); empirical accuracies were calculated as the Pearson’s correlation between DGV (obtained with GBLUP20) and deregressed EBV (dEBV) in 2011 for the testing set  divided by the average accuracy of dEBV in the testing set; for the cross-validation strategies (RAND and DIST)  the bars and errors bars represent the estimates of means and standard errors obtained in 5-fold CV  respectively; **WG<U+2009>=<U+2009>weight gain from birth to weaning (about 205 days of age); Cw  Pw  Mw  Nw<U+2009>=<U+2009>visual scores taken at weaning for carcass conformation  finishing precocity  muscling and navel  respectively; PWG<U+2009>=<U+2009>weight gain from weaning to yearling (about 550 days of age); Cy  Py  My  Ny<U+2009>=<U+2009>visual scores taken at yearling for carcass conformation  finishing precocity  muscling and navel  respectively; SCaw<U+2009>=<U+2009>scrotal circumference adjusted for age and weight; BW<U+2009>=<U+2009>birth weight; GL<U+2009>=<U+2009>gestation length; WI<U+2009>=<U+2009>weaning index  composed of traits evaluated at weaning; FI<U+2009>=<U+2009>final index  composed by traits evaluated at weaning and yearling (FI) [See Additional file  for more details]. The pooled averages of maxr and ave5 were 0.37 and 0.24  respectively  under the RAND strategy and were thus slightly greater than those found for the forward prediction strategy. For DIST  pooled averages of maxr and ave5 were about 2-fold lower (0.20 and 0.12  respectively) than for RAND and the forward prediction strategy. The empirical accuracies obtained for RAND and DIST cannot be compared directly with those of the forward prediction scheme  since dEBV from the same genetic evaluation (dEBV) were used for both training and testing animals for RAND and DIST  which is expected to bias the predictive abilities upwards. Considering all traits  the average proportion of animals in the training set was about 83% for both RAND and DIST  although there was greater variation in fold sizes for DIST. The average size of the training set was slightly smaller for the forward prediction scheme  which could also contribute to slightly smaller empirical accuracies in this strategy. The pattern of linkage disequilibrium decay in indicine populations differs from that observed in taurine populations [] and beef cattle have a lower level of LD at the same distance than dairy cattle []. The average LD between adjacent markers obtained with the Bovine HD panel in Nellore cattle was similar to the values obtained in Holstein populations with 50 k chips [  ]. This level of LD is sufficient to achieve accurate genomic predictions in  (Nellore) cattle []  provided enough phenotypic information is used to estimate marker effects. Based on the empirical accuracies of prediction  BayesC and BLASSO outperformed the two alternative implementations of GBLUP  with few exceptions. For most traits  GBLUP predictions had smaller MSE and a scale more compatible with that of the deregressed EBV used for validation  when compared to the Bayesian regression methods. Simulation studies have suggested the superiority of methods based on some sort of variable selection over GBLUP [  –]. This advantage has not been confirmed in many previous studies that compared different methods using real data. In studies using real data  GBLUP performed comparably or better than variable selection methods [      ]  although there is evidence that substantially higher accuracies can be achieved using variable selection methods for traits that are known to be affected by genes of moderate-to-large effects (e.g. traits affected by   [  ]). The benefit of using variable selection methods is expected to be higher when the number of markers is much greater than the number of genotyped animals. Neither of the previous GS studies on real data contained such large differences between number of animals in the training set and number of genotyped SNPs  thus our study included a scenario for which the use of variable selection methods was expected to provide some benefit. Erbe et al. [] also confirmed the advantage of a variable selection method (Bayes R) over GBLUP  after analyzing GS in dairy cattle using the same type of high-density panel as we used. These authors suggested that variable selection methods must be used to take full advantage of the increased marker density. The larger empirical accuracies that we obtained with BayesC and BLASSO here corroborate this hypothesis. Moreover  the considerably greater empirical accuracies that we obtained with BayesC and BLASSO for some of the traits may also suggest the segregation of genes of larger effect for these traits. For instance  a recent GWAS (genome-wide association study) for birth weight  that used data from this same  population  provided evidence that a region on chromosome 14 had an important effect on this trait []; this region had previously been shown to be associated to body size in taurine cattle []. The simulation study in [] provided evidence that the relative advantage of variable selection methods over GBLUP depends on the number of QTL (Nqtl) underlying the trait. When Nqtl is greater than the effective number of chromosome segments  GBLUP should perform equally or better than variable selection methods. In the present study  weight gain from weaning to yearling was the only trait for which a clear advantage in terms of empirical accuracy was observed for GBLUP. Obtaining individual accuracies and reduced computation time are potential advantages of GBLUP over Bayesian regression methods. The computation time necessary to process all 15 traits took less than one minute with GBLUP  while about two days were required for each of the two Bayesian regression methods (data not shown). The reason for such large differences in computing time is partially due to the fact that the number of genotyped animals is much smaller than the number of markers  and these differences are expected to decline as the number of genotyped animals increases. For most traits  slightly greater empirical accuracy was achieved with GBLUP20 than with GBLUP0  which confirms the results reported by []. However  conversely to what these authors indicated  the use of GBLUP20 showed no clear evidence of improvement in the scale of the DGV. This  and the fact that GBLUP0 was slightly more accurate than GBLUP20 for some traits  suggests that the optimal weight (w) for pedigree-based relationships in this alternative implementation of GBLUP may be trait-specific  as pointed out by []. In the present study  both empirical and estimated accuracies of genomic predictions matched their expectations relatively well but some noteworthy deviances were found. The relatively small number of animals analyzed (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>685) restricted the formation of training and testing sets to small numbers of individuals  which led to some degree of variation due to sampling  especially when correlations were calculated. Lower than expected empirical accuracies were estimated for some traits  notably for conformation at weaning and navel. This could be explained by inadequacy of the model used for SNP effect estimation  for instance if the marker density was not sufficiently high to track all genetic variation associated with these traits. In addition  for all traits  expected accuracies were based on the assumption that markers explain 80% of the genetic variance  and the adequacy of this assumption may be trait-specific. Another potential source of noise is related to the fact that the response variables used in model training are prone to prediction errors  the extent of which can also vary across traits. Further analyses suggested that empirical accuracies greater than expected could be caused by population stratification. As already reported by [] for this same population  two breeding subgroups were observed in a principal component analysis based on genomic relationships [see Additional file ]. Other investigations have also shown higher-than-expected accuracies for traits for which EBV means differed significantly between these subgroups (data not shown). The existence of these subgroups is consistent with two different artificial selection criteria that were applied in this population in the past 20 years []. The major differences between such selection criteria consist of largely different emphases on the traits for which we observed higher-than-expected accuracies in the present study (i.e. carcass finishing precocity at yearling  muscling at yearling and scrotal circumference). The results of this study seemed to confirm the association reported by [] between the accuracy of individual DGV and the relatedness of testing and training animals  although the strength of this association was lower in the present study. The authors of [] found that the average of the top 10 relationships with training animals (ave10) was a better predictor of estimated accuracies than the maximum relationship  while the opposite was observed in this study. For some traits  the average of the estimated individual accuracies was consistent with the empirical accuracies  while this did not hold for other traits. Clark et al. [] also showed that  while estimated and empirical accuracies agreed well for simulated data and for eye muscle depth in Merino sheep  larger differences between these two sets of accuracies were found for live weight in the same population. Reasonable evidence for an association between the relationship of the animals in the testing set and the training set and the accuracies of DGV was found  which confirmed the report by []. The cross-validation strategies applied in the present study (RAND and DIST) indicated that the same association also holds for empirical accuracies. In this context  when comparing RAND and DIST  we observed that empirical accuracies nearly halved with a 2-fold decrease in average relatedness between testing and training set animals. A consequence of this observation is the possibility of evaluating to which extent the relationship between selection candidates and training animals would affect the accuracy of genomic predictions. Based on the estimates of relationships calculated according to top5 and maxr under the forward prediction scheme  it is expected that the accuracy of DGV prediction will not differ much from values reported here  given that the sire or a few half-sibs are included in the training set for most selection candidates in this population. Thus  application of GS in this population requires a dynamic training set  because recurrent inclusion of new sires in the training population is necessary to enhance predictions of the genetic merit of young animals []. Although our study mainly focused on the accuracies of genomic predictions  depending on the selection scheme  the scale of predictions should be a matter of concern  especially to determine whether DGV can be compared to traditional EBV from routine evaluations. For example  in situations in which both progeny-tested and newborn animals are selection candidates  an artificial overestimation of the genetic trend would lead to undue exaggeration of DGV over traditional EBV  as discussed by []. Although Bayes C and BLASSO were more accurate than GBLUP for most traits in the present study  these Bayesian regression methods tended to generate deflated predictions. Previous studies have found large differences in the scale of genomic predictions obtained using Bayesian regression. Some of these studies do not agree with the trend of deflation we observed here (e.g. [  ])  while other methods similar to BayesC and BLASSO also resulted in deflated predictions for some traits analyzed [    ]. This variation in scale may be related to differences inherent to the data analyzed (e.g. the extent to which training animals were pre-selected) and to differences in the implementation of the methods. Future studies should investigate whether including a residual polygenic effect in these Bayesian regression models could improve the scale of genomic predictions  as suggested by []. Because the selection candidates in this population have own performance data recorded before selection decisions take place  the accuracy of traditional EBV based on own performance could be a suitable reference to evaluate the gain in accuracy that can be attributed to GS. Unfortunately  this information was only available for a small subset of the testing animals in our study  due to the fact that a considerable proportion of the animals were born and had own performance data recorded within other breeding programs  although they had enough progeny recorded in the dataset available for this study to obtain accurate EBV in 2011. A proper comparison between empirical accuracies of traditional EBV and DGV should be carried out as soon as more information is available. In addition  DGV accuracies are expected to increase when more animals are genotyped. Another topic that deserves further investigation is the identification of an optimal marker density for genomic prediction in the population analyzed. Theoretically  a higher marker density is expected to increase the accuracy of genomic predictions  due to stronger LD between markers and QTL []. Previous studies that compared genomic predictions obtained with high-density (~777 000 markers  HD) and medium-density panels (~54 000 markers  54 k) in  breeds reported only a marginal increase in accuracies when using high-density panels [  ]. Because the size of the reference population in this study is small  the possible benefits of an increased marker density could be counterbalanced by an increase in the number of unknown parameters to be estimated  as previously suggested by []. For instance  in a Jersey population  when genomic predictions were obtained with a training set of size comparable to that of the present study  the accuracy of the DGV decreased slightly when moving from 54 k to HD []. The relative benefit of genomic predictions obtained at different marker densities will be evaluated when more information is available. While these initial results seem to confirm the technical feasibility of applying genomic selection in a  (Nellore) beef cattle population  further work is needed on the design of breeding schemes for this particular breed. In this context  imputation methods will probably play an important role to improve cost-effectiveness of this technology  as suggested by []. The technical feasibility of applying genomic prediction in a  (Nellore) population was demonstrated  although further research on its implementation in breeding schemes is necessary to enable more cost-effective selection decisions using genomic information. Bayesian regression models (Bayes C and BLASSO) were more accurate than GBLUP for most traits and are of interest for future applications of genomic selection in this population  but further improvements are needed to reduce deflation of the predictions obtained with such methods. The accuracies of genomic predictions depended on the extent of relatedness between training and testing set animals  which means that recurrent updates of the training population are necessary to enhance predictions of the genetic merit of young animals.

Both the reaction norm and the factor analytic models can help identify the environmental variables responsible for GxE interaction. A factor analytic model is preferred over a reaction norm model when limited information on differences in environmental variables between farms is available. Body weight at harvest is an economically important trait in rainbow trout () and other farmed fish species. Rainbow trout can be produced in a wide range of farming environments. When genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE) is present and when selection is practiced only in a breeding environment  lower-than-expected genetic gains can be obtained in other production environments. Optimization of a breeding program to account for GxE interaction can increase genetic gain across environments [–]. Optimization may be expensive  for instance when environment-specific breeding programs need to be established. Alternatively  if environmental variables (EV) are changed so that they are similar across production environments  GxE interaction may decrease. This requires that the EV that cause GxE interaction are identified  which can be done by using a reaction norm model to quantify GxE interaction as the function of specific EV [–]. Alternatively  in a two-step factor analysis  a latent common factor responsible for GxE interaction is first identified and  subsequently  correlations between the common factor and EV are calculated to identify the significant EV []. In this study  our aim was to identify the EV that cause a strong GxE interaction for body weight at harvest in rainbow trout using a reaction norm model and a factor analytic model. The data used in this study were from a GxE experiment conducted in four different environments on three continents (North America  South America  and Europe as described by Sae-Lim et al. []). In August 2009  100 full-sib families were produced from 58 sires and 100 dams (1 to 1.7 mating ratio) at the Troutlodge breeding company in Washington State (nucleus: NUC). Procedures for the ethical treatment of animals at Troutlodge  Inc. followed the US and/or State guidelines for animal care and use including those outlined by “Guidelines for Use of Fishes in Field Research” established by the American Fisheries Society (AFS)  the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (ASIH)  and the American Institute of Fisheries Research Biologists (AIFRB). The same standard was applied for all animals in the study. Fertilization took place during a period of four weeks. Different water temperatures were used to synchronize embryonic development and hatching. At least 25 eyed eggs per family were shipped to each of the following three locations: (1) the re-circulating aquaculture system at the Freshwater Institute  Virginia  USA (FI); (2) a high altitude farm with low oxygen dissolved in water (Titicaca Lake) in Peru (PE); and (3) a low water temperature farm in Germany (GE). A random sample of 25 eyed eggs per family was maintained at NUC as a control. All fish were measured for body weight at harvest (BWH  in grams)  in June 2010 (NUC)  in July 2010 (FI)  in August 2010 (PE)  and in December 2010 (GE) (Table ). The fish were tagged using passive integrated transponders (PIT tag; Allflex USA  Inc. for NUC  FI and PE  and DORSET Identification b.v.  the Netherlands  for GE) and the PIT tag was scanned (scanner SF2001ISO: Destron Fearing  USA for NUC  FI and PE  and GR250: DORSET Identification b.v.  the Netherlands  for GE) at an average size of 26.3 to 33.2 g (five to seven months of age). Before tagging  fish were anesthetized with MS222 (150 mg/L) in the NUC  FI  and PE farms and with clove oil (10 mg/L) in the GE farm. Fin clips were collected from all 158 parents and from the fish at tagging from FI  PE and GE for DNA extraction. In the NUC farm  fin clips were not collected  because fish were kept in separate full-sib family tanks until tagging  allowing the pedigree to be recorded. DNA was isolated from fin clips to reconstruct pedigrees. Genotyping was done at three laboratories: National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture  USDA; Troutlodge  Inc.; and Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre  Wageningen University. The protocols for DNA isolation and genotyping were synchronized across the three laboratories. DNA isolation was done using the Nucleospin® 96 Tissue Core Kit. Multiplex PCR amplification was as described in []. Nine microsatellite markers were used for PCR: OMM1008  OMM1051  OMM1088  OMM1097 []  OMM5007  OMM5047 []  OMM5233  OMM5177 []  and OMM1325 []. Multiplex PCR amplifications  i.e. quadroplex and pentaplex  were as follows []: an initial 5 min denaturation at 95°C  followed by 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95°C  45 s annealing at 55°C  and 90 s extension at 72°C  and a final 10 min extension step at 72°C. Fragment analysis of the PCR products was done by setting the fragment sizes to Genescan LIZ 500 size standard (Applied Biosystem). Output data were analysed using Genemapper software version 4 (Applied Biosystem) []. Parental allocation was performed using PAPA software [] based on the known mating data to increase the accuracy of parental assignments []. In total  2142 out of 2243 fish sampled in FI  3106 out of 3236 fish sampled in PE  and 2104 out of 2235 fish sampled in GE were successfully allocated to the 100 full-sib families. The 362 fish that were not successfully allocated to a family were removed from the dataset. In total  six generations of pedigree information  one from the DNA reconstructed pedigree and five from the previous generations of pedigree information  were used in the genetic analyses. Summary statistics of the EV are in Table . The average water temperature (°C) was measured in the tank (NUC  FI)  raceway (GE) or lake (PE) during the rearing period of the experiment. In NUC  the average ambient temperature was between 13 and 14°C throughout the growing season. In FI  PE  and GE  the water temperature followed the natural (daily and seasonal) fluctuations. Water temperature was recorded every 15 min using a data logging Transmitter SC100 (Hach Lange  Germany) in NUC and GE. In FI  temperature was measured once a day using either a Hach HQ40d hand held meter or a SC100 Universal Controller (Hach Company  Loveland  CO). In PE  temperatures were measured with a standard mercury thermometer in the Titicaca Lake once a day for only a short period (September 3 to 16  2010). However  water temperature of the Titicaca Lake does not fluctuate much throughout the year and varies between 12 and 14°C. Average age at harvest (in days) corresponded to the period between hatching and day of harvest. Differences in age at harvest were caused by differences in preferred market sizes across environments. In NUC  harvest was done twice (at 2 week intervals). In salmonids  the growth rate depends on the water temperature. The product of days to harvest and daily temperature is therefore commonly used in salmonid farming to compare days to harvest across temperature regimes. Day*Degree was calculated as: average water temperature during the growing period multiplied by average age at harvest. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the water during the rearing period  recorded in mg/L or ppm  was calculated based on the average of daily measurements. In NUC  oxygen was measured daily in the morning (between 7:30 and 9:00 am) using a YSI model 550 (YSI  Yellow Springs  OH) at the inlet and outlet of the rearing tanks. In FI  oxygen was measured at a single position in the circular tanks once a day between 8:00 and 9:30 am  using a Hach HQ40d with a Hach LDO probe attachment  or a SC100 Universal Controller (Hach Company  Loveland  CO). In PE  dissolved oxygen was measured in the net pens of Titicaca Lake in the morning (between 9:00 and 10:00 am) for a short period of time (same as temperature)  using the Hach dissolved oxygen test kit (Hach Company  Loveland  CO). In GE  dissolved oxygen level was controlled to be above 10 mg/L. When the dissolved oxygen decreased  supplementary oxygen was automatically released until the dissolved oxygen was above 10 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen was measured every 15 min using a data logging Transmitter SC100 (Hach Lange  Germany). Since the experiment was conducted across continents  changes in day length differed. “Photoperiod” was defined as the difference between the maximum day length observed during the rearing period and average day length during the rearing period. This measurement reflects the amplitude of day length  which provides more information than average day length. The locations that were used to calculate photoperiod were: Seattle in Washington State (NUC)  Martinsburg in West Virginia (FI)  Juliaca in Peru (PE)  and Leipzig Schkeuditz in Germany (GE). Data on times of sunrise and sunset each week in 2009 and 2010 were obtained from . Average day length was calculated as the difference between sunrise and sunset in minutes  for each day of the week in the rearing period (Figure ). To account for differences between northern and southern hemispheres (NUC  FI and GE versus PE)  we used negative and positive signs to indicate the directions of change in the photoperiod.  The x-axis represents the rearing period in two-month intervals (month-year); each observation represents the average day length during a two-week interval; the rearing period differed across environments: NUC = breeding environment  FI = Freshwater Institute  PE = Peru and GE = Germany. In a previous study  we reported a significant GxE interaction for body weight at harvest in rainbow trout that were reared on three different continents []. Genetic correlations (0.19 to 0.48) were estimated using a multivariate model (multi-trait multi-environment) with correction for selection bias due to selective mortality. The same data were used to identify the EV that contributed to the GxE interaction in this study. ASReml was used for all models in this study. In this study  we compared reaction norm and factor analytic models with the multivariate model without selection bias correction. The multivariate model without the selection bias correction was: where  is the observation (body weight at harvest) of the  individual in a given environment ( =1: NUC  2: FI  3: PE  and 4: GE)   is the overall mean.  is the coefficient of linear fixed regression on age at harvest () within the  environment. The () was included in the model to correct for different measurement dates  and corrected for the length of the rearing period from hatching to the day of trait measurement. The orthogonal polynomial of () was tested for significance up to the third order but the quadratic and the cubic orders were not significant based on a Wald test.  is the effect of the  fertilization period within the  environment due to different groups of available fertile dams.  is the random additive genetic effect    MVN[    ]  of the  animal  where MVN is the multivariate normal distribution   is the additive genetic relationship matrix among individuals and  is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix among body weight in the different environments. Residual covariances of the same trait measured in different environments were set to zero  because animals were measured in only one environment: where  is residual variance of body weight in different  environments. The EV causing GxE interaction can be identified by fitting each EV in a reaction norm model. Random regression was used to estimate (co)variance components. The random animal effect was modelled as a function of the EV. The random regression model was: where  is fixed environmental effect ( =1: NUC  2: FI  3: PE  and 4: GE)  accounting for different levels of environment and  is random regression coefficient  for animal  for the orthogonal polynomial  for an EV in environment  with  maximum order of the polynomial. The matrix of random regression coefficients was assumed to be distributed multivariate normal:   where MVN is the multivariate normal distribution   is the additive genetic relationship matrix  and  is the * genetic (co)variance matrix for parameters of the reaction norm model. The  is the highest order of polynomial () + 1. Residual effects  for animal  in environment  were assumed distributed   where  is the identity matrix. A third order polynomial for the random reaction norm model results in a 4×4  matrix  which is the same dimension as the original multivariate model with four environments. When each environment has just one value for the environmental variable  the multivariate model and the reaction norm model yield identical genetic correlations []. Therefore  even meaningless EV would give the same results as the multivariate model. Thus  to identify EV responsible for the GxE interaction  we decided to use a first order polynomial ( = 1)  because it is the simplest and has the largest difference in number of estimated parameters. The additive genetic variance  of BWH for each level of an EV was calculated as  where  is a  1 vector of polynomial coefficients for each level of the EV and  is the transposed vector of . The covariance (COV) between BWH at levels  and  of an EV was calculated as . The genetic correlation () between BWH at levels  and  of an EV was calculated as . Standard errors of estimates of genetic correlations were approximated with ASReml []. The sire BLUP-estimated breeding value (EBV) for each level of EV was calculated as   where  is a 1* vector of sire BLUP-EBV for BWH The sire BLUP-EBV of eight randomly selected sires were plotted against photoperiod as an example to show the degree of heterogeneity of additive genetic variance and re-ranking of sires  depending on change across levels of photoperiod. The factor analytic (FA) model identifies latent common factors that explain the variation in the data and can be used to estimate GxE interaction []. The FA animal mixed model was: where  is the random genetic effect of the latent common factor across environments for animal  and  is the random genetic effect specific to environment  for animal . The five genetic effects (one across environments and four specific to each environment) were assumed distributed multivariate normal:   where  is the additive genetic relationship matrix and  is the genetic (co)variance matrix for common and specific animal effects. The common animal effect can be interpreted as the breeding value for the latent common factor whereas the specific animal effects are the environment-specific remnant breeding value unexplained by the common factor. Therefore  each animal has five breeding values. The genetic (co)variance matrix  =  ' +   where  is the matrix of factor loadings (coefficient vector of the latent common factor) and  is the diagonal matrix of specific variances () for each environment   accounting for additional variance  i.e.  variation that is not explained by latent common factors [] The total number of parameters fitted in the FA model is ( + 1)-(-1)/2 and may not exceed ( + 1)/2  where  is the size of  matrix from the multivariate model  and  is the number of latent common factors. When  is equal to 1  the number of parameters fitted in FA is 4(1 + 1) -1(1-1)/2 = 8  compared to 4(4 + 1)/2 = 10 for the multivariate model []. The eight parameters are four elements of estimated loading  and four estimated specific variance  for each environment . The number of factors cannot be higher than 1 in this study. In ASReml  different types of FA models can be implemented []. In this study  we used the extended FA (XFA) [  ] model  which provides estimates of the  matrix  of loading parameters  of correlations between genetic effects in four environments  and of the latent common factor. The additive genetic variance  for a certain environment was estimated as: . The square of the loading parameter indicates the amount of additive genetic effect explained by the latent common factor. A high loading for an environment indicates that the latent common factor explains a large amount of the additive genetic variance in that environment. The percentage of additive genetic variance explained by latent common factors in a specific environment was calculated as: . The covariance of BWH between environments  and  was calculated as . The  between BWH measured in different environments  and  was estimated as: . Initially  the environmental effect common to full-sibs (caused by family rearing until tagging) was included in the model. However  ASReml had difficulty in disentangling genetic (co)variance components from common environmental (co)variance components. The solution was not positive definite and therefore we decided to exclude the common environmental effect from this and all other models in this study. Reaction norm and FA models were compared using Akaike’s information criteria (AIC: []) and Bayesian’s information criteria (BIC: []). The model with the lowest AIC and BIC indicates the most parsimonious model. All models were kept the same with respect to fixed effects so that they were comparable in terms of REML log likelihood. With a reaction norm model  the EV that provide the best fit to the data will result in the highest log likelihood of the model. In addition  the mean square deviation (MSD) was calculated as the difference between estimated genetic correlations obtained from reaction norm and multivariate (MUV) models and was computed as   where  and  are the estimated genetic correlations of BWH between different environments obtained from the reaction norm and multivariate models  respectively. The  genetic correlation was from the same pair of environments for both models and  was equal to six  because with four environments there are six genetic correlations. The reaction norm model with the lowest MSD is the model that deviates least from the multivariate model  which indicates that the EV used in that reaction norm model is able to capture the GxE interaction. The FA model was used as the first step in a two-step approach. The second step consisted of estimating correlations between loadings and means of EV. Pearson () and Kendall rank () correlations between loading of the latent common factor and EV were calculated to identify the EV that shows the highest correlation with the latent common factor  which is the most likely EV that caused the GxE interaction. For the reaction norm model  estimates of  of BWH between different environments are in Table . For age at harvest  estimates of  varied between 0.57 and 0.99 (MSD = 0.17). For water temperature  estimates of  varied between 0.61 and 0.99 (MSD = 0.19). Estimates of  for Day*Degree were lower and varied between 0.35 and 0.97 (MSD = 0.09). For dissolved oxygen  estimates of  ranged from 0.60 to 0.99 (MSD = 0.14)  which was similar to the range of estimates of  for water temperature. For photoperiod  estimates of  ranged from 0.37 to 0.97 (MSD = 0.12). Reaction norm models with day-degree and photoperiod as EV resulted in genetic correlations closest to the multivariate model  which indicates that day-degree and photoperiod were the most important EV that explain the GxE interaction. A plot of the EBV of eight randomly selected sires against photoperiod shows that the GxE interaction was caused by both heterogeneity of additive genetic variance and re-ranking (Figure ).  Only eight randomly chosen sires are plotted in this graph to illustrate the degree of re-ranking. For the FA model  estimates of  of BWH between PE and NUC (0.36)  between PE and FI (0.41)  and between PE and GE (0.39) were low  which indicate moderate to strong re-ranking. The estimate of  of BWH between NUC and FI was much lower (0.56) than the estimate obtained through the reaction norm model when the EV was photoperiod (0.97) or Day*Degree (0.97). For photoperiod  the covariance between NUC and FI obtained through the reaction norm model was similar to that obtained through the FA model (1524.3 and 1555.8  respectively)  which indicates that the higher estimate of  obtained with the reaction norm model (photoperiod) was mainly caused by a lower  (NUC: 1574 and FI: 1570)  as shown in Table . In contrast  for Day*Degree as the EV  the reaction norm model gave a high estimate of  due to both a higher covariance between NUC and FI (1931.7) and a lower  (NUC: 1774 and FI: 2221) compared to those obtained through the FA model. Elements of the estimated loading vector  were equal to 40.34 for NUC  38.57 for FI  30.41 for PE  and 30.70 for GE  which means that the latent common factor explained most of the of  in NUC and FI (Table ). The proportion of genetic variance explained by the common factor was only 26.20% for PE and  was high in PE (2606.73)  which showed that much of the additive genetic variance was not accounted for by the latent common factor. Pearson correlations () between the latent common factor and the known EV were negative and high for Day*Degree (-0.91)  and for age at harvest (-0.86). The Kendall rank correlation () was in agreement with the () but lower for both Day*Degree ( = - 0.67) and age at harvest ( = - 0.67) (Table ). Water temperature was moderately correlated with the latent common factor ( = 0.50). Dissolved oxygen was weakly correlated ( = - 0.14) or not correlated ( = 0.00) with the latent common factor. Photoperiod was positively correlated with the latent common factor ( = 0.32   = 0.33). These results indicate that Day*Degree was the most likely EV responsible for the GxE interaction in BWH. With the reaction norm model  the lowest AIC (87645.7) and BIC (87695.3) were obtained for photoperiod  which indicated that it was the best fitted EV  compared to the other EV (Table ). However  Day*Degree (AIC = 87656.5  BIC = 87706.2) fitted the model similarly well. The best fit was concordant with a lower average estimate of  for either photoperiod or Day*Degree. The AIC (87513.0) and BIC (87528.6) were lower with the FA model than with the reaction norm model  which indicates that the FA model is more parsimonious than the reaction norm model. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental variables (EV) that explain the GxE interaction for body weight at harvest (BWH) of rainbow trout using a reaction norm model and a factor analytic model. To our knowledge  this is the first study that implemented reaction norm and factor analytic models to identify significant EV responsible for GxE interaction in aquaculture. Our findings show that both methods can be used to identify significant EV. However  the reaction norm and FA models identified different significant EV. Based on AIC and BIC  photoperiod gave a slightly better fit with the reaction norm model than Day*Degree  which indicates that photoperiod may also be the most significant EV. However with the FA model  Day*Degree was highly negatively correlated (Pearson correlation:  = - 0.91) with loadings of the latent common factor  which suggests that Day*Degree was the most significant EV. Both the reaction norm and FA models indicate that Day*Degree is an important EV and that it is less likely that temperature is responsible for the GxE interaction. However  the power to identify EV is limited due to having only four environments. Identification of environmental variables that explain GxE interaction has been studied using different methods. In Guernsey cows from four different countries  among the 15 environmental variables that were studied using a random regression model  nine indicated the presence of GxE interaction (estimates of  varied between 0.85 and 0.98) []. By calculating genetic correlations between animals from opposite ends of environmental gradients  Zwald et al. [] reported that seven of 13 EV caused genetic correlations to deviate from unity ( = 0.79 to 0.90). Identification of significant EV that cause GxE interaction is valuable because the information can be used to reduce GxE interaction before optimization of a breeding program. Optimization of a breeding program may be more expensive than changing the significant EV so that they are similar across environments  thereby reducing GxE interaction  because of the possible need to establish multiple sib-testing stations or environment-specific breeding programs. However  changing EV to be similar across environments may be expensive or impossible for some farmers or producers  e.g. in the case of sea water temperature. It may be more reasonable to manipulate EV in the breeding environment (NUC) rather than across all diverging production environments (FI  PE  and GE). However  the decision on which EV to manipulate in the NUC will depend on the relative economic importance of the corresponding production environments for which this EV is relevant. A reduction in genotype re-ranking across environments would lead to an increase of genetic gain of BWH in the production environments but the extra profit that this generates may be offset by the extra costs of EV manipulation. Finding the significant EV is also of biological interest  because it provides evidence for environmental sensitivity of growth in rainbow trout. Artificial selection will target those fish that perform best in the stable and controlled environment in which selection is usually done. This could lead to increased environmental sensitivity across multiple environments [  ]. The elevated sensitivity develops as a logical consequence of re-ranking GxE interaction and/or when genetic variation in the selected environment is higher than in the non-selected environments. Higher sensitivity to environments may have negative consequences  such as reduced fitness and poor animal health in challenging environments []. Alternatively  selection for high growth performance in a challenging environment may lead to more robust and better adapted fish to commercial production environments  thus reducing the detrimental side effects on  or even improving  survival or disease resistance [  ]. Previous studies have shown that photoperiod is one of the major factors that influence growth in rainbow trout [–]. In general  longer day length tends to increase growth rate. Taylor et al. [] found that rainbow trout exposed to a light to dark hours (L:D) rhythm of 18:6 grew significantly faster than rainbow trout exposed to L:D = 8:16  and expressed significantly higher circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) hormone. This hormone is positively correlated with growth rate in rainbow trout []. These observations support the idea that photoperiod may cause the significant GxE interaction for growth if genetic variation in sensitivity to photoperiod exists. The direction of change in day length in Peru is opposite to that in the other locations. The light rhythm can be manipulated in aquaculture production. Manipulation of photoperiod by placing lamps under or above the water is becoming common practice to enhance growth and delay sexual maturation in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout []. Therefore  it may be possible to reduce the GxE interaction due to different photoperiods. Day*Degree is a combination of two factors: days to harvest  which determine the length of the rearing period  and average water temperature. Differences in Day*Degree between environments may result from differences in age or temperature  or both. It is easy to adjust age at harvest so that it is the same across environments  to reduce the observed re-ranking. However  commercial market weights differ between countries  and thus the age differences must be maintained. Most of the production of rainbow trout occurs in fresh and sea water net pens  ponds or raceways  in which temperature control is difficult. In this study  the most significant EV was identified using the following criteria with the reaction norm model: the EV that best fitted the data based on AIC and BIC and the EV that resulted in the lowest mean square deviation (MSD) between estimates of  from the reaction norm and multivariate models. Due to the lack of continuous gradients within environments  the reaction norm model resembled a model with categorical EV. The reaction norm model would pinpoint the EV more efficiently if the EV were measured on a more continuous scale (e.g. more environments or treatments). The factor analytic model is frequently used in plant breeding  for example in multi-environment trials to analyse data on variety testing []. The factor analytic model is the random version of a model with additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) [–]. Recently  it was suggested that the factor analytic model was useful to estimate GxE interaction in animal breeding []. The factor analytic model was used in international sire evaluations to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated  compared to estimating the full genetic variance-covariance matrix between countries []. Our study used a two-step factor analytic model to identify the environmental variable responsible for the GxE interaction. The advantage of using a factor analytic model is the ability to analyse latent common factors  which can be correlated to known EV []  as shown in our study. The latent common factor can be regarded as either a single factor or a composite of environmental factors  because several environmental factors may contribute to the GxE interaction between environments. The latent common factor in this study explained genetic variance in body weight at harvest differently between environments. For instance  the latent common factor explained only 26.2% of the total additive genetic variance for BWH recorded in PE but 63% for BWH recorded in FI. These differences in the percentage of explained additive genetic variance indicates the presence of GxE interaction. In all environments  the percentage of additive genetic variance was less than 100%  which indicates that more than one latent common factor explained the GxE interaction. Due to the limited dimension of the  matrix  the second latent common factor could not be studied  which would require  e.g.  a 5×5 matrix and that the experiment is conducted in at least five farms or locations. The second latent common factor is expected to explain mainly additive genetic variance in PE because common factors are orthogonal and  in the other environments was mainly explained by the first latent common factor. Moreover  with a limited number of environments  the correlation between the latent common factor and the EV may not be accurate and therefore no solid conclusions can be made about EV that explain the GxE interaction. Therefore  it is recommended that a higher number of environments are investigated in future research on GxE interaction. Based on AIC and BIC  the factor analytic model was more parsimonious than the reaction norm model  which indicates that the factor analytic model was the most suitable for our data set. This model is suitable when the experiment does not have multiple farms per environment  and to study latent common factors across environments. With more than five environments  multiple latent common factors can be studied []. As an alternative to the reaction norm or factor analytic models  a hybrid between these two models can be used to capture the GxE interaction and to identify EV. By adding the environment-specific random effect from the FA model to the first order reaction norm model  we can quantify how much of the GxE interaction between environments is explained by the reaction norm on the EV  without the need to compare to the multivariate model. For Day*Degree  the preliminary results from such a hybrid model indicated a better goodness of fit (AIC = 87520.0 and BIC = 87598.0; results not shown) than the original reaction norm model (AIC = 87656.5 and BIC = 87670.2)  as expected. The MSD from the hybrid model was equal to 0.005  which implies that the hybrid model could capture all the GxE interaction present between environments like the multivariate model. This contrasts with the reaction norm model (MSD = 0.09)  which deviated more from the multivariate model. For photoperiod  the hybrid model also had a better goodness of fit (AIC = 87524.2 and BIC = 87539.8; results not shown) than the reaction norm model (AIC = 87635.4 and BIC = 87649.0). Thus  the hybrid model is potentially useful to study GxE interaction and to identify EV. The common environmental effect was excluded from both reaction norm and factor analytic models. In our previous study with the same data  this effect explained a small proportion of the phenotypic variation ( = 0.04) []. In general  the common environmental effect is high in early life stages but decreases over time. In addition  when a common environmental effect was fitted  ASReml could not easily find positive definite solutions and a converged log-likelihood. This is probably due to the difficulty in disentangling genetic (co)variance components from common environmental (co)variance components. Additive genetic variances may be inflated when ignoring common environmental effects [  ] and might result in biased estimates of the genetic correlation. However  the bias in the genetic correlation would depend on biases in the additive genetic covariance and in the additive genetic variances  and might be small if all components are proportionally affected. Practical factorial mating designs and/or multigenerational data may be more efficient in separating genetic and common environmental (co)variance components. This should be taken into account in future studies on GxE interaction. Day*Degree and photoperiod were identified as environmental variables causing a strong GxE interaction for BWH in rainbow trout across four environments. Both the reaction norm and factor analytic models can contribute to the identification of environmental variables responsible for the GxE interaction. A factor analytic model is preferred over a reaction norm model when limited information on the variation of EV between farms is available.

We have derived a genetic-epidemiological function for quantitative genetic analyses of binary infectious disease data  which  unlike current approaches  takes infection dynamics into account and allows for variation in host susceptibility and infectiousness. Infectious diseases constitute the number one threat to livestock production  with potential devastating implications for food security and human health. With the rapid accumulation of data on the genetic regulation of host responses to infectious pathogens  the drive towards strategies that control genetic disease is gaining momentum. Genetic approaches to combat infectious disease tend to focus on improving host resistance  i.e. the ability of a host to block pathogen entry or to counteract pathogen replication within the host. However  despite enormous breakthroughs in genomics  estimating genetic parameters for disease resistance has proven considerably more challenging than analysis of production traits  and this has hampered the incorporation of disease traits into breeding programmes. These challenges partly arise because disease resistance is not a trait that is directly measurable but relies on observable proxies. Due to the requirement of large sample sizes for quantitative genetic analyses  such proxies are often obtained from field data  which are typically binary  indicating whether an individual has become infected or not []. Current quantitative genetic methods analyse binary infectious disease data essentially by contrasting the set of individuals diagnosed as infected to those diagnosed as non-infected  assuming that the observed phenotypic differences represent differences in host resistance to the pathogens under consideration []. However  the corresponding statistical models  such as threshold or logit models  entail several intrinsic assumptions that are unrealistic in the case of infectious disease: First  the observations (e.g. diseased/not diseased) are assumed to be accurate but in reality  the diagnostic tools that are used in the field rarely have complete sensitivity or specificity  i.e. there is a considerable chance for misclassification of individuals as healthy or diseased. Second  it is assumed that exposure to infectious pathogens of individuals that share the same environment is (a) equal between individuals  (b) constant over time and (c) purely environmental. However  in large groups with a non-uniform contact structure  there may be substantial heterogeneity in exposure at any given time. Thus  an individual classed as healthy may have indeed greater resistance  or could simply be misdiagnosed  or may not yet have come in contact with the infectious agents. Furthermore  for infectious diseases transmitted by direct contact  the disease status of an individual is not just the expression of its own resistance in a constant infectious environment. Instead infections result from dynamic interactions between susceptible and infected individuals  and genetic variation may be inherent to all such interactions. As the number of infected individuals in a population changes throughout the time course of a disease outbreak  exposure will change as well. Lastly  exposure depends on how infectious the infected individuals are  which may differ between individuals  e.g. due to different shedding patterns of infectious material or different durations of shedding. Thus  not only host resistance but also host infectiousness  i.e. the ability of a host to transmit an infection  may display substantial host genetic variation. All of the above characteristics that are inherent to natural disease outbreaks are likely to affect estimates of genetic parameters for disease traits. Indeed  we have previously demonstrated that conventional quantitative genetics models fail to capture host genetic variation in infectiousness  if present [  ]. Furthermore  theoretical work has established that imperfect diagnostics and incomplete or variable exposure produce a downward bias in estimates of heritability and of SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) effects  and affect inferences about modes of inheritance of SNP effects for disease resistance [  ]. This theory is empirically supported by comparing results from recent field and challenge experiments that aimed at estimating genetic parameters and at identifying genetic markers for the resistance of pigs to the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) [  ]. Both these studies included approximately 1200 animals  but whereas infection resulted from natural transmission dynamics in the field studies []  the challenge experiment infected all animals with the same dose of a particular PRRSV strain []  thus excluding the various sources of heterogeneity in exposure outlined above. In accordance with theory  heritability estimates for viraemia were considerably lower based on field data than from challenge data (0.096 vs. 0.31) and the challenge study found a major QTL for disease resistance that had not been identified in the field data. Thus  both theory and experimental evidence imply that  in order to use data from natural disease outbreaks to determine the host genetic influence underlying infectious disease  current quantitative genetics methodology must be modified to take transmission dynamics into account. In quantitative genetic analyses  it is customary to assume that binary data is the realisation of a probability. Thus an important step is to identify the probability function that links the epidemiological parameters of interest  such as susceptibility and infectiousness  to the probability of becoming infected. Therefore  the aim of this study was to derive an analytical expression for the probability of an individual to become infected within a given time period. We demonstrate how this can be achieved by integrating fundamental principles of epidemiology into the quantitative genetics framework. We then validate this analytical expression by comparing it with established theory in the case of homogeneous populations and by using simulated disease data generated for a range of epidemiological scenarios in genetically heterogeneous populations. Finally  we examine the implications for implementing this probability function into quantitative genetic analyses. The study of infectious diseases typically falls within the realm of epidemiology. A key measure in epidemiology is the basic reproductive ratio   defined as the expected number of secondary infections that one infectious individual causes in an otherwise susceptible population []. Efforts for epidemiological control of infections are targeted to reduce   ideally to a value below one  because if  is less than one  infection is unlikely to spread and expected to die out. The higher  is  the greater are the risk and severity of epidemics []. This key definition points to two important host characteristics that control the spread of infection: first  the susceptibility of non-infected individuals  i.e. the propensity of becoming infected upon contact with an infectious individual or substance  and second  the infectiousness of the infected individuals  i.e. the ability of an infected individual to transmit the infection. As stipulated by Lloyd-Smith et al. []  for diseases transmitted by direct contact  infectiousness (or  using their terminology  individual reproductive number with population mean ) can be regarded as the product of three factors:   the rate at which an infectious individual comes into contact with others in the population;   the probability that the disease is transmitted to a susceptible individual  given contact; and   the duration of the infectious period. All three components may harbour exploitable genetic variation. Epidemiologists rely heavily on mathematical models of transmission dynamics to predict the outcome of control strategies. For instance  using a conventional compartmental  model that describes the transition of individuals between the Susceptible ()  Infected () and Recovered or Removed () compartment  the change in disease prevalence is described by  with parameters  (transmission coefficient) and  (recovery rate) []. This differential equation represents infection as a dynamic process that arises from the interaction between susceptible and infected individuals (through the use of a multiplicative term in  and ). The transmission coefficient  is the product of the contact rate and the probability that the contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual results in a successful transmission []  and thus  depends on the susceptibility of the susceptible individual and the infectiousness of the infectious individual. Furthermore  for  models with constant population size  the probability  of an initially susceptible individual to become infected within a time period  is given by Where (t)<U+2009>=<U+2009>R<U+2009>*<U+2009>R(t)/S  denotes the force of infection  i.e. the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected  and  and  are the number of recovered individuals at time t and the initial number of susceptible individuals  respectively []. Although epidemiologists acknowledge that there may be variation between individuals in both susceptibility and infectivity e.g. []  classical epidemiology assumes homogeneity between individuals or within subgroups of individuals and therefore excludes the concept of host genetics. However  this gap has been shown to have a profound impact on the prediction of disease risk and prevalence  e.g. [–]. In particular  recent field studies have elucidated the important role of super-spreaders  the small proportion of highly infectious individuals responsible for the majority of transmission events  on the occurrence and severity of disease outbreaks across a range of diseases [–]. Note that super-spreaders confer host heterogeneity in infectiousness  not in resistance. Therefore  understanding and controlling heterogeneity in infectiousness  i.e. not only resistance  is now recognized as an important measure to control disease []. However  to date  the genetic contribution of the host to this variation in infectiousness is unknown since genetic analyses tend to focus on disease resistance and  as demonstrated in [] and []  fail to fully capture host genetic variation in infectiousness  if present  from binary disease data. Binary disease phenotypes can be considered as the realization of a probability of having the observed disease phenotype. In this section  we will extend the epidemiological equation () for the (cumulative) probability of an individual to become infected by a time  for a heterogeneous host population with variation in both host susceptibility and infectiousness. For this purpose  we define  as the probability of an infectious individual  to infect a susceptible individual with unit susceptibility following contact  and  as the susceptibility of an individual  following contact with an infectious individual of unit infectivity. Furthermore  we define the indicator  to be equal to 1 if  is infectious at time  and to 0 otherwise. Then  the probability of a susceptible individual  of becoming infected following contact with individual  at time  is the product . Let  be the expected number of contacts in a unit time interval between individuals  and . Thus  following the same approach as in []  for a susceptible individual not to become infected in a unit time interval  none of the contacts must result in infection. In other words  the probability of a susceptible individual  to avoid getting infected in a unit time interval is equal to The probability  of a susceptible individual  to become infected during a sufficiently short time interval  during which the infection status of infectious individuals does not change is therefore  Let  be the probability of individual   which was susceptible at time zero  to have become infected by time . Then for a small time-step  Note  that this equation may encompass single and repeated infections (e.g. infected  recovered and re-infected) within the time interval from 0 to . Rearranging the above equation  dividing by  and taking the limit  leads to Note that the expression for  above can be written as Using the power series expansion of the exponential function  and dividing by dt and taking the limit  leads to using the approximation ln(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>x)<U+2009>˜<U+2009>-<U+2009>x  for small x. Substituting this last expression into the differential equation () yields Now  define so that Multiplying both sides of (10) so that by  and collecting all terms to the left hand side leads to or Hence  the solution of the differential equation () is The probability (0) can be estimated as the prevalence at the beginning of an observation period. For simplicity  however  from now on we will assume that (0)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 and hence  Note that the quantity () defined above can be written as where () denotes the duration of time within the interval [0  ] during which individual  is infectious. Thus  if  has not become infected by time   ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>0  otherwise where  denotes the number of times that individual  got infected during [0 t] and  and  denote the start and end of the corresponding infectious periods  respectively. Two forms of validation of the above derived probability function given by equation () with <U+039B>(t) defined in (15) were carried out. First  we assessed whether in the extreme case of zero heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectiousness  the derived function is consistent with existing epidemiological theory. Second  the function was validated with binary disease data (infected or not infected) generated by simulated stochastic epidemics in closed genetically heterogeneous populations of constant size  as described in detail in [  ]. Two methods were chosen to illustrate this second validation: (i) a direct comparison of the probability of infection predicted by the derived analytical expressions (14) and (15) with the proportion of individuals that became infected in the simulations  and (ii) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A ROC curve is a widely used graphical representation of the ability of a predictor to discriminate between cases and controls by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR<U+2009>=<U+2009>sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (FPR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1-specificity) []. Here  the ROC curves plot the proportion of infected individuals that have an estimated probability of infection greater than a given threshold (True Positives) against the proportion of non-infected individuals that have an estimated probability of infection greater than this same threshold (False Positives). Thus  the Area Under this Curve (AUC) describes the probability of correctly ranking any infected/non-infected pair of individuals using the derived probability function. Thus  if the analytical prediction is entirely unrelated to the probability of becoming infected in the simulations  then individuals would be classified at random and the AUC would be equal to 0.5. However  if our function accurately describes the probability of becoming infected in the simulations  then the AUC would be close but not equal to 1  due to the stochastic nature of the simulations. The stochastic epidemiological model used for validation simulates disease progression in isolated groups of  individuals and provides the disease status of individuals (infected/not infected) over time as output. The epidemic was simulated as a Poisson process  starting with one randomly chosen infected individual per group. The times at which subsequent infection and recovery events occurred and which individuals were affected were determined by the pairwise transmission parameters () and by the recovery rates ()  respectively  as outlined below. It was assumed that infected individuals became immediately infectious and remained infectious until they recovered. No transmission was assumed between groups. Individual variation in host susceptibility and infectiousness was first incorporated into the model by assigning for each individual  its own level of susceptibility  and infectivity  The dynamic  pairwise transmission parameter  was then calculated as: as derived in []. Thus  in line with standard epidemiological theory () encapsulates the contact rate and the transmission probability. To reflect whether susceptibility and infectivity are expressed at time   the individual constants  and  are scaled by () and  ()  respectively  which are equal to 1 if  is susceptible at time  and if  is infectious at time   respectively  and 0 otherwise. Similarly  individual recovery rates were assumed to be equal to ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>()  with <U+03B3> and  () as defined above. It was initially assumed that host susceptibility and infectivity were the only sources of individual variation. Thus  parameter <U+03B3> was set equal to 0.1 for all individuals. For simplicity  it was further assumed that the expected number of contacts per unit time interval between two individuals in the same group was homogeneous and  without loss of generality  was set equal to <U+2009>=<U+2009>1. This homogeneity assumption is likely to be satisfied in intensive farming conditions. The values of (t) and (t) were calculated at each event time  starting from time zero. Based on these  Gillespie’s direct algorithm was used to determine the next event (infection or recovery)  the time of the event and the affected individuals  as outlined in []. The simulation was run until the time  at which approximately 50% of individuals had become infected. In order to demonstrate that the derived probability function given by equations () and () is valid for a range of epidemiological models  binary disease data were also generated by simulating an epidemic using a stochastic SIR model with additional variation in recovery rate <U+03B3> and a stochastic SLIRS model  following the same principles as described above. In a SLIRS model  the epidemiological compartments are: Susceptible (S)  Latently infected but not infectious (L)  Infectious (I)  Recovered and temporarily immune (R)  and Susceptible (S). The speed of transition between compartments S and L is given by   as described above. Similarly  all other individual transition speeds were assumed equal to a constant value for individuals in the relevant compartment and 0 otherwise. Specifically  the constants were; 0.5 for L<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>I  0.1 for I<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>R and 0.2 for R<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>S. Similar to the previous simulation  it was assumed that the expected number of contacts between two individuals per time unit <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 for all individuals from the same group. This simulation was run until the same value of  as above  which resulted in approximately 58% of individuals becoming infected. Thus  the different epidemiological models used for simulation were (i) a SIR model with host variation in susceptibility and infectivity only; (ii) a SIR model with host variation in susceptibility  infectivity and recovery rate; and (iii) a SLIRS model with host variation in susceptibility and infectivity only. Each model was run for a population of size N<U+2009>=<U+2009>100 000 individuals  randomly divided into 10 000 isolated groups of size 10 chosen  which is equivalent to simulating 10 000 independent epidemics. Susceptibility and infectivity were assumed to be distributed according to a right-skewed gamma distribution <U+0413>()  which is representative for a variety of infectious diseases []. Moreover  skewed distributions allow for larger variation when the distribution is confined to positive values. For simplicity  susceptibility and infectivity were assumed to be independent. Similarly  additional individual variation in recovery rate was incorporated into the above described SIR model by sampling individual time to recovery 1/ from a right-skewed Gamma distribution G(2 5). In other words  it was assumed that most individuals recover quickly  that a few individuals may take a very long time to recover  and that the mean time to recovery was ten time units. This simulation was run until the same value of  as above  which resulted in approximately 41% of individuals becoming infected. Each epidemiological model provided the binary disease state (infected/not infected by time ) for every individual as output. Furthermore  the period of time during which each individual remained infectious (D) was recorded for validation purposes. Note that the duration of the infectious period D in equation () captures individual variation in the transmission speeds between compartments I  I R and RS. Knowledge of the infectious period  together with the known input values of c   and   allowed calculation of the quantity <U+039B>(t) using equation () and hence the probability of becoming infected by a time   based on equation (). This was then compared with the observed proportion of individuals that became infected by time  in the simulations  within a given class of <U+039B>(t). The class size for <U+039B>(t) was taken as 0.02 to ensure that sufficient records were available within each class. We first demonstrate that for homogeneous populations  equations () and () are consistent with existing epidemiological theory and with the method of survival analysis. In a homogeneous population  i.e. when there is no variation in susceptibility (g<U+2009>=<U+2009>g for each individual j)  infectivity (f<U+2009>=<U+2009>f for all k)  contact rate (c<U+2009>=<U+2009>c for all j  k) or any of the other epidemiological parameters  equation () becomes Also  following equation ()  in the case of homogeneity  for any pair consisting of a susceptible individual  and an infectious individual  (i.e. X(t)<U+2009>=<U+2009>X(t)<U+2009>=<U+2009>1)  the transmission coefficient is for small values of  and . Furthermore  the sum of the infectious period of each individual in a group  within the time interval from 0 to  can be written as where I(t) denotes the number of infectious individuals at time t. In an SIR model with constant recovery rate <U+03B3>  the number of recovered individuals  R  changes over time according to /<U+2009>=<U+2009>()  thus yielding the following for the above sum over infectious periods Note that in an SIR model  the basic reproductive ratio R is where S is the number of susceptible individuals at the start of the epidemic []. Substituting equations () to (21) into (17)  yields for <U+039B>(t)<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+039B>(t) and hence for P(t)<U+2009>=<U+2009>P(t) according to equation () Hence  the expression for the probability of becoming infected derived  as in the paragraph “Epidemiological principles and approaches” for heterogeneous populations  i.e. equation ()  is consistent with equation () from epidemiological literature if there is no individual variation. The probability function (14) is also consistent with the notion of failure in survival analysis  where the failure function F(t) represents the probability of failure by time  and is defined as ()<U+2009>=<U+2009>1<U+2009>-<U+2009>  where <U+039B>(t) is the cumulative hazard function []. In this context  failure represents becoming infected. Therefore  equation () can be considered a failure function with a cumulative hazard function given by equation (). Figure  shows the proportion of individuals that had become infected by time  in the epidemiological simulations  for a given time  and calculated values of <U+039B>(t)  as well as the analytical expression for the probability of becoming infected derived in equations () and (). Figures a b and c indicate that the probability function provides a good fit to the probability of becoming infected. Moreover  this function provides a robust fit across a range of epidemiological scenarios  as shown in Figures a b and c for  respectively  the SIR model with variation in susceptibility and infectivity  with additional variation in recovery rate  and the SLIRS model. Note that parameter values used in the simulations (see the above paragraph “Derivation of a genetic-epidemiological probability function”) are arbitrary and not expected to affect the fit.      For details regarding simulation parameters see paragraph “Derivation of a genetic-epidemiological probability function“; data points: proportion of infected individuals for a given class of <U+039B>(t) using equation () with class size 0.02; curve: expected probability of becoming infected by time  following equations () and (); panels: .

Figure  shows ROC curves for predicting whether an individual has become infected or not by time   with the derived probability given by equations () and () as the classification criterion. According to Figure   the derived probability is effective at predicting whether an individual will become infected or not by time   in a manner that is consistent with an accurate probability function  i.e. with an AUC that is close to  but not equal to  1. Moreover  the predictive ability of the derived probability function is robust across a range of epidemiological scenarios  with an AUC between 96-97% for all simulations.      Curves: green<U+2009>=<U+2009>data from simulation of the SIR model with variation in susceptibility and infectivity (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.964); blue<U+2009>=<U+2009>data from simulation of SIR model with variation in susceptibility  infectivity and recovery rate (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.960); brown<U+2009>=<U+2009>data from simulation of SLIRS model with variation in susceptibility and infectivity (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.970); black<U+2009>=<U+2009>random classification (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5); grey<U+2009>=<U+2009>perfect classification (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). The probability function (14)  with <U+039B>(t) defined in (15)  captures different sources of host (genetic) variation  which may not be easy to estimate in practice. In particular  whereas susceptibility  and infectivity  may harbour substantial genetic variation  the duration of the infectious period  within a given time interval are more likely to depend upon a combination of various genetic (e.g.     and also in <U+03B3>) and environmental (e.g.  choice of time interval)  or other stochastic factors. In order to determine the importance of estimating these components of <U+039B>(t) for predicting the future disease status of an individual  ROC curves were also generated with the classification criterion estimated by assuming either no (genetic) heterogeneity in  and  (i.e. calculating <U+039B>(t) according to equation ())  or by assuming genetic heterogeneity but equal non-dynamic exposure ( for each individual ) in the probability function. The first scenario may be considered to be in line with current epidemiological theory  as outlined in the above paragraph “Derivation of a genetic-epidemiological probability function“ (equation ())  whereas the second scenario may be considered to be more in line with current quantitative genetics theory that ignores dynamic exposure. Note that exact values of D(t) may not be available from field data and  therefore  using the further approximation from equation () is more in line with current epidemiological practice. However  applying this approximation results in discrete values of D(t) rather than a continuous curve (results not shown). Nonetheless  the resulting discrete values are close to the curve obtained without using this approximation. Figure  shows a comparison of the ROC curves that correspond to these ‘epidemiological’ and ‘genetic’ assumptions  with the ROC curve that combines genetics and epidemiology in the derived expression for <U+039B>(t) outlined in equation (). The ROC curves in Figure  reveal that quantifying the exposure over time explains most of the ability to predict whether an individual will become infected or not. Furthermore  predictions of an individual’s disease status are considerably improved when all sources of genetic and epidemiological variation are included in the calculations.  ROC curves calculated with data from simulation of the SIR model with variation in susceptibility and infectivity; the classification criterion used was the probability function equation () with <U+039B> including different sources of variation; curves in green<U+2009>=<U+2009>‘’ - <U+039B> includes all sources of variation and was estimated based on equation () (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.964); orange<U+2009>=<U+2009>‘’ - <U+039B> was estimated assuming no (genetic) variation in susceptibility and infectivity  as in equation () (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.895); purple<U+2009>=<U+2009>‘’ - <U+039B> was estimated assuming (genetic) variation in susceptibility and infectivity  but equal non-dynamic exposure  i.e.  for each individual  (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.710); black<U+2009>=<U+2009>random classification (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5); grey<U+2009>=<U+2009>perfect classification (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). Using mathematical principles  a genetic – epidemiological probability function was derived that links binary disease data to the underlying epidemiological traits  host susceptibility and infectiousness. The function is an extension of the established epidemiological equation for the probability of becoming infected by a time  (1) from homogeneous to heterogeneous populations. Indeed  in line with epidemiological theory  the quantity <U+039B>(t) described in equation () may be called  of an individual  at time t. Defining infectiousness of individual  towards individual  until time  as the product <U+03D5>()<U+2009>=<U+2009>()  as previously postulated by Lloyd-Smith et al. []  simplifies the expression for <U+039B>(t) to: Thus  the force of infection for an individual  is the product of the individual’s susceptibility and the cumulative infectiousness of its group members towards it  which reflects that an infectious disease results from interactions between susceptible and infectious individuals. Note that under the assumption that <U+2009>=<U+2009> for each individual   the infectiousness () derived here corresponds to the individual reproductive number with population mean R  as defined in epidemiological literature []. In the context of quantitative genetics  the cumulative infectiousness replaces the concept of exposure. Rather than an equal  constant and purely environmental exposure  as is typically assumed []  the individual force of infection in equation () illustrates that exposure depends on the number of infectious individuals  which may change over time as their infection status changes  as well as on their contact behaviour and infectivity  where some or all of these components may be partly genetically determined. In particular  the time  during which an individual remains infected may be partly genetically determined since it encapsulates several mechanisms that are determined by the immune system  such as recovery and latency. Thus  there is potentially much to be gained by incorporating epidemiological information into genetic analyses  and vice-versa  as illustrated in Figure . The concept that an individual’s phenotype is not only controlled by its own genes but also by the genes of interacting individuals is not new in quantitative genetics  and has already been successfully incorporated in the form of indirect (or associative) genetics effect (IGE) models [–]. We have previously applied such IGE models to estimate genetic parameters associated with host susceptibility and infectivity from simulated binary disease data [  ]  and found that IGE models can indeed capture some of the genetic variation underlying infectiousness. However  we have also found use of the current IGE framework in the context of infectious disease to have shortcomings since crucial dynamic aspects are ignored  which leads to bias in parameter estimates []. As outlined in more detail below  the derived genetic-epidemiological probability function offers a means to extend the current IGE model framework to infectious diseases in populations that display genetic variation in diverse epidemiological traits for which expression varies throughout the time course of infection. In order to incorporate susceptibility and infectiousness into genetic selection programs  knowledge of the respective genetic (co)variances is required. Moreover  it might be desirable to use estimated breeding values of these traits for genetic selection or for genome-wide association studies. Estimation of breeding values by best linear unbiased prediction requires not only knowledge of the genetic variance [] but also the use of mixed models  as these allow simultaneous estimation of fixed effects and random genetic effects []. Susceptibility and infectiousness are difficult to measure directly and  as was assumed in this paper  field disease data is often binary  indicating whether an individual became infected or not. It is customary to use a generalized linear (mixed) model (GL(M)M) to analyse binary or categorical data []. In such models  the observed trait is linked to an assumed linear model of the underlying continuous trait(s) via a non-linear link function. Canonical link functions that are commonly used for binary data are the probit and logit link functions []  which assume that the probability of the trait to be equal to one  i.e. to have become infected in our case  follows a cumulative normal or a logistic distribution  respectively []. Despite their convenient mathematical properties  neither distribution  however  arises naturally from epidemiological theory  as demonstrated in the present study. A consequence of this is that interpretation of such analyses in terms of epidemiological parameters is problematic at best. A suitable link function for a GL(M)M transforms the observed trait into a linear expression of the parameters of interest. However  in the genetic epidemiological probability function P(t) (equation () with <U+039B>(t) defined in equation ())  the parameters of interest  i.e. the epidemiological traits susceptibility and infectiousness  enter in a multiplicative rather than in a linear manner. However  if there was genetic variation in susceptibility   it follows from equations () and () that the probability P(t) can be linked to the following linear model in susceptibility using a complementary log-log link function: Assuming no genetic variation in the epidemiological traits    and  that underlie infectiousness  the second summand of equation () can be considered to be an error term e(t). However  in contrast to using the canonical logit and probit link functions  this model captures and completely separates the individual’s susceptibility from the dynamic aspects of exposure. However  when there is genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectiousness  it is not straightforward to link the probability P(t) of becoming infected to a linear model that includes both susceptibility and infectiousness. Indeed  the complementary log-log link function (24) is no longer adequate when there is variation in infectiousness since the logarithm of a sum does not equal the sum of the logarithms. It is  however  possible to linearize the force of infection from equation ()  in both susceptibility and infectiousness  using e.g. the Taylor series expansion of  near the population mean susceptibility  and the population mean infectiousness  up to time : Note that the Taylor series of <U+039B>(t) in equation () is not truncated and that it includes only one non-linear term in susceptibility and infectiousness. Following a GL(M)M framework  if the last term of equation () was negligible  the expression for <U+039B>(t) would be linear and thus an appropriate link between observed binary disease data (infected or not infected) and the underlying epidemiological traits  host susceptibility and infectiousness. Note that truncating equation () after the linear terms in  and () corresponds to an IGE model for the individual force of infection <U+039B>(t). IGE models describe the phenotype P (here P<U+2009>=<U+2009><U+039B>(t)) of an individual  as a linear combination of the individual’s direct effect P  and the cumulate indirect (or associative) effect P of its group members  i.e. with an underlying genetic component for both the direct and indirect effects and with µ denoting the population mean phenotype  e.g. [  ]. The connection between host infectiousness and indirect effects has been established previously [] but the exact nature of this connection was unknown. Thus  comparison of the linear part of equation () with equation () offers a new interpretation of direct and indirect effects in this context and of previous results. Indeed  according to equation ()  the direct effect corresponds to the susceptibility of individual  (expressed as deviation from the population mean susceptibility)  scaled by the cumulative average infectiousness of the group members up to time   and the indirect (or associative) effect of a group member corresponds to its infectiousness (expressed as deviation from the population mean infectiousness until time )  scaled by the average population susceptibility. Furthermore  equation () may shed some light on potential causes for the previously observed bias in the genetic parameter estimates in infectivity []. This bias may have resulted from the inadequacy of the linear and logit models used in the previous analyses  as neither emerges from epidemiological theory and the appropriate link function was yet unknown. Furthermore  as illustrated in equation ()  the non-linear interaction between susceptibility and infectiousness may become non-negligible if there are large deviations in infectiousness  from the population mean. This is illustrated in Figure   which shows the ROC curves with the classification criterion estimated with the full (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.964) and truncated (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.751) versions of equation (). In other words  in the presence of super-spreaders  i.e. highly infectious individuals  the use of a GL(M)M or any other linear framework is likely to create bias. For the purpose of identifying super-spreaders  it would therefore be desirable to develop computational algorithms that do not require linear approximations of the force of infection function. Such non-linear algorithms would also be needed to disentangle the individual components of infectiousness  e.g. to separate genetic variation in the ability to transmit the infection upon exposure (i.e. variation in ) from genetic variation in the duration of the infectious period (i.e. variation in ). These sources of variation likely correspond to different immunological processes (e.g. shedding vs. recovery) and may therefore be controlled by different sets of genes. However  separating infectiousness components in genetic analyses may come with additional data requirements. For example  repeated binary measurement of an individual’s disease status over time rather than one single snapshot in time may be required to infer genetic variation in the duration of the infectious period. These measurements may be taken from on-going epidemics by using equation () instead of (14)  with P(0) equal to the prevalence of the disease in the first observation. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods []  with their hierarchical iterative sampling process  appear well suited to incorporate the dynamic expression of host susceptibility and infectiousness. Such methods may also lend themselves more easily to the consideration of other uncertainties that frequently affect observed disease phenotypes  such as incomplete sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests.  Data from simulation of the SIR model with variation in susceptibility and infectivity; curves in green<U+2009>=<U+2009>the probability function with lambda estimated as in equation () used as classification criterion (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.964); brown (overlapping with green curve)<U+2009>=<U+2009>the probability function with lambda estimated using the Taylor expansion from equation () used as classification criterion (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.964); purple<U+2009>=<U+2009>an IGE model (equation ()) used as classification criterion (AUC<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.751); black<U+2009><U+2009>random classification; grey<U+2009>=<U+2009>perfect classification. We have derived a genetic epidemiological function for quantitative genetic analyses of binary infectious disease data that takes genetic variation and the dynamic expression of host infectiousness into account. The function describes the probability of an individual to become infected given its own susceptibility and the infectiousness of its group mates. When variation is limited to host susceptibility  it is possible to estimate genetic variation for this trait in a manner compatible with epidemiological dynamics using the complementary log-log link function. When there is genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectiousness  it is possible to use the logarithmic link function with a linear IGE model but this is likely to generate prediction bias if there is a large variation in infectiousness. Future work will concentrate on developing computational algorithms that can incorporate the genetic epidemiological function without linear approximations  in order to identify potential genetic super-spreaders. These algorithms would enable us to uncover the genetics underlying epidemics and thus shape the epidemics of tomorrow. Bishop SC  Woolliams JA: On the genetic interpretation of disease data.

Coccidia are animal parasites that are present mainly in the intestines and cause coccidiosis. Coccidia are sub-classified into several genera  including        and . Here  the term ‘coccidiosis’ refers exclusively to the genus  that is the major cause of parasitic avian coccidiosis with huge economic losses to the poultry industry. Estimates put the annual worldwide cost of coccidiosis to poultry production at up to 2 billion dollars[].   which develops in the cecum  is one of the most frequent coccidian species involved in chicken coccidiosis. It causes depression of body weight gain  lesions and  in the most serious cases  death of infected animals. Progress has been made in the development of recombinant vaccines against coccidiosis but none is yet available for use in the poultry industry. Moreover  the use of anticoccidial drugs raises several issues from both an environmental and food-chain perspective and a drug resistance issue. Genetic variability for resistance to coccidiosis in the chicken has been demonstrated[  ] and if this natural resistance could be exploited  it would reduce the costs of the disease. Using a low-density genetic map (157 microsatellites) and a single-QTL model  Pinard-van der Laan et al.[] characterized the genetic regulation of  resistance in a Fayoumi<U+2009>×<U+2009>Leghorn F cross (Fayoumi and Leghorn breeds are respectively resistant and susceptible to coccidiosis[]) and identified 21 QTL (quantitative trait locus). Today  the possibility to generate high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data and the use of more complex models that can test multiple QTL in the same linkage group have dramatically increased the power and accuracy of such analyses. In this work  we used a custom SNP array and novel quantitative models to re-analyze the Fayoumi<U+2009>×<U+2009>Leghorn F design. In addition  as one objective of this study was to find an index capable of explaining a large amount of the variance associated with resistance to coccidiosis  a composite variable was produced using the five studied traits and used for QTL detection. The experimental design is detailed in[]. Briefly  a F cross was produced using three roosters and seven hens from the Fayoumi (resistant) line and three roosters and six hens from the Leghorn (susceptible) line. Among the F animals  six roosters and 30 hens (six groups of sisters  one group per rooster) were randomly mated to produce 860 F of both sexes[]. F animals were challenged for coccidiosis resistance at the ANSES Parasitology unit at Ploufragan. Chickens were weighed at 26 days of age  separated according to sex and dam family into similar-weight groups. Inoculation was performed at 28 days of age with a dose of 50 000  oocysts[]. Challenged birds were slaughtered at 36 days of age  i.e. 8 days post-inoculation. Body weight gain (WG) was measured as WG<U+2009>=<U+2009>100<U+2009>×<U+2009>(body weight (8 days post-inoculation) – body weight (2 days pre-inoculation))/body weight (2 days pre-inoculation). Blood was sampled at 4 days post-inoculation to measure plasma coloration (PC  as a measure of the level of blood carotenoid) as PC<U+2009>=<U+2009>log(optical density at 480 nm) and hematocrit level (HEMA). Rectal body temperature (T°) was measured 4 days post-inoculation. At slaughter  cecal lesion scores (LES) were assessed by the same skilled pathologist on a scale of 0 (no lesion) to 4 (most severe lesions)[]. Briefly  the duodenum and jejunum were extracted and anonymized before the pathologist opened them. The score was assessed based on the mucosa structure conservation and blood clot content. All procedures were conducted under Licence No. 37–123 from the Veterinary Services  Indre-et-Loire  France and in accordance with guidelines for Care and Use of Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching (French Agricultural Agency and Scientific Research Agency). F sires were first genotyped for a set of 9216 SNPs. This preliminary step enabled us to select fully informative markers to genotype the F2 individuals i.e. 1536 SNPs that were distributed over all the sequenced genome were selected based on informativity and location using MarkerSet[]. The 157 microsatellites already genotyped in the previous approach were included in the dataset. MendelSoft[] was used to correct data for possible Mendelian genetics problems. Of the 1693 markers (1536 SNPs and 157 microsatellites)  1393 were kept for further analysis [see Additional file: Table S1] and 296 markers were eliminated due to technical problems (call rate lower than 85% and/or Mendelian errors higher than 5%). The chicken linkage consensus map constructed by Groenen et al.[] was used to determine the genetic location of the markers. Locations of markers unavailable in the consensus map were extrapolated based on flanking markers. Local ratio between genetic (cM) and physical distances (Mb) between two flanking markers a and b [(cM – cM)/(Mb – Mb)] was used to extrapolate the genetic location of a marker m by taking into consideration its physical distance from the previous marker cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>cM<U+2009>+<U+2009>[(Mb – Mb)<U+2009>×<U+2009>ratio]. A fundamental model capable of explaining observed associations among variables might be suitable  potentially a latent variable model[]. A factor analysis for all the original traits (resistance criteria) was performed  and one first-order factor termed composite variable F1 was extracted using  by []. Single-QTL detection analyses were run using GridQTL[] and QTLMap software[]. To be able to make comparisons with the previous study[]  the F model was used in GridQTL. For QTLMap  an interval mapping method was applied and no assumptions about either the fixation of the alleles in the founder lines or the number of segregating alleles at the QTL were made. A mixture of half and full-sib families was considered as pedigree structure  and only the sire meiosis was studied. For each trait  an LRT value was calculated at each cM to compare the fit of two models (i.e. the model with a QTL at the location considered  the model without fitting any QTL effect). Chromosome-wide significance thresholds were evaluated through empirical calculations obtained by simulations under the null hypothesis. A total of 1000 simulations and 1000 permutations were performed for each trait<U+2009>×<U+2009>chromosome combination. Confidence intervals on QTL positions were estimated by the drop-off method[]. Similarly to the reduction of one LOD when using LOD scores  the maximum LRT value was reduced by 3.84 (a  distribution with one degree of freedom for <U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) to determine a threshold. Region boundaries were then defined by the LRT locations crossing this threshold upstream and downstream of the peak LRT. Multi-QTL analyses were also performed using QTLMap software  with the hypothesis that two linked QTL influenced the same trait[]. These analyses applied two approaches. When a QTL is identified in a linkage group  the H1 hypothesis (there is one QTL in the linkage group) was compared to the H2 hypothesis (there are two QTL in the linkage group)  which is particularly useful to test whether another QTL might be segregating elsewhere in the linkage group. When no QTL was detected for a linkage group<U+2009>×<U+2009>trait combination  the H0 (no QTL in the linkage group) was compared to the H2 hypothesis to test for potential segregation of two antagonistic QTL. In both cases  the two QTL locations under H2 are estimated considering all possible combinations based on a two-dimensional grid. For all these analyses  significance thresholds were determined by simulating performances under the null hypothesis of the test to obtain an empirical distribution of the LRT in accordance with the pedigree and marker information. For the two  one QTL test  performances were simulated under the one QTL hypothesis. The most likely location and effect estimated in the no  one QTL test were used to define QTL effect on performances. QTL effects were calculated as the average of all absolute values for heterozygous sire effects  and expressed in trait units. For each QTL region  genomic coordinates of confidence interval limits were determined on the basis of the chicken linkage consensus map constructed by Groenen et al.[]  as described previously. The list of genes present in each QTL region was extracted using AnnotQTL[] on the WUGSC 2.1 (galGal3) assembly. The functions and interactions of these genes were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA ). The 860 F animals were genotyped for 1393 genetic markers and QTL mapping was performed for the following traits: body weight gain (WG)  plasma coloration (PC)  hematocrit level (HEMA)  rectal body temperature (T°)  cecal lesion score (LES). A composite variable (F1) that represents most of the variance present in these traits was derived. Single-QTL analyses using QTLMap and GridQTL detected 9 and 19 chromosome-wide significant QTL (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)  respectively (Table ). Each of the five traits studied and the composite variable F1 were associated to at least one QTL. The confidence interval sizes ranged from 1 cM (QTL for WG on  chromosome GGA22) to 18 cM (T° on GGA18) with a mean of 5.9 cM  which is much smaller than the values usually obtained when using microsatellites only (12 cM on average between markers that flank the QTL). This illustrates the gain in location accuracy obtained by a 10-fold increase in genetic marker density. Interestingly  on GGA19 and GGA24  different QTL for some of the traits studied and the composite variable F1 mapped to the same location  which suggests the presence of pleiotropic QTL. On GGA24  the three detected QTL for LES  PC and composite variable F1 were positioned at the same location i.e. 4 cM  while on GGA19  three QTL were detected at 19 cM and one at 25 cM with various confidence interval sizes i.e. 18–20 cM containing QTL for LES and PC  20–29 cM containing a QTL for HEMA and 18–28 cM containing a QTL for composite variable F1 (Table ). Further multivariate analyses would be valuable to dissect more finely these two chromosomes. Under the H0  H2 test  four QTL for composite variable F1 and LES were identified on GGA21 i.e. one pair at 19 and 20 cM and another pair at 25 and 24 cM (Table ). Since in each pair the QTL were co-located  it is likely that there are only two QTL that affect LES and that their effects are also captured by the F1 composite variable. The hypothesis tested under the H0  H2 model is that two closely-located QTL but in repulsion phase (i.e. the favorable allele of the first QTL is in linkage disequilibrium with the unfavorable allele of the second QTL) are not identified by single-QTL analysis since their average effect is close to zero[  ]. This is confirmed by the fact that the two QTL for composite variable F1 and the two QTL for LES were separated by only about 5 cM (Table ) and showed similar antagonist effects in the six sire families analyzed (Table ). In addition  identification of these two QTL positions on GGA21 using the H0  H2 model may also be explained by the fact that estimating two QTL effects together provides more power and more precision for the localization of each QTL[]. An alternative H1  H2 hypothesis was tested for all chromosome<U+2009>×<U+2009>trait combinations for which a single QTL was previously detected. However  no additional QTL was identified using this strategy. One objective of this study was to find an index capable of explaining a large amount of the variance associated with resistance to coccidiosis. The new composite variable F1 was highly and positively correlated with WG  HEMA and PC and negatively correlated with LES (Table ). About 74% of the original variance was explained by the composite variable F1 only. Considering single-QTL and multi-QTL analyses together  eight QTL for composite variable F1 were detected among which six co-localized with one or more QTL for the traits studied and the best example is the co-location of four QTL for the composite variable F1  HEMA  LES and PC on GGA19. Thus  using a composite variable like F1 is useful since it confirmed the detection of QTL regions that affected more than one trait i.e. on GGA19 and 24 and also captured part of the variability that was missed using single traits (GGA3  9 and 21). However  while the composite variable F1 was associated with some of the QTL regions  it did not identify most of the regions identified in the single-QTL analysis. Thus  the composite variable F1 is not a sufficiently good index to explain the variance associated with resistance to coccidiosis. For all the QTL detected with QTLMap  the parental origin of the allele associated with the highest value of the trait (here  \"strong QTL allele\") was determined. Parental origins and additive effects that estimate the differences between the resistant Fayoumi and susceptible Leghorn lines are in Table . Animals severely affected by coccidiosis are expected to present high LES values but reduced values for HEMA  PC  WG and T°. Therefore  since the Fayoumi line is supposed to be more resistant to  than the Leghorn line  it is hypothesized that the Fayoumi alleles will be associated with high HEMA  PC  WG and T° values while the Leghorn alleles will be associated with high LES values. The composite variable F1 cannot be considered in this analysis  since it is impossible to predict which breed would have the favorable combination. In the single-QTL analyses  only one QTL was found to have all the high value alleles originating from the same breed. Indeed  all the favorable alleles of the QTL for WG on GGA1 originated from the Fayoumi line  as expected. For the other QTL detected in the single-QTL analyses  which all affected T°  most of the alleles that were associated with a high rectal body temperature originated from the Leghorn line  as expected given this breed’s susceptibility to coccidiosis. Multi-QTL analyses showed that the allele origins were equally shared between the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines and provided no further insight. Taken together  these results show that the QTL are not fixed in the founder lines (there is no QTL for which all F animals are heterozygous and all favorable alleles segregate from the same line) and confirm that most of the favorable alleles (i.e. associated to resistance performances) are segregating in the Fayoumi breed. Most of the QTL reported in this study are not described in the literature[]. Twenty-eight chromosome-wide significant QTL (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) were detected by applying interval mapping strategies with QTLMap and GridQTL. However  the use of a dense genetic map made it possible to test more complex hypotheses (multi-QTL analyses in QTLMap) and to map four new QTL. This study was a follow-up to an experiment reported in[]  which applied the QTLexpress \"F\" model and a selective genotyping strategy that used a low-density marker map comprising 157 microsatellites over 22 chromosomes. To compare the two studies  the locations of the markers from the first study were transposed to the genetic map used here. Only three QTL i.e. for WG on GGA1  T° on GGA2 and HEMA on GGA6 were common between the two studies. The QTL carried by GGA3 at 227 cM can also be considered as common since it had an effect on the composite variable F1 in the present study and on WG and PC in the microsatellite-based study. If we consider only the results obtained by the GridQTL F model  only two common QTL are detected i.e. the QTL for T° on GGA2 and for HEMA on GGA6. Surprisingly  although our study included more markers and animals  the QTL significance was lower  which could be explained by the fact that using only extreme animals artificially increased the QTL effect and therefore the test value[]. Taken together these results illustrate the differences in accuracy and robustness obtained when using the same model on 260 F animals genotyped for 157 microsatellites  860 F animals genotyped for 1393 genetic markers (including the157 microsatellites). Comparison of the results obtained with the QTLMap half-sib model and the GridQTL \"F\" model on the full dataset (860 F individuals and 1393 genetic markers) revealed only one common QTL for T° on GGA2  although the QTL locations were slightly different. QTL were also identified at the same location on GGA22  but for different traits (LES with the QTLMap half-sib model and WG and composite variable F1 with the GridQTL \"F\" model). This might correspond to a complex region regulating different traits  but only some of the traits are captured depending on the model used. In addition  both methods identified a QTL for WG on GGA1 but at different locations. However  the hypothesis that two different QTL for WG might be segregating on GGA1 was not confirmed under the multi-QTL analysis using QTLMap. The observed differences between these two models are clearly due to the different assumptions they are based on. The \"F\" option of GridQTL assumes that QTL alleles are fixed in founder populations  whereas the QTLMap option \"mixture of full and half-sib family\" assumes that there are as many QTL alleles as founders. In addition  the probabilities of transmission are computed differently[]  and assumptions on both the QTL effect and residual variances (i.e. homoscedastic or heteroscedastic models) are also different. Differences in how the residual variance is modeled are shown by the average order of magnitude of additive values for the QTL detected  which is clearly influenced by the number of parameters to be estimated. It is worth noting that whatever the model or design (full or extremes) used  the QTL for T° on GGA2 is always detected and thus  can be considered a promising QTL for further investigation. In order to identify possible candidate genes in the QTL regions detected  we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to derive functional annotations of these genes  with special emphasis on pathways or biological functions related to both the challenge applied for coccidiosis resistance and the traits measured  such as immune response  inflammatory response  response to infectious diseases  hematological system and carotenoid metabolism. The list of putative candidate genes identified (symbols and full names) [see Additional file: Table S2]. A network of interacting molecules involved in immune response to infectious diseases was generated and included eight genes (              ) and several genes of the  locus (Figure A) present in seven different QTL regions that were mainly related to weight gain and temperature. This network is centered both on the class II MHC pathway of antigen presentation  where the MHC class II molecules present extracellular peptides (such as the peptides derived from ) to the T-cell receptor (TCR) of CD4 T-cells  and on the pathway of the induction of cytokines like IFN<U+03B3>. In the  locus  the genes directly involved in class II antigen presentation are    and []. This network of candidate genes is compatible with QTL regions involved in the pathway of presentation of -derived antigens to initiate adaptive immune and inflammatory responses. Efficient induction of the immune response against  by antigen-presenting cells has been demonstrated[]  as well as the role of IFN<U+03B3> in increasing the weight of chicken infected by [].  The candidate genes were identified as  involved in the pathway of immune response to infectious diseases   involved in the coagulation pathway  and  candidate genes from the two QTL regions on chromosome GGA21 that was detected by multi-QTL screening; the network illustrates molecular interactions between the products of the candidate genes selected from the QTL regions; relations were determined using information contained in the IPA relationships database; the color code indicates the genes that are contained in a given QTL region; the white color indicates gene products that were added in the IPA analysis because of their interaction with the target gene products. Coccidiosis infection causes intestinal bleeding  particularly in the cecum and results in a decreased hematocrit count. We have identified a network of genes (             and ) present in six different QTL regions  centered on the amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP; Figure B) and involved in blood clot fibrinolysis. In particular  SERPINE2 and APLP2 control the cleavage of plasminogen (PLG) that releases active fibrinolotytic plasmin. Moreover  the  and  genes are present in QTL regions that affect HEMA. Using a specific approach  we targeted the genes from the QTL regions identified for the composite variable F1 and the LES trait on chromosome GGA21 by the multi-QTL approach. As stated earlier  the hypothesis is that the region contains two closely-located QTL but in repulsion phase  which is compatible with a scenario in which two candidate genes interact in the same functional network. Among the genes present in these two QTL regions  we identified four putative candidate genes  three being located in the same QTL region (Figure C).  and   which code for proteins that interact directly with AKT and indirectly with ERK  two protein families involved in signaling pathways  among which the PIK3-Akt-mTOR pathway is crucial for lymphocyte development. Interestingly  it has recently been shown in humans that gain-of-function mutations in the gene  induced phosphorylation of AKT and activation of mTOR  leading to premature T-cell senescence and immunodeficiency[]. Many of the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis/catabolism were contained in some of the QTL regions detected: four genes from the retinol-binding protein (RBP) family (      )       and . All these genes may have a role on PC  which reflects the amount of carotenoids in the plasma. Note that  is also known to be involved in the determinism of chicken muscle yellow color[]. This approach based on the functional investigation of genes from different QTL regions narrows down the list of putative candidate genes by exploiting their documented interactions in biological pathways related to the study.

The cost of  infection or haemonchosis for the production sectors of sheep farming in terms of anthelmintic treatments that are currently the most popular control strategy  and the resulting economic loss have been estimated in different countries to be in the order of several million dollars per year [–]. Furthermore  anthelmintics tend to select the parasite population under treatment for resistance to the anthelmintic itself [  ]  which increases the cost of haemonchosis even more. Both the long-term loss of efficacy and the growing public concern for the use of chemicals in food production fostered the research on alternative control strategies or combinations of them []  among which genetic selection is one of the most promising approaches [–]. Simulation studies based on evolutionary genetics [] predict a breeding plan’s long-term outcomes and also the efficacy of genetic selection as a control strategy. Since genetic improvement depends on the genetic parameters of the traits under selection  the estimates of these parameters must be as precise as possible for reliable long-term predictions. However  consistent estimates of the genetic correlation between production traits and parasite resistance traits have not been reported in the literature [–]. Since most of the estimates found in the literature are computed from observations in natural conditions  where it is not possible to precisely define neither the nutritional level of the diet nor the larval challenge on the pasture  the reason why no consistent estimates are available may be due to the interaction between these two factors []. The first objective of this study was to estimate the heritability of average daily gain and faecal egg count from experimental observations  together with the genetic correlations between them. We report the results of an analysis performed on 1004 phenotypic records of growth traits and faecal egg counts collected on genotyped (50 k SNPchip) back-cross lambs (25% Martinique black belly and 75% Romane)  following two experimental infestations with  The genetic parameters have been estimated both by using pedigree information only and pedigree and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chip information jointly. Computing the relatedness between individuals using pedigree information only is based on expectation and results in an estimate corresponding to the average number of alleles shared by two individuals  for example: all the individuals belonging to the same full-sibs group would have a coefficient of 0.5 between each other  which means that it does not take into account the deviation from this average caused by segregation and recombination. However  including molecular information makes it possible to compute the relatedness between individuals by identifying on a relatively dense map the actual number of alleles they share  which provides a more detailed estimate of the relatedness between individuals []. Since the observations used in this study were collected on four large groups of half-sibs  the second objective of the study was to test whether including SNP information could help reach more precise estimates than using pedigree information only when the pedigree of the population is poorly informative. Although previous studies have already explored the amount of genetic variability for parasite resistance traits  this study features several novelties: the genetic parameters reported here are estimated from phenotypes collected in experimental settings rather than natural infestation  the growth traits analysed are the average daily gains before infestation and during infestation rather than the body weights  and finally the estimates reported here also feature molecular information rather than pedigree information only. The population in which the observations were collected from resulted from a back-cross mating scheme between two pure-bred populations: Martinique Black Belly (MBB) and Romane (ROM). MBB is a tropical sheep breed  which is characterized by adaptation to heat-stress  to parasitism and to extensive raising conditions. The ROM sheep breed features good productive performances (both for meat production and prolificacy) and no selection for resistance to parasites. The pedigree used in the analysis (Figure ) was three generations deep and counted a total of 3164 animals. Four F1 sires were produced by crossing MBB and ROM individuals. The sires were mated by intra-uterine artificial insemination to 829 pure-bred ROM dams in order to obtain 1265 back-cross offspring (BC)  the number of animals used in this study from each group of half-sibs were 282  251  247 and 223  respectively. All animals were managed as a commercial flock  the experimental protocol complied to the European ethical policy and was approved by the ethical committee “comite d’ethique CIRAD-INRA”.  MBB: Martinique Black Belly; ROM: Romane; FI are the four F1 sires resulting from the cross between MBB sires and ROM dams; BC is the back cross population obtained by mating the F1 sires to ROM dams. A total of 1044 animals among the population of the back-cross lambs and their four F1 sires were genotyped with the OvineSNP50 Beadchip (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA). Quality control of the SNPs included the following tests: (1) 50 animals were genotyped twice in order to assess the technical reliability of the genotyping  which resulted in a value of 99.9%  (2) individuals with a call rate below 98% and SNPs with a call rate below 97% or with a minor allele frequency below 1% or featuring a deviation from expected heterozygosity or showing mendelian inconsistencies were discarded (p<U+2009><<U+2009>10) and (3) quality control of the genotypes resulted in 42 469 SNPs that comply with all quality checks. More details about the genomic information can be found in Sallé et al. []. Phenotypes on growth traits and parasite resistance traits were collected on the BC animals only by performing the following experimental protocol. The lambs were weaned around 64 or 45 days  depending whether their mother was either primiparous or not  and grew in a  free environment until the first experimental infestation was performed. During this period the animals were kept in an  free environment and were weighed twice: at weaning and at the end of the growing period. The growing period ended with the beginning of the following experimental infestation protocol  which also determined when the environment was to be contaminated with  larvae: at around 90 days of age  the lambs received an oral inoculation of 10 000 L3 larvae of  (ENVT strain []) and around 41 days after the infestation  they received an anthelmintic treatment (LEVAMISOLE 5%  Vibrac S.A.  Carros  France  7.5 mg/kg live weight). During the infestation  two faecal samples were collected  at 25 and 35 days after infestation  and the animals were weighed on the day of treatment. Then  they entered a recovery period of 8 days  at the end of which they were infested again with the same infestation protocol. During the second infestation  two faecal samples were collected as before but animals were not weighed. During the whole protocol  the animals were fed ad libitum on a diet that covered largely their requirements. The faecal egg count in each sample was measured by a modified McMaster procedure []. The average of the two faecal egg count observations was computed for each infestation. The latter values were transformed by taking their fourth root in order to bring their distribution closer to normality. A further transformation was applied in order to scale the standard deviation to 1 and avoid zero values. The variables obtained were called: FEC1 (transformed faecal egg counts during the first infestation) and FEC2 (transformed faecal egg counts during the second infestation). The average daily gain from weaning to infestation (ADG0) and average daily gain during the first infestation (ADG1) were computed as follows:   where  and  are the weight gain and the days running from the weaning day to the day of beginning of the first infestation  respectively;  and  are the weight gain and the days running from the first day of the first infestation to the day of treatment of the first infestation  respectively. A transformation for scaling the standard deviation to 1 and avoiding 0 s was applied on growth traits as well. The observations outside a range of 2.96 standard deviations around the average of each trait were considered atypical and excluded from the analysis. Finally  only the animals featuring a valid observation both on genotyping and on at least one trait were included in the analysis  which resulted in 40 animals being discarded and 1004 animals being included. Estimation of the genetic parameters was performed by considering the back-cross population as a single breed population. The breed proportions are taken into account by the genetic relationship matrix in the model including SNP information but could not be taken into account in the model including pedigree information only due to convergence failure. The heritability of each trait and both the genetic correlation and phenotypic correlation between each pair of traits were estimated by bivariate animal mixed models  which were solved by the AIREML procedure implemented in AIRemlF90 software []. This software features by default the correction for the change in the definition of the base population so that the estimates obtained when using pedigree information only were comparable to those obtained when including molecular information [  ]. The bivariate mixed model reads as follows: where  and  are the vectors of observations of trait one and two  respectively   and  are incidence matrices relating each observation to its respective set of fixed effects and  and  are the vectors of the fixed effects: weight at weaning (for ADG0 only) or weight at first infestation (for all the other traits)  contemporary group (identified by year  season  weighting lot and infestation lot)  sex and feeding mode (breast feeding or bottle feeding).  and  are the vectors of random animals breeding values  with the associated incidence matrices  and .  and  are the vectors of random residuals. It is assumed that the random effects are normally distributed and feature the following variance-covariance structure: where  are the genetic variances and the genetic covariance between traits 1 and 2   are the residuals variances and the residuals covariance between traits 1 and 2   is an identity matrix and  is the genetic relationship matrix between the animals. The genetic and phenotypic correlations between each couple of traits were computed using two different genetic relationship matrices: one computed by using pedigree information only (PED model) and one computed by including both SNP and pedigree information jointly (SNPED model). The  matrix used in the PED model was computed according to Quaas [] and without using molecular information. The  matrix used in the SNPED model was computed according to VanRaden []  using a three-generation deep pedigree and the following weights: <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95<U+2009>+<U+2009>0.05  where  is the relationship matrix between the genotyped animals computed by using the pedigree information only [] and  is the genomic relationship matrix among genotyped animals. In the software package used for this study []  the  matrix is computed by default as follows: <U+2009>=<U+2009>  [] where  is a rectangular matrix (number of animals by number of SNPs’ alleles) with elements: <U+2009>=<U+2009><U+2009>-<U+2009>2p  where  is a scalar equal to the number of copies of one allele an animal i has at locus j  p is the frequency of allele j in the population   is the diagonal matrix of the scaling parameters with elements: K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2<U+2009><U+2211><U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>). The weights of  and are used for bending the genetic relationship matrix and make it positive definite  as required for its inversion []  this is similar to the bending procedure occurring in AIREML algorithms for keeping the variance covariance matrix positive definite []. The precision of the heritability and correlation estimates was computed by estimating their standard error according to the following formulas []: where  is the standard error of the estimate of the heritability of trait i   and  are the estimates of its genetic and phenotypic variances  respectively     and  are the variances of the estimated values and the covariance between the estimated values  respectively  obtained from the information matrix []: where () is the standard error of the estimate of the genetic correlation   is the estimated value of the genetic correlation; are  the estimates of the genetic variance components described above and V(.) and C(..) are the variance of the estimates between parenthesis and the covariance between the estimates between parenthesis  respectively. The same formula was used to compute the standard error of the phenotypic correlation  but by filling in the entries concerning phenotypic variances and covariances. The parameters under study are the ratio of two normally distributed variables (heritability) and the ratio between a gaussian variable over the square root of the product of two gaussian variables (correlations). The sampling distribution of heritability can be approximated to a gaussian distribution under certain specific conditions only []. When these conditions are filled  the significance test for gaussian variables can be applied. However  the significance tests for the correlation coefficient can be developed by deriving its confidence interval according to Fisher's Z-transformation []. Otherwise  both parameters can be tested by using a re-sampling procedure such as delete-d jackknife: where d is the number of observations randomly discarded from the dataset and n<U+2009><<U+2009>d<U+2009><<U+2009>n (n is the total number of observations in the dataset) []. One thousand sub-samples of the whole dataset were created by randomly discarding 20% of the observations. Each parameter computed above was re-estimated from each sub-sample in order to build its empirical distribution. The empirical distribution of each parameter was used to compute the confidence interval of each parameter by taking its 2.5% quantile as the lower bound and its 97.5% quantile as the upper bound of each estimate. The null hypothesis “the estimate is not different from 0” was tested as follows: if the confidence interval of the estimate included 0  then the null hypothesis was not rejected  otherwise the alternative hypothesis “the estimate is different from 0” was accepted. In order to test whether the SNPED and SNP models converged to the same estimate  the distribution of the difference between the PED and SNPED estimates was built for each estimate as follows: where  is the vector containing the n realizations of the estimate obtained from the PED model   is the vector containing the n realizations of the estimate obtained from the SNPED model   the vector of the differences between and each element of  and . The confidence interval of the distribution of the difference was computed as above. The null hypothesis “the difference between the estimate obtained from the PED model and the estimate obtained from the SNPED model is 0” was tested against the alternative hypothesis “the difference between the estimate obtained from the PED model and the estimate obtained from the SNPED model is not 0” as above as well. Table  shows the summary statistics of the variables analysed. The transformations applied to the raw faecal egg counts resulted in the profile of their distribution being closer to normality. The skewness and normalized kurtosis of FEC1 changed from 2.11 to -0.44 and from 6.56 to 0.53  respectively; the skewness and normalized kurtosis of FEC2 changed from 3.87 to 0.14 and from 23.92 to -0.74  respectively. The number of observations on each trait together with the average  standard deviation  minimum and maximum of the raw observations are in Table . ADG1 was significantly lower than ADG0 (p_value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  indicating that infested animals had a slower growth than the parasite-free animals  as expected due to the infestation []. Table  shows the estimate of the phenotypic correlations (below the diagonal) obtained from the two models for each pair of traits. Although the SNPED and PED models did not always converge on the same value  according to the significance tests described above  these estimates were not significantly different between the two models. The estimates of the phenotypic correlations between ADG0 and both FEC1 and FEC2 were not significantly different from 0: -0.01 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.15) and 0.01 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.18) for the PED model and 0.02 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) and 0.04 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) for the SNPED model. These results suggest that the phenotype for growth rate in a  free environment was unrelated to the parasite resistance phenotype. However  the estimates of both the phenotypic correlations between ADG1 and FEC1 and between ADG1 and FEC2 were negative: -0.24 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.15) and -0.20 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.19) for the PED model and -0.23 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) and -0.19 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.11) for the SNPED model. These results suggest an inverse proportionality between the growth rate and the parasite burden  in accordance with the finding that contaminated animals had a slower growth than non-contaminated animals. The average faecal egg count during the second infestation was significantly lower than the faecal egg count during the first infestation (p_value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001)  which suggests that the development of a specific immune response was triggered by the first infestation  that enhanced the intrinsic resistance of the animals to subsequent infestations []. Furthermore  the positive estimate of the phenotypic correlation between FEC1 and FEC2  0.46 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.43) for the PED model and 0.62 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20) for the SNPED model  shows that the animals featuring higher (or lower) than average FEC1 are likely to express higher (or lower) than average FEC2  and vice versa. This suggests that a repeatable variation in susceptibility occurs within the population. Table  summarizes the estimates of the heritabilities of each trait (block diagonal) and the estimates of the genetic correlations (above the diagonal) between each pair of traits obtained with the PED and SNPED models  together with the standard error of each estimate (between brackets). Due to the pedigree structure that includes only four sires  both the standard errors and the 95% confidence intervals of the estimates were indeed large (in particular  those of the PED model)  which led to no significant difference between the estimates obtained from the two models. The results obtained were in general coherent between models  except for the genetic correlation between ADG0 and FEC1  which was positive with the SNPED model and negative with the PED model. However  the latter estimate had a standard error as large as half the parameter space  which resulted in the confidence of the difference between the two estimates to include 0. The reason for this possible inconsistency cannot be defined by the data available for this study. We can only speculate that it could be the result of the segregation variance captured by the SNP chip  because the phenotypes analysed were collected on the back-cross offspring of only four sires. This pedigree structure is indeed poorly informative if the estimate is computed by using pedigree information only  which is clearly shown by the huge standard error obtained with the PED model. However  this does not explain why such a big difference in the estimates occurs between some pairs of traits only. The heritability of ADG0 was low for both models  0.10 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.08) for the PED model and 0.15 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.07) for the SNPED model  and is close to the value 0.17 found in the review of Safari et al. []. The heritability of ADG1 was low as well  0.16 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) and 0.11 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06) for the PED and the SNPED model respectively and no estimates were found in the literature for ADG1. The estimates for the heritabilities of both faecal egg counts were found higher than those obtained in previous studies [–]: FEC1 was 0.21 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06) and 0.38 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) for the PED and the SNPED model  respectively; FEC2 was 0.55 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.09) and 0.48 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06) for the PED and the SNPED model  respectively. The reason for finding a higher value than in previous studies could be twofold. First  it could be due to the fact that most of the estimates found in the literature are computed from observations in natural rather than experimental conditions  the latter of which allows controlling more strictly the environmental conditions and hence could reduce phenotypic variation. The second reason could be the occurrence of breed specific alleles that segregate within the back-cross population  which inflate the genetic variance compared to a pure breed population. These values confirm the availability of a moderate genetic potential in sheep that could be exploited to enhance resistance to parasites. Concerning previous estimates of the genetic correlation between growth traits and faecal egg counts  no other estimations of these parameters based on experimental infestation were found in the literature. Furthermore  previous studies on similar traits based on natural infestations do not show consistency among them [–]  which could be explained by the uncontrolled variation in the larval challenge  in the pathogenicity of the parasite in each population  in the feed intake and the interaction between these three factors []. Concerning the genetic correlations between growth traits (ADG0 and ADG1) and parasite resistance during the naïve infestation (FEC1)  the following picture can be drawn. In accordance with the estimates of the phenotypic correlation between ADG0 and FEC1  the genetic correlations between these traits were also not significantly different from 0: -0.52 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.06) for the PED model and 0.11 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.47) for the SNPED model. The same results were obtained with the estimate of the genetic correlations between ADG1 and FEC1 (although their phenotypic correlations were negative according to both models): -0.19 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.80) for the PED model and -0.12 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.58) for the SNPED model. These results suggest that during the naïve infestation  the genotype for growth (ADG0 and ADG1) could be expressed independently from the genotype for parasite resistance (FEC1). The results obtained for the genetic correlations between growth traits and the long-term resistance (FEC2) were on the contrary significantly different from 0. On the one hand  the genetic correlation between ADG0 and FEC2 was positive but not significantly different from 0 according to the PED model (0.25  SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.85) and positive (0.57  SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.38) according to the SNPED model. According to the approximate standard errors  the positive estimate obtained with the SNPED model is more reliable and suggests that if animals were selected for growth in a parasite-free environment  a correlated selection response for lower long-term resistance to gastrointestinal parasites could occur as well. This estimate supports the hypothesis that enhancing growth traits could come to a cost to the sheep's long-term susceptibility to parasite infestations  and vice versa [  ]. On the other hand  the correlation between ADG1 and FEC2 was consistently negative between models: -0.48 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.67) for the PED model and -0.54 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.53) for the SNPED model  which suggests that growth during the naïve infestation can be enhanced together with long-term resistance to the infestation within a single purebred line. The genetic correlation between FEC1 and FEC2 was 0.46 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.43) and 0.62 (SE<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.20) for the PED and SNPED models  respectively  which suggests that these traits have different determinisms. While FEC1 represents a measure of the parasite resistance expressed by a naïve lamb  FEC2 is a measure of the parasite resistance expressed by an immunized lamb  and indeed the mechanisms by which these types of animals respond to the infestation are different []. The estimate of genetic correlation between ADG0 and ADG1 was unstable due to its sensitivity to the starting values used for its estimation and is not reported. Table  shows both the ratio of the standard errors of the estimates obtained from the PED model over the standards error obtained from the SNPED model  which ranged from 1.04 to 2.25 and also the ratio between the width of the confidence intervals of the estimates obtained from the PED model over the width of the confidence intervals obtained from the SNPED model  which spanned an interval between 0.93 and 4.21. According to the ratio of the standard errors  the SNPED model always converged to more precise values  while  according to the ratio of the width of the confidence intervals  the estimate of the phenotypic correlation between growth traits and FEC1 obtained from the PED model was slightly more precise. The results obtained show that including SNP information in the computation of the relationship matrix between individuals can increase the precision of the genetic parameter estimates up to twice the precision obtained by using pedigree information only []. The increase in precision can be explained by the fact that SNP information allows to compute more precisely than pedigree information what proportion of genome two individuals actually have in common. The pedigree structure in the data available for this study was not ideal to estimate genetic parameters by pedigree information only because all observations are recorded on a population of animals composed of four groups of half-sibs. Such a structure causes the pedigree-based relationship matrix to predict that within each group of half-sibs all animals share one quarter of the sire’s genome. Whereas  the marker-based relationship matrix allows capturing the segregation variance  which means capturing the random deviation of the proportion of genes shared by two individuals around the expected proportion of shared genes according to the pedigree []. According to the results obtained by the model including both pedigree and molecular information  the genotypes for growth and for resistance to naïve infestation can be selected for independently. However  the genetic correlations between long-term parasite resistance traits and growth traits were different from 0 and suggest that increasing growth performance in a  free environment could result in more susceptible animals  whereas growth performance in a contaminated environment can be increased while enhancing long-term resistance to . The two results taken together can also be interpreted as an indication of genotype by environment interaction affecting growth expressed across the two environments []. The model that includes pedigree information only converged to similar results  except for the genetic correlation between growth before infestation and faecal egg count during the first infestation which was affected by a very large standard error. The reason for this inconsistency needs further investigation. This study shows that  when the pedigree is poorly informative using molecular information and pedigree information jointly result in more precise genetic parameters than using pedigree only.

Of the 64 432 SNPs on the chip  44 412 were used for GWAS with an animal mixed model that included a regression coefficient for the tested SNPs and a genomic kinship matrix. SNP haplotype effects in QTL regions were then tested for association with phenotypes following phase reconstruction based on the Sscrofa10.2 pig genome assembly.ResultsTwenty-three QTL regions were identified on autosomes and their effects ranged from 0.25 to 0.75 phenotypic standard deviation units for feed intake and feed efficiency (four QTL)  carcass (12 QTL) and meat quality traits (seven QTL). The 10 most significant QTL regions had effects on carcass (chromosomes 7  10  16  17 and 18) and meat quality traits (two regions on chromosome 1 and one region on chromosomes 8  9 and 13). Thirteen of the 23 QTL regions had not been previously described. A haplotype block of 183 kb on chromosome 1 (six SNPs) was identified and displayed three distinct haplotypes with significant (0.0001<U+2009><<U+2009>P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.03) associations with all evaluated meat quality traits.ConclusionsGWAS analyses with the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip enabled the detection of 23 QTL regions that affect feed consumption  carcass and meat quality traits in a LW population  of which 13 were novel QTL.

GWAS analyses with the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip enabled the detection of 23 QTL regions that affect feed consumption  carcass and meat quality traits in a LW population  of which 13 were novel QTL. The proportionally larger number of QTL found for meat quality traits suggests a specific opportunity for improving these traits in the pig by genomic selection. Over the past 20 years  several whole-genome scans using mainly microsatellite markers have revealed quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a large number of traits in pigs. To date  a total of some 8300 QTL for more than 600 overlapping phenotypic traits have been reported in the PigQTLdb (  March 21  2013; []). However  because of the low density of microsatellite markers  these QTL are generally located with poor accuracy and additional long-term fine-mapping experiments are necessary to refine their positions and determine causative variants (e.g. [  ]). Moreover  QTL linkage designs have in most cases been based on a limited number of families from crosses between divergent populations []  resulting in limited mapping accuracy and QTL results that are not directly transferable to commercial populations. The high-throughput genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has become available for pigs with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip []. The dense genome coverage provided by this chip makes it possible to exploit the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and QTL through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS have been shown to be more powerful for accurate QTL mapping than linkage-based methods (see for example [] in livestock). Since the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip has become available  several GWAS have been performed in commercial pig populations and have revealed significant associations for economically important traits such as boar taint []  reproductive characteristics []  body composition []  pathogen susceptibility []  hematological traits []  feed efficiency [  ]  and meat quality []. GWAS have also been performed in a Large White × Minzhu inter-cross population for meat quality [] and hematological traits []. However  to date results on dense GWAS are not available for other major traits in commercial pig populations such as growth rate. The objective of this work was to perform a high-density genome-wide association study with the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip in the French Large White (LW) breed in order to map the genomic regions that are associated with growth efficiency  carcass and meat quality traits  and to identify haplotypes that may be suitable for inclusion in selection strategies. The animals involved in this study were reared and slaughtered in compliance with national regulations applicable to animal research and commercial slaughtering. A total of 385 French LW castrated male pigs from 29 LW nucleus herds were performance-tested at the French national test station in Le Rheu (UETP  Le Rheu  Ille et Vilaine  France). Pigs descended from 106 sires and 313 dams and originated from 335 litters. The piglets entered UETP at 4 to 6 weeks of age and were placed in group pens in a post-weaning unit until they were 10 weeks old. They were then transferred to a fattening unit and placed in group pens for 12 animals equipped with Acema 64 single-place electronic feeders (Acemo  Pontivy  France). All pigs were weighed at the beginning (around 35 kg live weight) and end (around 110 kg live weight) of the performance test. During the test period  they were fed  with pellets composed of cereals and soybean meal containing 9.5 MJ net energy and 156 g crude protein per kg  with a minimum of 0.87 g digestible lysine per MJ of net energy. The average daily gain (ADG)  daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) during the test period were calculated using individual weight measurements and data collected from the electronic feeders. Residual feed intake (RFI) was computed as the difference between DFI and a “theoretical” feed intake predicted from maintenance and production requirements using a phenotypic multiple linear regression method  as described in []. When pigs reached 110 kg live weight  they were fasted for a minimum of 16 hours and then transported for about 35 minutes to be slaughtered in a commercial abattoir (Cooperl  Montfort-sur-Meu). Carcass weight and length were measured shortly after slaughter. Carcass length (CL) was determined from the atlas to the anterior edge of the pubian symphysis. Average carcass backfat thickness (CBF) was computed as the mean of carcass fat depths at the shoulder  the last rib  and the hip joint. Carcasses with head and feet but without kidney fat were then chilled in a cooling room at 4°C for 24 hours. Dressing percentage (DP) was defined as the ratio of cold carcass weight to slaughter weight measured after the fasting period prior to transportation. The day after slaughter  the right half-carcass (RHC) (without head) was weighed and then cut based on a standardized procedure []. The ham  loin  belly  shoulder and backfat were weighed separately (HAM  LOIN  BELLY  SHOULDER and BACKFAT  respectively). Lean meat content was then estimated using the cut weights as ELMC (%)<U+2009>=<U+2009>25.08 – (1.23 × (100 × BACKFAT/RHC))<U+2009>+<U+2009>(0.87 × (100 × LOIN/RHC))<U+2009>+<U+2009>(0.73 × (100 × (100 × HAM/RHC)) []. Several meat quality traits were recorded on the day after slaughter. Ultimate pH was measured on the  (pH24 SM) muscle at 4°C using a Knick Portaness 910 pH meter (Knick GmbH & Co.  Berlin  Germany) equipped with a Mettler Toledo Probe (Mettler-Toledo International Inc.  Urdorf  Switzerland). Meat color was assessed on the  (GS) muscle using the three coordinates  L*  a* and b*  of the CIELAB color space with a Minolta CR-300 chromameter (Konica Minolta  Tokyo  Japan) under the D65 illuminant option and an 11-mm orifice (L*GS  a*GS and b*GS). Under this system  L* indicates how light the meat color is (a lower value being associated with darker meat) while a* represents the degree of green-redness (redder meat for a higher a* value) and b* reflects the degree of blue-yellowness of the meat (yellower meat for a greater b* value). The water holding capacity (WHC) of GS was measured as the time necessary for a piece of filter paper (about 1 cm) to become wet when placed on the freshly cut surface of the muscle []  a higher value being associated with a lower ability to lose water (1 point<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 s; maximum 20 points). A meat quality index (MQI) was computed as a linear combination of pH24 SM  WHC GS and L* GS: MQI (%)<U+2009>=<U+2009>34<U+2009>+<U+2009>(11.04 × pH24 SM)<U+2009>+<U+2009>(0.105 × WHC GS) – (0.231 × L* GS). This equation has been defined as a predictor of technological yield (ratio of the weight of cooked ham to the weight of defatted and boneless fresh ham) during cured-cooked ham processing []. Blood was sampled from the test pigs at a live weight of about 60 kg. The DNA was extracted from blood samples of 491 animals (385 piglets and their 106 sires) and genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (San Diego  CA  USA) containing 62 163 SNPs [] at the Centre National de Génotypage (Evry  France). The order of the SNPs was based on the Pig Sscrofa10.2 assembly released by the International Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium []  combined with RH mapping information []. Quality control was done considering genotyping of the 106 sires that were more representative of the LW population. The  function of the GenABEL R package [] was applied. It excluded 5390 SNPs with call rates lower than 97%  12 077 SNPs with minor allele frequencies less than 5%  and 1051 SNPs with a -value of a  test for a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium lower than 1.10. After applying these quality control measures  42 272 SNPs located on autosomes and 2140 SNPs that were not located on the Pig Sscrofa 10.2 assembly were retained for association analyses  i.e. an average of 15 SNPs per Mb. After filtering  the number of SNPs per chromosome ranged from 1047 (SSC18 i.e.  chromosome 18) to 5155 (SSC1). The call rate across the retained SNPs was higher than 90% for all animals and so all animals were retained for analyses. Prior to GWAS  the phenotypes of the 385 LW animals were analyzed jointly with the phenotypes of their batch mates (3030 animals from five breeds) to adjust the data for systematic environmental effects. All traits were corrected using a linear model (GLM procedure  SAS Inst.  Inc.  Cary  NC [])  which included the fixed effects of breed (five levels)  the combination of test year  test station and contemporary group (slaughter date for meat quality traits or fattening batch for other traits; 20 and 97 levels  respectively) and body weight of the animal at the start of the test (for traits recorded during growth) or at slaughter (for traits recorded at the abattoir)  nested within breed  as a linear covariate. The residuals from these analyses were then used as trait phenotypes for GWAS. The GWAS were performed using the GenABEL R package []. For each trait  SNP effects were tested with the FASTA (FAmily-based Score Test for Association) method [] based on a mixed animal model (1) that included the genomic kinship matrix  ( procedure in GenABEL) to account for relatedness in the sampled population: with <U+2009>=<U+2009>the phenotype corrected for systematic environmental effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the overall mean; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the genotype score (0  1 or 2) of the  SNP for the  individual; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the additive effect of the  SNP; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the random polygenic effect of the  individual  with covariance structure   where  is the genomic kinship matrix and  is the polygenic variance; and <U+2009>=<U+2009>the random residual effect with   where  is an identity matrix and  is the residual variance. As a first step  the variance components  and  were estimated using the genomic kinship matrix in an animal mixed model without a marker effect. These variance components were used in a second step to jointly estimate all the effects included in model (1). To avoid inflation in the test statistic due to potential deviations from its assumptions  the consistency with  tests for the distribution of the -values was controlled by regressing the observed -values of each GWAS against the expected -values of a  test. The -values were then corrected by multiplying observed -values by the regression factor <U+03BB>  using the genomic control method []. This correction assumes that the number of SNPs with an effect on the trait is very small compared to the total number of SNPs tested. As proposed in Teyssèdre et al. []  three -value thresholds were used to identify and describe regions of interest. The most stringent threshold was 5.10  which corresponds to approximately 10 000 independent tests corrected with Bonferroni. A less stringent threshold of 5.10 was also applied to detect moderate associations  as proposed by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium []. Finally  in order to take into account effects of QTL on correlated traits  SNPs with a -value threshold of 5.10 that were located in the vicinity of the QTL regions were also reported. A QTL region was considered by grouping SNPs with -values lower than 5.10 in a 10 Mb interval. Haplotypes transmitted by a parent to each of its offspring were inferred based on informative SNPs  using a similar procedure to that of Coop et al. [] and described in Tortereau et al. []. Briefly  the haplotype reconstruction procedure is based on three steps. First  within each half-sib family  a partial haplotype phase was reconstructed for the father based on the genotypes of the offspring. This was done by first partially reconstructing the haplotype transmitted by the father based on markers that are homozygous in the offspring. Then  paternally transmitted haplotypes of all offspring were combined to reconstruct the haplotypes of the father and the haplotype transmitted to each offspring by its mother. Second  the model of Scheet and Stephens [] was fitted to the partial haplotypes of fathers and mothers across families to increase the level of haplotype reconstruction. Finally  given the phase information in the fathers and for each offspring  segregation indicators that describe which of the paternal alleles was transmitted at each SNP  were reconstructed. In regions that contained at least one SNP with significant effects on a trait (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.10)  the LD between SNPs was calculated as   using Haploview (V4.2; []). LD blocks were generated for SNPs that were separated by less than 500 kb  as proposed by Gabriel et al. []. In regions that contained at most 10 SNPs  the haplotypes of the progeny were inferred from their genotypes and phased genotypes of their parents and additional haplotype analyses were performed using the following multiple regression mixed model for each region: where <U+2009>=<U+2009>the phenotype corrected for systematic environmental effects; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the overall mean; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the haplotype score (0  1 or 2) of the  haplotype for the  individual  with <U+2009>=<U+2009>the number of haplotypes segregating in the population for that region; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the effect of the  haplotype; <U+2009>=<U+2009>the random sire effect and <U+2009>=<U+2009>the random residual effect. Model (2) was tested using the Mixed procedure of the SAS software (SAS Inst.  Inc.  Cary  NC []). The overall effect of the haplotypes in a region and contrasts between two haplotype effects were tested using the CONTRAST and ESTIMATE functions  respectively. For the 19 traits analyzed  the number of records  means and standard deviations are in Table . Phenotypic correlations between traits corrected for systematic environmental effects are in Figure .   <U+2009>Correlations were estimated on phenotypes adjusted for systematic environmental traits and negative and positive correlations are represented in blue and red  respectively. After checking that no structure was present in our population by applying multidimensional scaling available in the GenABEL R package []  GWAS analyses were performed for the 19 traits. The average inflation factor of -values was 1.11<U+2009>±<U+2009>0.12  with a minimum of 1 (for five of the 19 traits) and a maximum of 1.39 (for BACKFAT)  indicating relatively good concordance between the observed and assumed distributions of the test statistics. Seventeen trait × SNP tests  involving 16 distinct SNPs  were significant at the threshold of 5.10 and 52 tests  involving 48 distinct SNPs  were significant at the threshold of 5.10. Only two of these SNPs were not located on the Pig Sscrofa10.2 draft. In total  23 QTL regions were identified  including all autosomes except SSC2  5 and 12 (Figure ). At least one QTL region was identified for each trait  except ADG  DFI  SHOULDER and WHC. The magnitude of the estimated SNP effects was expressed in trait phenotypic standard deviation (STD) units  which was calculated based on phenotypes adjusted for systematic environmental effects (Table ).   <U+2009>The letters distinguish different QTL regions on the same chromosome; when at least one SNP in the region was significant at the threshold of 5.10  names of the QTL regions are in bold (see Table ). Ten QTL regions were identified at the most stringent threshold (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.10)  i.e. five for carcass traits  five for meat quality traits and none for growth rate  feed intake and feed efficiency. Two of the five carcass QTL  on SSC7 and SSC17  had an effect on carcass length (from 0.28 to 0.42 STD) only. The three other carcass QTL  on SSC10  16 and 18  affected carcass cut weight and backfat thickness (0.27 - 0.45 STD). The five QTL for meat quality traits were located on SSC1 (two QTL)  SSC8  9 and 13. Each of these QTL affected several meat quality traits  with effects ranging from 0.27 to 0.75 STD. Most of the detected QTL regions were composed of a single SNP that was significant at the 5.10 threshold  except for the QTL region on SSC17 for CL (three SNPs)  and on SSC1d (four SNP) and SSC9a (two SNP) for meat quality traits. However  for each of the 10 most significant QTL regions  other trait × SNP combinations were found at the 5.10 and 5.10 thresholds. Based on the moderate threshold (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.10)  13 additional QTL regions were identified. Three QTL  on SSC3  SSC11 and SSC18  had effects of about 0.30 STD on FCR  and one QTL on SSC6 had effects ranging from 0.41 to 0.46 STD for RFI. Seven QTL with effects on different carcass composition traits (0.25 – 0.59 STD) were detected on SSC1  3  6  9  14  15 and 16. For meat quality traits  two additional QTL regions (on SSC1b and SSC4) were identified  with moderate effects (0.27 - 0.38) on meat color and ultimate pH. Relative to the number of traits analyzed  a larger number of tests with a -value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.10 was obtained for meat quality traits (on average 3.5 significant tests per trait) than for growth rate and feed intake (1.5 significant tests per trait) and for carcass traits (2.8 significant tests per trait). With the criteria that were used to define QTL regions  no QTL region was shown to simultaneously affect different groups of traits (growth  feed intake and feed efficiency  carcass and meat quality traits). However  within meat quality traits for example  some peaks tended to be shared  as for pH24 SM and MQI on SSC8  or for b* GS and L* GS on SSC1 (Figure ).   <U+2009>See Table  for meat quality trait abbreviations; 42 272 SNPs located on autosomes 1 to 18  and 2140 SNPs that are not located (chromosome noted 0) on the <U+2009>build 10.2 represented by different colors; dotted  dashed and solid lines correspond to thresholds of 5.10  5.10<U+2009>and 5.10  respectively. The 10 most significant QTL regions were subjected to haplotype analyses. First  SNPs that had significant effects at the threshold of 5.10 and that were in high LD within a QTL region were grouped together in haplotype blocks according to the criteria specified by Gabriel et al. []. Using these criteria  a haplotype block could be identified for only one of the QTL regions   the 183 kb SSC1d region  with six SNPs that were associated with meat quality traits (Table ). The  between SNPs in this region ranged from 0.30 to 1 (Figure a).  . A black diamond without a number represents complete linkage disequilibrium between the SNP (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>1). . Parental frequencies of each haplotype containing the six significant SNPs. Three distinct haplotypes (ACTCTA  ACTTTC and GTCTCC  referred to as Haplo1  Haplo2 and Haplo3 hereinafter) were identified in the SSC1d region with frequencies of 57%  24% and 19%  respectively (Figure b). Their effects on the 19 traits were evaluated for the 376 phased progeny in order to evaluate potential pleiotropic effects of the region. Parental phases were unavailable for nine animals  which were discarded from the haplotype analysis. The haplotypes had significant (0.0001<U+2009><<U+2009>-value<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) effects on all six meat quality traits analyzed (Table ). The highest significance levels were obtained for b*GS and L*GS and for the meat quality index (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>1.10)   the traits that displayed significant results in the GWAS (Table ). For these three traits and for pH24 SM  Haplo1 and Haplo3 showed significant and opposite effects. Haplo1 was associated with favorable effects (e.g. for MQI: +0.5 point for Haplo1 vs -0.6 for Haplo3). Haplo2 had effects that were similar to Haplo1 for b*GS and L*GS  but had no significant effect on MQI and pH24 SM. For the two other traits  Haplo1 was the only haplotype that had a significant effect on a*GS  while Haplo1 and Haplo2 had  respectively  favorable (+8 s) and unfavorable (-8 s) effects on WHC. As a consequence  Haplo1 had a consistently favorable effect on all meat quality traits recorded  and Haplo3 displayed an almost systematically opposite effect on these traits. The effects of Haplo2 were either intermediate or not significantly different from Haplo1. The PorcineSNP60 BeadChip has become available quite recently []. A GWAS method testing individual SNP effects was chosen because previous studies had demonstrated that single-marker tests produced similar or even greater power than haplotype-based approaches [  ]. Moreover  testing individual SNP effects does not depend on SNP positions and haplotype reconstruction. None of the detected QTL regions displayed significant effects on more than one group of traits  despite the presence of significant genetic correlations []  such as between growth rate and body composition. During preliminary simulation studies  the relatively limited size of the data set (about three half-sib progeny from about 100 sires) was shown to enable detection of only relatively large QTL (with effects greater than 0.5 STD) for traits with a heritability of 0.5  and power was less than 30% when the effect of the QTL or trait heritability was reduced []. With such limited power  it is therefore not surprising that only large QTL were detected  and that no region was identified to affect multiple traits with moderate genetic correlations. Nevertheless  a relatively large number of significant QTL was found for meat quality traits  although these traits are generally less heritable than growth  feed intake or carcass traits []. LD blocks were used to identify haplotypes associated with phenotypes in our study. Only one region could be dissected based on this approach  since the other regions displayed no LD blocks for the SNPs with significant effects. This small number of LD blocks might be due to the distance between SNPs with significant effects or to local inaccuracies in the published sequence or to the presence of limited LD between adjacent SNPs in our population. However  in QTL regions for which LD blocks were identified  it was possible to identify haplotypes that significantly affected the traits. Alignment of the genetic and physical maps on the most recent porcine genome sequence assembly (Sscrofa10.2) in PigQTLdB [] allowed our results to be compared with previously reported QTL locations. Ten of the QTL regions found in our study were consistent with QTL locations previously detected by linkage analyses. However  most of the QTL regions detected in our study (13 of the 23 QTL regions) were not previously described. In particular  none of the regions detected coincided with the QTL regions reported by Tribout et al. []  who used a grand-daughter design with microsatellite markers in the same population. The discrepancies between population structures  methods of analysis  and density and informativity of markers could explain the differences between the results of Tribout et al. [] and our study. Four QTL regions had a significant effect (-value<U+2009><<U+2009>5.10) on RFI (SSC6a) or FCR (SSC3a  11 and 18b). Markers flanking the SSC6a QTL region are located in the  gene ()  where a polymorphism has previously found to be associated with RFI in Yorkshire pigs []  but which was subsequently not reported as significantly associated with RFI in a GWAS in that same population []). Among the three QTL that affected FCR  two (SSC3a and SSC18b) were not previously reported in the literature. These two QTL regions were small (about 21 and 92 kb respectively) and they had an effect of about 1/3 STD on FCR. In the vicinity of the SSC11 region  a QTL for FCR was previously described in a F2 Meishan × Large White population []. Another recent GWAS for FCR in a Duroc population [] identified no common QTL regions with our LW pigs. Most earlier QTL linkage analyses included carcass traits and a very large number of QTL have been reported for these traits. Nevertheless  to our knowledge  eight of the 12 QTL regions found for carcass traits in our study were not previously described   on SSC1c (at 46 Mb)  SSC3b (at 110 Mb)  SSC6b (at 135 Mb)  SSC9b (at 116 Mb)  SSC10 (at 2 Mb)  SSC14 (at 139 Mb)  SSC15 (at 138 Mb) and SSC16a (at 34 Mb). Belly weight and carcass length displayed the largest number of significant associations (four distinct QTL regions for belly weight and three for carcass length). This might be because these two traits are not included in the French LW breeding objectives  so that QTL that affect these traits are less likely to have been fixed by selection than QTL for traits included in selection. In a purebred commercial population  our study confirmed the presence of four QTL that were previously detected in crossbred populations. Of these  a QTL on SSC7b that influences carcass length was previously described in several crossbred populations [–]. Liu et al. [] also reported a QTL with an effect on backfat thickness in the SSC16b region. The most significant association found in our study (-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>7.10)   the QTL on SSC17 (at 17 Mb) for carcass length  is located in a region where a QTL was previously described by Karlskov-Mortensen et al. [] in crossbred Hampshire and Landrace pigs. Finally  in the SSC18 QTL region (at 11 Mb)  a QTL was previously described in an F2 Berkshire × Yorkshire population []. These results show that several QTL that affect carcass traits with moderate to strong effects (from 0.3 to 0.6 STD) are still segregating in this LW population  despite more than 30 generations of selection for these traits. However  during the past two decades  this population has also been selected for reproductive traits  so that part of the selection pressure is applied to maternal abilities and prolificacy. This may explain why some QTL with relatively strong effects are still segregating in this population  either because selection pressure has not been sufficient to fix them  or because they exert antagonistic effects on production or reproduction traits. As a consequence  although the effects of our QTL must be confirmed in a larger population  estimates of their effects on reproductive traits are also required  in order to decipher how they can actually be used in the context of future marker-assisted selection strategies. Three of the seven QTL regions detected for meat quality traits were not previously described in the literature: the SSC1a region (at about 8–13 Mb)  the SSC9a region (at about 11 Mb) and the SSC13 region (24–29 Mb). The first two QTL regions have moderate effects on meat color traits (about 0.33 STD)  while the SSC13 QTL has an effect of 0.75 STD on meat lightness. Three QTL for meat quality traits were previously reported for the SSC1b  SSC4 and SSC8 regions by Ponsuksilii et al. [] and van Wijk et al. [] in crossbred populations  while the SSC1d QTL region has been shown to influence meat quality traits in Landrace pigs []. In the SSC1d region  a cluster of six SNPs was identified  and the three corresponding haplotypes had significant effects on all meat quality traits analyzed in our study  but not on other production traits. In this region of 183 kb  no functional candidate gene based on the present draft of the pig sequence could be identified. The 106 half-sib families in our study are representative of this LW population at the time of sampling  so that the estimated haplotype frequencies are expected to be close to those in the whole population. Assuming random mating  with the frequency of the favorable haplotype estimated at 57%  only 32% of the animals are expected to carry two copies of the most favorable haplotype. Thus  68% of the animals are carriers of at least one unfavorable haplotype and almost 4% of the pigs carry two copies of the most unfavorable haplotype. In addition  although meat quality traits had only moderate phenotypic correlations with growth or intake traits in our study  meat quality traits are known to have antagonistic relationships with feed efficiency traits []. Such antagonistic effects were  however  not found for these haplotypes or for any of the significant SNPs for meat quality and either FCR or RFI. The lack of adverse influences of the favorable haplotype on correlated production traits and on traits that were not evaluated in this study  such as reproduction traits  will therefore require specific tests and validation before the haplotype is used in selection. Finally  a survey of haplotypes that segregate in other commercial populations (Landrace  Piétrain  Duroc  etc.) and estimation of their effects on meat quality traits  might be necessary to identify the underlying causal polymorphisms. This study in a major French commercial pig population confirmed the segregation of several QTL affecting production and meat quality traits. Some of these QTL had not been reported before  while others were detected in crossbred populations using microsatellite markers. These findings demonstrate that using relatively dense SNP arrays within a purebred population makes it possible to detect QTL regions that were not detected by linkage analyses. Given the number of traits analyzed  the largest number of significant associations was obtained for meat quality traits. As selection has until recently tended to focus on growth or carcass traits rather than meat quality  genes with moderate to strong effects are more likely to be still segregating for these traits. However  our results also show that some QTL with moderate to strong effects on feed efficiency and carcass traits continue to segregate in this LW population. Moreover  the QTL detected did not affect multiple types of traits  which suggests that SNP could be used to improve growth  feed intake  feed efficiency and carcass traits without degrading meat quality traits and  reciprocally  to improve meat quality traits without affecting other production traits. This needs further validation to overcome the relatively limited power of our design.

The method is much faster and more accurate than other widely used population-based phasing programs. A program implementing the method is freely available as an R package (hsphase). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of genetic variation. With the advent of new molecular technologies and the sequencing of many important species  a considerable amount of these markers can now be genotyped cheaply and precisely on a routine basis  not only for humans but also for livestock. In animal breeding  these markers are now used to estimate breeding values for commercially important traits. Human genotypic data is usually sampled from a population of unrelated individuals or from trios  since the number of individuals in each family is small. However  in livestock populations  genotypes are often available from half-sib families. This data structure lends itself well to study the combinatorics that occurred during meiosis and allows identification of the recombination and segregation events that gave rise to the paternal haplotypes that are observed in the half-sib progeny. Once chromosomal segments () have been identified  they can be used to determine which progeny carry segments that are identical by descent (IBD)  to phase the genotypes of the progeny or to impute sire or progeny genotypes  depending on whether the parent or the progeny has sparser marker data. Generally  genotyping platforms do not provide phase information for the marker genotypes. Although advanced protocols have been developed that can generate phased genotype data directly  they are still too expensive for routine use in large-scale genotyping projects []. Instead  computational methods are used to infer the phase of marker genotypes. Phase information is important for association studies  where it can increase the power of the analyses. It can also provide valuable insights about the history of a population  be used to study signatures of selection  to estimate linkage disequilibrium  and to impute genotypes for genetic variants that have not been genotyped. Various approaches have been developed to reconstruct haplotypes from genotype data and several phasing algorithms have been proposed [–]. Hickey et al. []  in their AlphaPhase software  use the long-range phasing (LRP) method proposed by Kong et al. []  combined with a haplotype library imputation method. If available  AlphaPhase uses pedigree information to partition surrogate parents into paternal and maternal surrogates. BEAGLE [] and SHAPE-IT [] use haplotype frequencies in addition to identity by descent (IBD) probabilities []. Windig et al. [] use minimization of recombinations and all progeny information to phase the haplotypes. Li et al. [] and Dajun et al. [] phase haplotypes based on recombination minimization. Favier et al. [] and Boettcher et al. [] proposed a haplotype reconstruction method within half-sib families using a Monte Carlo approach and the likelihood of recombinations  respectively. The disjoint-set-structure (DSS) algorithm used in PedPhase 3 [] is an effective algorithm that improves on the Integer Linear Programming approaches used in PedPhase 2 [] and MERLIN [] to reconstruct haplotype utilising pedigree information. Druet and Georges [] proposed a heuristic method based on hidden Markov models that uses both population and family information to phase and cluster haplotypes. Another approach was suggested by Van Raden et al. []  which partitions the chromosome into segments and phases marker loci for which an individual is heterozygous using information from homozygous loci. An extensive review of phasing strategies is given in Browning and Browning []. Different methods for haplotype reconstruction have different strengths and weaknesses. Currently  many widely adopted methods of phasing such as BEAGLE and SHAPE-IT make use of population-wide genotype data. For these methods  the accuracy of phasing is largely related to the number of samples  marker density  allele frequencies  population structure and quality of genotypes []. In livestock  family sizes are usually larger than in human populations and allele frequency distributions may be skewed by overrepresentation of some widely used individuals. Genotypic data on its own may not be sufficient to accurately reconstruct haplotypes and this is particularly true when the number of samples is limited. Pedigree information can then be used to increase phasing accuracy []. In addition  computing times and reliability of phasing results are important criteria for practical use [] and will become even more so since the density of markers is rapidly increasing and routine use of full sequence data lies in the near future. The aim of this study was to propose and evaluate a fast algorithm designed to identify recombination events in the sire of a half-sib family using SNP marker genotypes. This information can be used to identify recombination events. Here  we assume that genotypes are available on a group of paternal half-sibs  and the genotype of the sire is not required. The algorithm identifies which chromosomal segments each half-sib inherited from the paternal and maternal strands of the sire. This information is then used to impute the sire’s genotype  which can be useful in case the sire is not genotyped or if it is genotyped at a lower marker density  and to phase the genotypes of the half-sib progeny. Alternatively  if haplotyped sequence data is available for the sire  this method can be used to impute the paternal sequence in the haplotype that each offspring inherited  provided that the offspring is genotyped. Although restricted to half-sib data structures  this approach allows phasing of very small datasets (small single families) and can also be used to identify the location of recombination events or as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the accuracy of other haplotyping methods. A program () that implements the method is freely available as an R package. The following sections describe the method  results with simulated and real datasets and compare its phasing accuracy to several other methods that are frequently used for phasing. Broadly  the method is based on exploiting the information content of opposing homozygous SNP marker genotypes and the linkage disequilibrium found within a half-sib family. Opposing homozygotes are markers for which one individual is homozygous for one allelic variant and another individual is homozygous for the other variant (here only bi-allelic variants are considered but the method can be extended to accommodate multi-allelic variants). First  all markers that have opposing homozygotes within a half-sib family are identified. At these markers  the paternal alleles are unambiguously identified and used to sort individuals into groups according to the paternal allele they received. The grouping of offspring at consecutive markers provides information about the most likely phase in the sire. We can then identify blocks of consecutive markers that were inherited together from the sire. This allows detection of likely recombination points  which can be visualized as a  structure across the individuals’ genome where each  reflects the chromosome segment that the half-sib inherited from its sire. To illustrate this  consider that SNP genotypes are numerically coded as    and  with  and  being homozygous and  heterozygous for a locus. For any given marker  if at least one half-sib has a  genotype and another one has a  genotype  the sire must be heterozygous at that locus and each half-sib progeny must have inherited one of the two allelic variants. To detect recombination between two neighbouring opposing homozygous sites in a pair of offspring  one offspring must have genotypes  and  at these loci and the other half-sib offspring must have a  and a  or  alternatively  one must be  and  and the other one has a  and . Hence  a recombination is identified if the sum of the genotype codes at these loci across two half-sibs is equal to 2 or 6. The actual physical distance between these loci will depend on marker density and allele frequencies. The algorithm is detailed in the next section. The following algorithm was used to partition the genome of each half-sib progeny into blocks according to the haplotype it inherited from the sire. First  the markers for which the sire can be determined as heterozygous based on the offspring genotypes are identified (Figure A). Second  based on these markers  an empty matrix is created with dimensions equal to the number of half-sibs in the family by the number of markers. For the first locus we split the half-sibs into two  groups based on the strand they inherited from the sire to provide an anchor from which to extend the blocks. For this purpose  we arbitrarily assign a “” to progeny receiving the 0 allele and individuals that received the 1 allele are coded “”. This loosely refers to paternal and maternal strands but note that the assignment is entirely arbitrary and  are simply used to distinguish between the two paternal strands; i.e. the strands of grand-parental origin inherited from the sire. Half-sib progeny that are heterozygous for this locus are recoded to unknown by entering the dash symbol (-).  Genotype matrix (   are homozygotes   are heterozygotes)  blue genotypes highlight informative loci (opposing homozygotes – heterozygous in the sire  homozygous in the offspring).  Identification of the paternal origin of strands and recombination events () by using the . ( and  are arbitrarily assigned paternal and maternal strands of the sire).  Final result of  after filling in the loci for which the sire strand could be determined.  and  refer to the two strands in the sire; - (dash) is used for unknown strand.  Imputation and phasing of the sire by combining the original offspring genotypes and the block structure. A forward memory vector (FMV) is then created with the same number of rows as the number of half-sibs to temporarily store the grandparental origin codes () for this locus (Figure B). The FMV then steps to the next marker and  if there are no opposing homozygotes  the FMV codes of the previous locus are stored in the main  matrix for this marker column (Figure C). This is repeated until the FMV reaches the next opposing homozygous site (i.e. a marker for which both homozygous genotypes are present among the half-sib progeny). At this locus  the grand-parental origin of the paternal allele for individuals with opposing homozygous sites are determined and stored in vectors (e.g. Figure B  vectors  and ). These vectors represent the two possible configurations of the grand-parental origin of the paternal allele. These vectors are compared to the FMV and the number of switches (recombinations) between each vector and the FMV is computed. The vector that needs fewer recombination events to explain the observed data is kept for the next step (e.g.  in Figure B  vector  required less switches) and replaces the relevant values in the FMV  while the other genotypes (heterozygous sites) carry over as they were previously in the FMV. The values in the main matrix for the last locus are then updated accordingly (Figure C). This stepwise approach continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. Recombination occurs when the minimum number of switches between FMV and the vectors ( and ) that are created from the next opposing homozygous locus is greater than zero. However  switches can also result from genotyping errors  which occur at a frequency of around 1% []. To avoid the identification of spurious recombination events due to genotyping errors  once a potential recombination has been identified for a particular individual  a temporary FMV is created to step through adjacent markers and validate the recombination event. This temporary FMV slides across a number of markers (e.g. 30) and as soon as three markers confirm the recombination  the process is interrupted and the recombination is deemed valid. If downstream markers do not validate the recombination (i.e. another recombination within a small genomic window is required to fit the observed marker genotypes)  the recombination is considered to be due to a genotyping error and the original letters in the FMV for this marker are restored to nullify the recombination event. Each recombination event is evaluated in this manner. At the end of the process  the  matrix stores the grandparental origin of the alleles at each locus  therefore showing the blocks that were inherited by each half-sib. The block information can be used to estimate linkage disequilibrium  the number and location of recombination events  to impute sire genotypes and to phase progeny genotypes. Sire haplotypes are inferred by simply averaging the sum of the genotypes at each marker of the half-sibs that inherited a particular strand (block) from the sire. These averages are recoded as  and  by rounding to the nearest integer and assigned to the sire’s haplotypes (Figure D). Albeit extremely simple  this approach is robust and computationally expedient  as detailed in the Results section. Genotyping errors are implicitly corrected for in the sire by selecting the most probable allele (Figure ).  Genotyping errors in the half-sibs. A highlighted genotype is indicative of a genotyping error because only one marker supports its change to another block.  Fixing the genotyping errors in the half-sibs. The block structure is used to reject the recombination suggested by the genotype (it is not supported by downstream markers).  Fixing the genotyping errors in the imputed sire. Based on the blocking structure in the genotypes  individuals 2  3  and 4 received the marker from the sire’s  strand (blue); the average number of markers (haplotype) in this location is 0.7  which is closer to 1 than 0 and this value is used as the sire’s imputed SNP genotype. Once the sire has been imputed and phased and the paternal strands have been partitioned across the half-sibs  the block matrix with parental origin codes ( and ) is then replaced by the paternal allele codes (0 or 1) pertaining to these origin codes. If the paternal origin code was uncertain  the origin was determined from the adjacent loci. The maternal haplotypes of the half-sibs are then obtained by simply subtracting the haplotype of a half-sib progeny from the sire from the individual’s genotype (Figure ). Note that the parental strands for a given chromosome in the sire are arbitrarily assigned to be of “” or “” origin  so we cannot formally determine whether the paternal haplotype origin is grand-paternal or grand-maternal  but we can confidently assign a block structure to the paternal haplotypes that is consistent among the half-sibs within a family.                                                          The algorithm is fully implemented as an open source R package. Implementation details are available from the source code. Three simulated datasets (datasets A  B  and C) were generated to evaluate  benchmark and compare the algorithm with other commonly used phasing methods. Accuracy of phasing was evaluated as the R between  known haplotypes of the simulated sires and half-sibs and the haplotypes inferred by the phasing programs  where these haplotypes have binary values (0/1). An R script was used to generate phased genotypes on a single chromosome for 500 000 SNP markers for a single sire and 400 half-sib offspring in order to evaluate runtimes of the algorithm on genotypes from high-density arrays. There were no genotyping errors. Allele frequencies were sampled from a uniform distribution U(0 1)  and recombination rates were distributed as U(0 6). This dataset was generated with the software QMsim that simulates data based on the population structure of commercial livestock animals []. We simulated a single chromosome of 500 cM  which is approximately 16% of the reported length of the sheep genome []. Three datasets were generated  each with sixteen generations and with  respectively  1250  5000 and 10 000 markers (for this setting ~8000 markers would be equivalent to the coverage of a 50K SNP chip). For each dataset  20 males were mated to 400 females at each generation and genotypes were recorded for the last seven generations. Each genotype dataset used for analysis consisted of 120 half-sib families of 40 individuals. The genotypes of half-sibs from the first generation were not used because the genotypes of the sires from this generation were required to estimate the accuracy of sire imputation. The program QMsim generates phased genotypes  which allows results from the phasing algorithms to be compared to the  haplotypes for sires and offspring. To evaluate the robustness of the algorithms to genotyping errors  the 1% of the genotypes from these datasets was randomly selected using the  function of R and randomly changed. To compare the phasing component of our algorithm with other methods  QMsim was used to generate one population with the following structure: 10 generations  1 chromosome of 500 cM and 10 000 markers  and 10 males and 200 females per generation. Only the genotypes from the last two generations were used and the genotypes of the sires from generation 8 were used to estimate the accuracy of imputation of the sires’ genotypes. Data generated by the SheepGenomics and the CRC for Sheep Industry Innovation on 4884 sheep genotyped with the 50K Illumina Ovine SNP chip and distributed across 110 half-sib groups were used. For expediency  after standard quality control filters  only data from chromosome 1 were used since it is the longest and has the largest number of markers (~5500). Data were from multiple breeds  the main breeds being Merino  White Suffolk  Border Leicester and Poll Dorset. Samples for genotyping were collected under approval number AEC12-049 of the University of New England Animal Ethics Committee. BEAGLE 3.3.2 [] and AlphaPhase 1.1 [] are well known programs used for population-based phasing and were used to benchmark our approach. BEAGLE was run with default parameters and without pedigree information. AlphaPhase was also run with default parameters and with and without pedigree information. These methods require at least 1000 individuals to obtain adequate results; therefore all 1200 individuals from dataset C were used. PedPhase 3 [] was used as a representative of pedigree-based phasing software that does not need large datasets. We ran PedPhase for all families  using single families of 20 half-sibs at a time (dataset C). Dataset A and C were used to compare computing times. To compare phasing accuracies between programs  the R programming language was used to calculate the R between the phased and  haplotypes in the offspring for dataset C. We match both of the arbitrarily assigned paternal/maternal haplotypes with the correct simulated haplotypes  and selected the ones that gave the highest R per chromosome. Then  for all predicted haplotypes  the squared product moment correlation between them and the  haplotypes was calculated. Marker loci that could not be phased by any of the programs were omitted before calculating the R values. Accuracy of phasing was also evaluated by calculating switch error rates (SWR). This was a function of the number of times an incorrect change of phase occurred in the inferred haplotype  divided by all possible switches. The mean of this number for each population was recorded and was calculated as: For ease of use an R package was created which is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or from . R is the  standard language for statistical programming and is widely used in genetic analyses. To achieve high performance  the algorithm was written in C++. The R package includes several functions to run the analyses and to visualise and evaluate results. We initially tested our algorithm for speed using dataset A that consisted of a half-sib family with 500 000 markers and 400 individuals. For this example  the time needed for strand identification and phasing was<U+2009>126 and<U+2009>249 seconds respectively (running as a single thread on a 2.8 GHz computer; hsphase can make use of parallelization  which can significantly reduce this runtime). Runtimes scaled nearly linearly in the number of animals and the number of markers. The algorithm is very fast and simple to parallelize which makes it suitable for analyses of very dense marker panels and even for sequence data. Using dataset C (1200 individuals in 30 half-sib groups and 10 000 markers)  we compared hsphase with other software programs. Population-based phasing took 42 minutes for AlphaPhase with pedigree  157 minutes without pedigree and 46 minutes for BEAGLE. PedPhase 3 was used to phase half-sib groups one at a time with 20 half-sibs per family (PedPhase does not support families with more than 23 half-sibs)  which required<U+2009>~0.5 seconds per family (~30 seconds for the entire dataset). The program hsphase had a similar speed and took 19.5 seconds for the entire dataset. Based on these results  hsphase was orders of magnitude faster than AlphaPhase or BEAGLE and slightly faster than PedPhase 3. It should be noted that this comparison excludes the time needed for reading the genotypes into R  which adds an additional 3.2 seconds to hsphase  but this can vary significantly depending on the original format of the data. Figure A and B show the true and inferred strands of paternal origin (blocks) for 40 half-sibs and 10 000 markers (derived from dataset C). The figure shows a very high degree of agreement between true and predicted strands and few regions where the origin of the strands is unknown. The latter regions appear at recombination break points because non-informative markers between opposing homozygous markers cannot be resolved. The length of these unknown regions essentially depends on marker density and heterozygosity of the sire. The same results were achieved with the phased data (haplotype of sire and offspring - Figure C). : true paternal strands of origin from the sire; : strand assignment (blocks) with hsphase  empty spaces indicate unassigned regions; : half-sib phasing with hsphase; : half-sib phasing with AlphaPhase with use of pedigree; : half-sib phasing with AlphaPhase without use of pedigree; : half-sib phasing with BEAGLE; : half-sib phasing with PedPhase; the red and blue colours indicate the paternal and maternal strands of the sire within each offspring  obtained by comparing the phased data with the sire’s true haplotypes; empty spaces indicate unknown strand or haplotype. The R between true and detected strands was calculated to evaluate the accuracy of paternal strand detection. The value of R was very sensitive to errors related to phasing and identification of recombination events  but high values were achieved for most half-sib groups which indicate that the error rate was very low. Genotype errors  low-density markers and small half-sib groups had an adverse effect on the algorithm’s ability to correctly allocate grand-parental origin to the paternal chromosomal segments  and larger half-sib groups were required to give acceptable accuracy (R<U+2009>><U+2009>0.90) and get a clear blocking structure  i.e. a structure with a realistic number of recombinations and few segments where the correct paternal segments could not be identified. As expected  R increased and its standard deviation decreased as the number of half-sibs increased (Table ). Once the paternal chromosomal segments have been assigned  the blocking structure can be used for analysis of recombination events  e.g. detection of hot and cold spots  number of recombination events  extent of LD  etc. The resolution with which recombination can be resolved depends on the marker density and average distance between informative markers. It is possible that double recombination events are missed with this approach but this should be minimal with high-density SNP chips unless the sire’s heterozygosity is very low. The image plots shown in Figure  can be generated using a function available in hsphase and are a useful visual diagnostic tool to evaluate the accuracy of strand detection and/or phasing. Recombination rates and the extent of LD are well established in most livestock species. Visual inspection of Figure E and F highlights that some individuals in the group appear to have a very large number of recombinations  which is not realistic. The main reason for a large number of recombinations observed in the sire is incorrect assignment of haplotypes in the offspring  i.e. haplotype blocks coming from the dam were assigned to the sire (e.g. animal 9 in Figure F); this generates a random scatter of switches between the two sire strands because that region did not originate from the sire. Inadequate phasing or a pedigree error shows a similar effect but  in those cases  random switches are seen across the entire chromosome instead of being compartmentalized into blocks. Finally  PedPhase 3 was unable to phase some loci that are in high LD (Figure G). Dataset B was used to evaluate the accuracy of sire genotype imputation using the genotypes and paternal strand blocking structure that were identified in the half-sib groups. We tested the robustness of the algorithm by varying the number of individuals (between 4 and 40) per family. Since sire genotype imputation made use of information from multiple half-sib blocks  the accuracy was higher than the accuracy of strand allocation but was still directly related to correct block detection. As shown in Table   with families of size four  the accuracy of imputation was low at around 0.75 and only 50% of the markers were imputed correctly. For this case  increasing marker density had no effect on accuracy. With eight half-sibs per family  R and the number of markers correctly imputed ranged from 0.84 and 82% with 1250 markers to 0.95 and 80% with 10 000 markers. In this case  increasing marker density increased accuracy of sire imputation but not the percentage of markers that imputed correctly. With family sizes of 40 individuals  accuracies were essentially around 1.0 and 100% of the markers could be imputed. In general  marker density was more important when family size was at least six and with a family size greater than 20  the family information dominated and increasing marker density resulted in limited gains. Increasing the number of markers yielded quite significant improvements in accuracy when family size was around 10 offspring. Results in Table  indicate that a family size of eight was the threshold for accurate imputation of sire genotypes. With genotyping errors of 1%  changes to accuracies and percentage of markers imputed were negligible (Table ) []. Since the accuracy of imputation of sire genotypes was high  we consider that the imputed sire genotype can be applied as an additional quality control step to detect sire genotyping errors in real data when 20 or more half-sibs are available; sire imputation can also be used as a replacement for sire genotyping. The accuracy of half-sib phasing was high  even with very small family sizes  but with less than 10 half-sibs per family  the number of markers that could be phased decreased (Table ). The latter was caused by a lack of opposing homozygous markers in the half-sibs to detect heterozygous sites in the sire. For family sizes between six and eight  the phasing accuracy dropped slightly because the number of individuals with ambiguous recombination sites increased (Table ). The switch error rate (SWR) was more sensitive to the marker density. In the worst scenario (low-density markers  1% genotyping errors and a family size of four)  92% of heterozygous sites were correctly phased with an SWR of 7.5%. With high-density markers (10 000 SNPs  1% genotyping errors and a family size of four)  the SWR was 3.5% and with a family size of 40 it was 1.7% but the R of haplotype inference for four and 40 half-sibs was nearly the same. Dataset C was used to compare the hsphase algorithm with other methods in terms of phasing accuracy. The hsphase approach used information from only one half-sib family at a time  whereas AlphaPhase and BEAGLE used the information of all 1200 individuals across families because these methods rely on population parameters and therefore require larger datasets for satisfactory performance. PedPhase also used data from one family at a time but the program will not allow families with more than 23 individuals and also requires genotypes of the sire. Figure  illustrates how accurately the different programs allocated the sire’s strands to each half-sib. AlphaPhase with the use of pedigree information obtained very accurate results; with only a small overestimation of the number of recombination events as manifested by a limited number of short haplotypes (Figure D). The blocks were created from the haplotype of the sire and these haplotypes were generally correct  suggesting that the haplotype library method is efficient. AlphaPhase (pedigree free) considerably overestimated the number of recombination events for some individuals (Figure E). BEAGLE showed problems in particular regions  probably because part of the dam’s haplotype was assigned to the sire (Figure F). The accuracy of hsphase was also very high (Figure B)  with better estimates of recombination events than other algorithms of haplotype reconstruction. The results show that hsphase gives accurate results with fewer incorrect indications of recombination  correct assignment of haplotypes between sire and dam  and correct assignment of blocking patterns in the paternal strands. The R obtained by randomly phasing dataset C was<U+2009>~0.28 (based on the mean of 10 000 repeats)  which sets the baseline for comparison of the different methods. The R of AlphaPhase with use of pedigree and hsphase were nearly the same. The R of AlphaPhase without use of pedigree was less than 0.5 (Figure A). The reason for this low R is that one switch (incorrect recombination) in the middle of a strand can affect the phasing of the rest of the strand. The same effect was observed with BEAGLE (Figure A) but to a lesser extent. Genotyping errors of 1% only had a moderate effect on hsphase (Figure B) but a larger effect on the other methods. However  if the population is large and includes a considerable number of small half-sib groups with reliable pedigree data  AlphaPhase is recommended over hsphase since hsphase cannot accurately phase small half-sib groups. However  when family sizes are larger than 10 half-sibs  hsphase is preferred since it is much faster and more accurate than the other methods  particularly when the total number of genotypes is small. PedPhase had a higher R than AlphaPhase and BEAGLE but this method gave more variable results  probably driven by the fact that all markers are phased by this method (Figures A and A). Genotyping errors reduced the accuracy of PedPhase and further increased variability. PedPhase requires that the genotypes of the sire are included in the analysis in order to use a pedigree approach.  Boxplot of  between inferred and true haplotypes for 20 half-sib families. Dataset C includes 10 000 SNP markers and 20 half-sib families with 40 individuals per family.  Boxplot of  between inferred and true haplotypes for the same data with 1% random genotyping error.  Boxplot of  between inferred and true haplotypes.  Boxplot of switch error rates. H = hsphase; P = PedPhase with 5  10 and 20 half-sibs per family; E = with 1% random genotyping error. The switch error rate (SWR) was low for all methods  ranging from 0.01 to 0.05%  except for PedPhase  which had an SWR of<U+2009>~0.5%. This suggests that these population-based methods as well as hsphase are all good at phasing over smaller chromosome segments and this can be useful for the purpose of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping or in case–control studies. As mentioned above  it is also possible to use the phased half-sib data to create a block structure  which is useful to evaluate the algorithms based on their power to infer these blocks  both visually and by counting the number and distance between recombination events in each individual. Based on length of the chromosome  a certain number of recombination events are expected. An unrealistic number of recombinations in the blocking structure provide evidence of either a pedigree error or algorithmic problems. Overall  we observed an improvement in accuracy with hsphase compared to other methods  particularly with 1% genotyping errors (Figure B). With the simulated datasets  we could use the image plots in Figure  to compare the inferred blocks of phased results with the true sire haplotypes. However  even with real data  for which the sire haplotypes are unknown  the inferred blocking patterns can be used to evaluate phasing algorithms. It should be noted here that both AlphaPhase and BEAGLE make extensive use of a wide range of parameters such as number of surrogates  percentage surrogate disagreement  and number of iterations and so on. The accuracy obtained with these methods could probably be increased if the choice of parameters was optimized for these datasets. The image plot and the number of recombinations per individual can be useful to identify the optimal phasing parameters. Figure  shows the sire’s blocking structure that was inferred by the different methods for a phased half-sib family with 23 individuals from the real dataset. Results were consistent with the simulated data (Figure ) and both BEAGLE and AlphaPhase without the use of pedigree showing too many recombination events. The blocking structure inferred by hsphase (Figure A) was biologically realistic since it had a plausible number of recombination events and the recombinations occurred not too close to each other. The recombination events can be identified based on the block structure and this can be visualised for the half-sib group as done in Figure . AlphaPhase  BEAGLE and PedPhase showed excessive numbers of recombination events in some individuals (Figures B C D E). Therefore  hsphase seems to be the only one that is able to give a reliable indication of the recombination events. : hsphase; : AlphaPhase with pedigree; : pedigree free AlphaPhase; : BEAGLE; : PedPhase; red and blue colours indicate the sire’s strands inherited by each offspring  obtained by comparing the phased data with the sire’s phased haplotypes  as inferred by the respective methods (the sire’s genotypes were part of the dataset); empty spaces indicate unknown strand or haplotype. The accuracy of imputation of sire genotypes with hsphase was evaluated using all 110 half-sib families and compared to the true genotypes of the sire. The R between observed and imputed sire genotypes had a mean of 0.95 and a median of 0.98 (Figure ). For families with less than 10 half-sibs  the number of marker genotypes that could be imputed decreased dramatically (Figure ). The maximum accuracy obtained for sire imputation in real data was around 97%. Genotyping errors prevent a 100% accuracy of imputing the sire genotype. By comparison  the accuracy of imputation of sire genotypes with hsphase was around 99% in simulated data when the half-sibs family size was larger than 20 and with 1% genotyping error.   values (in blue) between imputed and observed sire genotypes (for sheep chromosome 1)  with different numbers of half-sibs per family (110 groups  mean<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.95  median<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.98) and percentage of imputed SNPs (in red) in the sires. The vertical line is for families of size 10. In this work  we proposed a simple method that relies on linkage disequilibrium within families and uses loci with opposing homozygotes within a half-sib family to identify paternal chromosomal segments and recombination events. The resulting paternal  structure can be used for phasing and imputation of sire genotypes. An R package  that implements the method has been made available. The computational speed of the algorithm allows it to be used on large datasets. The accuracy of blocking and sire imputation of the algorithm was high when eight or more half-sibs were available. Imputation of sire genotypes was accurate and might eliminate the need to genotype the sire. For phasing  even a single family of four individuals had an R above 0.95 but the percentage of markers phased was ~70%. In addition  it was shown that the blocking structure derived from the paternal strand of origin is a valuable diagnostic tool to quantify and detect phasing and pedigree errors irrespective of the phasing method employed. Lastly  we suggest that if sequence or high-density marker data is available for the sire  the blocking structures lend themselves to imputation of the paternal strand in half-sib family groups.

Several factors influence the accuracy of imputation and our objective was to investigate the effects of the size of the reference population used for imputation and of the imputation method used and its parameters. Imputation of genotypes was carried out from 50 000 (moderate-density) to 777 000 (high-density) SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).MethodsThe effect of reference population size was studied in two datasets: one with 548 and one with 1289 Holstein animals  genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD chip (777 k SNPs). A third dataset included the 548 animals genotyped with the 777 k SNP chip and 2200 animals genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 chip. In each dataset  60 animals were chosen as validation animals  for which all high-density genotypes were masked  except for the Illumina BovineSNP50 markers. Imputation was studied in a subset of six chromosomes  using the imputation software programs Beagle and DAGPHASE.ResultsImputation with DAGPHASE and Beagle resulted in 1.91% and 0.87% allelic imputation error rates in the dataset with 548 high-density genotypes  when scale and shift parameters were 2.0 and 0.1  and 1.0 and 0.0  respectively. When Beagle was used alone  the imputation error rate was 0.67%. If the information obtained by Beagle was subsequently used in DAGPHASE  imputation error rates were slightly higher (0.71%). When 2200 moderate-density genotypes were added and Beagle was used alone  imputation error rates were slightly lower (0.64%). The least imputation errors were obtained with Beagle in the reference set with 1289 high-density genotypes (0.41%).ConclusionsFor imputation of genotypes from the 50 k to the 777 k SNP chip  Beagle gave the lowest allelic imputation error rates. Imputation error rates decreased with increasing size of the reference population.

Several factors influence the accuracy of imputation and our objective was to investigate the effects of the size of the reference population used for imputation and of the imputation method used and its parameters. Imputation of genotypes was carried out from 50 000 (moderate-density) to 777 000 (high-density) SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). The effect of reference population size was studied in two datasets: one with 548 and one with 1289 Holstein animals  genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD chip (777 k SNPs). A third dataset included the 548 animals genotyped with the 777 k SNP chip and 2200 animals genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 chip. In each dataset  60 animals were chosen as validation animals  for which all high-density genotypes were masked  except for the Illumina BovineSNP50 markers. Imputation was studied in a subset of six chromosomes  using the imputation software programs Beagle and DAGPHASE. Imputation with DAGPHASE and Beagle resulted in 1.91% and 0.87% allelic imputation error rates in the dataset with 548 high-density genotypes  when scale and shift parameters were 2.0 and 0.1  and 1.0 and 0.0  respectively. When Beagle was used alone  the imputation error rate was 0.67%. If the information obtained by Beagle was subsequently used in DAGPHASE  imputation error rates were slightly higher (0.71%). When 2200 moderate-density genotypes were added and Beagle was used alone  imputation error rates were slightly lower (0.64%). The least imputation errors were obtained with Beagle in the reference set with 1289 high-density genotypes (0.41%). For imputation of genotypes from the 50 k to the 777 k SNP chip  Beagle gave the lowest allelic imputation error rates. Imputation error rates decreased with increasing size of the reference population. For applications for which computing time is limiting  DAGPHASE using information from Beagle can be considered as an alternative  since it reduces computation time and increases imputation error rates only slightly. Since 2007  large numbers of dairy cattle have been genotyped with various 50 k chips  mainly the BovineSNP50 BeadChip []. Genotypes obtained from these chips can be used to perform association studies to identify loci that affect traits of interest  or to obtain more reliable breeding values at a younger age  to enable genomic selection of animals. These genomically enhanced breeding values (GEBV) are used routinely in several breeding programs. Apart from the BovineSNP50 BeadChip  other 50 k chips have been developed. Genotype imputation  which predicts marker genotypes at non-genotyped loci  has been used to share information generated by different 50 k chips  and facilitates the exchange of genotypes between organizations using different chips [  ]. Imputation uses either population-based or family-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) between loci  or a combination of these two types of information  to derive genotypes at non-genotyped loci. Various imputation algorithms and software have been developed. The most commonly used software packages for bovine datasets are Beagle []  AlphaImpute []  Fimpute []  Impute []  findhap [] and the PHASEBOOK package  which consists of LinkPHASE and DAGPHASE []. Imputation has been shown to be accurate: imputation between two different 50 k chips with approximately 10 k SNPs in common resulted in an allelic imputation error rate of 1.0% when using DAGPHASE  and when approximately 1000 animals had genotypes on both chips []. A 1.0% imputation error rate is considered sufficiently low to allow exchange of genotypes between different SNP chips []. Imputation can also be applied to predict genotypes on higher density chips from lower density chips  e.g. the Illumina Bovine3K chip []  that contains 2.9 k SNPs  or the Illumina BovineLD chip [  ]  with 6.9 k SNPs. Several authors have investigated imputation error rates obtained when genotypes were imputed from this or other low-density panels to the Illumina BovineSNP50 chips. Weigel et al. [] used a Jersey reference population of 2542 animals genotyped with 43 k SNPs. They applied IMPUTE 2.0 [] and found genotype imputation error rates of 10.8% and 5.8% when validation animals had genotypes for only 5 or 10% of the SNPs  respectively. Thus  allelic imputation error rates were approximately equal to 5.4 and 2.9%  respectively. Dassonneville et al. [] found imputation error rates of 5.5% and 3.9% in a Nordic and French dataset with approximately 3000 reference animals  when imputation was performed from the Illumina Bovine3K chip to the Illumina Bovine50K chip. When the size of the reference set was approximately 11 000 (dataset 1) or 12 000 animals (dataset 2)  imputation error rates were 4.0 and 2.1%  respectively. Mulder et al. [] found allelic imputation error rates of 3.8 and 2.8% when imputing from an in-silico chip of 3 k and 6 k SNPs  respectively  to 50 k SNPs  using DAGPHASE [] and a reference set for imputation of approximately 5300 animals. Dassonneville et al. [] studied imputation error rates using the Beagle software [] for imputing genotypes from the Illumina Bovine 3 K and two in-silico chips (with 3 k and 6 k SNPs) to the BovineSNP50 chip in the Holstein  Montbéliarde  and Blonde d’Aquitaine breeds. Within breeds  the lowest allelic imputation error rate was 0.9% for imputation from the 6 k in-silico chip with the Holstein breed and the highest error rate was 4.8% for imputation from the Illumina Bovine3K chip with the Blonde d’Aquitaine breed. Differences between breeds were to a large extent due to the size of the reference population in each breed. The reference population for imputation was largest in Holstein (3071 animals) and lowest in Blonde d’Aquitaine (754 animals). In 2010  the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip [] with approximately 777 k SNPs became available. A strategy to take advantage of the BovineHD chip could be to re-genotype all animals previously genotyped with low- or moderate-density chips  but the resulting gain in reliability of GEBV may not outweigh the large additional cost. Therefore  genotyping part of the population with the BovineHD chip and subsequently imputing the animals genotyped with 50 k chips to the HD chip is considered an attractive alternative  provided that imputation can be done with a low error rate. Imputation error rate depends on several factors  some of which were illustrated in the above examples: (1) effective population size; (2) number of markers on the lower density and the higher density chips; (3) distribution of markers on those chips; (4) (minor) allele frequency of the imputed alleles; (5) quality of the marker map used for imputation; (6) relationship between the animals in the reference set and the animals to impute; (7) number of animals in the reference set for imputation (i.e. genotyped on high density); and (8) the imputation method and  if applicable  the parameter settings used. Factors 6–8 are to some extent under our control and can be varied to study their effect on imputation error rates. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of reference population size used and the imputation method and its parameters on the error rate for imputation from the BovineSNP50 to the BovineHD chip. Datasets composed of animals genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD chip (Illumina  San Diego  California  USA) were created. In the remaining of this manuscript  this chip will be referred to as the HD-chip. Dataset 1 (Table ) consisted of the first batch of animals genotyped with the HD-chip by the Eurogenomics consortium. These were 548 high impact bulls from the Eurogenomics reference population []  for which the call rate (fraction of SNPs for which the genotype was scored) was at least 0.90. Dataset 2 consisted of the animals in dataset 1  plus 410 males and 331 females. All 1289 animals had a call rate of 0.90 or higher. In dataset 1  four different validation groups were formed  each consisting of 60 different animals that did not have any descendants with HD-genotypes. For the validation animals  the genotypes of all markers except those on the Illumina BovineSNP50 [] were masked. In the remaining of this manuscript  this chip will be referred to as the 50 k-chip. The HD-genotypes of the remaining 488 animals in each subset were used as reference to impute the masked genotypes of the 60 validation animals. In dataset 2  the same four validation groups were formed as in dataset 1  and the reference set consisted of the remaining 1229 animals. In addition to these two datasets that contained only animals with HD genotypes  a third dataset was constituted as an alternative to dataset 1. In dataset 3  2200 bulls genotyped with the 50 k-chip were added  to study the effect on imputation of adding information that could assist in optimally phasing the HD genotypes. Genotype data was edited as follows: (1) SNPs with a minor allele frequency less than 0.025 were removed; (2) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: SNPs for which the fraction of heterozygotes deviated by more than 0.15 from the expected fraction of heterozygotes based on allele frequencies were removed; (3) call rate: SNPs with called genotypes for less than 90% of the animals were removed. In all datasets  only SNPs mapped to either BTA1  6  11  14  20  or 29 were selected. This subset was chosen to reduce computational effort  and this number of chromosomes was considered large enough to produce imputation results that would be representative for the whole genome  and also provide insight into variation between chromosomes with regard to imputation results. Details on the chromosomes used in the analysis  with regard to the number of unmasked loci  total number of loci  fraction of unmasked loci in validation animals  and length of the chromosome are in Table . The marker map used for imputation was the UMD 3.1 map (University of Maryland  College Park  MD). In dataset 1  imputation was performed using the different imputation software packages with parameter values presented in Table . Method A was the method described by Druet and Georges []  and uses both linkage and linkage disequilibrium information to optimize phasing and imputation. Briefly this method consisted of phasing haplotypes partially using LinkPhase []  10 iterative rounds of DAGPHASE [] and Beagle 2.1.3 [] to optimize phasing in the reference animals  and 10 rounds of alternating DAGPHASE and Beagle on the complete dataset  followed by one round of DAGPHASE using the Viterbi algorithm [] for haplotype reconstruction and imputation. The scale and shift parameters for Beagle were equal to 2.0 and 0.1  respectively. These parameters determine if clusters of haplotypes share enough similarity to merge into one cluster or not. The number of remaining clusters increases with decreasing values of the scale and shift parameters  and imputation accuracy is higher with a higher number of remaining clusters. Full details of this method can be found in []. Method B was the same as method A  except for the scale and shift parameters  which were chosen to be equal to 1.0 and 0.0. These are the default values used in Beagle. In method C  phasing and imputation were performed with Beagle (version 3.3.0)  without using pedigree (linkage) information. In Beagle 3.3.0  the default values for scale and shift are equal to 1.0 and 0.0  and cannot be changed. Method D used the directed acyclic graph (DAG) generated by Beagle in method C as input for one round of DAGPHASE. This method was considered as an attractive alternative to method C  because the already available DAG can be used for new animals genotyped on the moderate-density chip  without the need to impute previously imputed animals again []. The effect of imputation software and its parameters on imputation errors was obtained from analysis of dataset 1. The results of method C in datasets 1 and 2 provide insight on the effect of reference population size on imputation error rates. The effect of adding animals genotyped at medium density on imputation error rates is obtained by comparing results from dataset 1 and dataset 3. Datasets and imputation methods were evaluated for their allelic imputation error rate: where err(%) = allelic imputation error rate  as a percentage; n = number of alleles for which the imputed allele was not equal to the non-missing observed allele; n = number of alleles for which the imputed allele was compared with the non-missing observed allele. More information on imputation error rates was obtained by calculating the average allelic imputation error rate for a number of traceability classes. Traceability is defined as the additive relationship of a validation animal with its closest HD-genotyped ancestors  summed across all ancestry paths []. This can also be interpreted as the expected proportion of the genome inherited from HD-genotyped ancestors. Traceability has values between 0 and 1 when not accounting for inbreeding in the population. Validation animals were assigned to classes with 0.025 difference between highest and lowest traceability. Adjacent classes were joined into one class  to reduce the number of classes and to have approximately the same number of animals in all classes. The difference between highest and lowest traceability value in each class was maximized at 0.25. For each class  the average imputation error rate was computed. Higher imputation error rates are expected for low frequency alleles  because the reference population may contain limited or no information on the haplotypes that contain these alleles. To verify this  allelic imputation error rates will be presented as a function of the allele frequency  on a per allele basis. Because of the low frequency alleles  the contribution to overall imputation error rate per locus may be limited  and therefore the imputation error rate will also be presented as a function of the minor allele frequency. This is evaluated on a per locus basis  with imputation errors of both the low frequency and the high frequency allele being combined. Table  shows average imputation error rates across four replicates in the analyzed datasets and models. In dataset 1  with 488 reference animals genotyped with the BovineHD chip  Beagle and DAGPHASE with scale and shift parameters equal to 2.0 and 0.1 (method A) resulted in an average imputation error rate of 1.91% for the six analyzed chromosomes. When scale and shift parameters were changed to 1.0 and 0.0 respectively (method B)  the imputation error rate decreased to 0.87%. With Beagle alone (method C)  the imputation error rate was 0.67%. When the information from method C was used in one final round of DAGPHASE (method D)  a slightly higher imputation error rate (0.71%) was found. Methods A and C were also applied to dataset 3  which comprised 2200 additional animals with BovineSNP50 genotypes. This resulted in 0.03-0.04% lower imputation error rates than obtained without the additional 2200 BovineSNP50 genotypes. Method C was also applied to a dataset consisting of 1229 animals genotyped with the BovineHD chip (dataset 2). The average imputation error rate in dataset 2 was 0.41%  which was lower than what was obtained with method C in dataset 1 (0.67%) and in dataset 3 (0.64%). There were large differences in allelic imputation error rates between chromosomes (Table ). The lowest imputation error rate was observed for BTA14 in most dataset-method combinations  except for method A  where BTA6 had the lowest imputation error rate. In all analyses  the imputation error rate was highest for BTA29. Figure  shows the number of validation animals per class of imputation error rate  for method C and datasets 1 and 2. The distribution was skewed  with the largest number of animals in the lower imputation error rate classes.                                                  Figure  shows the allelic imputation error rate for each of 20 classes of allele frequency  for four combinations of method and dataset: method A  B  and C applied to dataset 1  and method C applied to dataset 2. For all four alternatives  the highest imputation error rate was found for alleles with the lowest frequency  ranging from 3.1% for method C applied to dataset 2  to 17.8% for method A applied to dataset 1. For allele frequencies higher than 0.50  the imputation error rate was less than 1%  except for method A applied to dataset 1  for which the imputation error rate was less than 1% only for classes of allele frequency larger than 0.80. When results are evaluated on a per-locus base  then the low frequency alleles contribute relatively little to the overall imputation error rate. The low frequency allele is always associated with a high frequency allele which has a low imputation error rate  as shown in Figure   in which results are presented as the imputation error rate per minor allele frequency class  for the analysis of method C (Beagle version 3.3.0) on dataset 2 (1289 HD-genotyped animals). The highest imputation error rate was observed for the class of SNPs with a minor allele frequency between 0.35 and 0.40  and the lowest imputation error rate for SNPs with a minor allele frequency between 0.00 and 0.05.  Results are presented for four combinations of method (A  B or C) and dataset (1 or 2); method A: combination of Beagle 2.1.3 and DAGPHASE with scale and shift parameters equal to 2.0 and 0.1; method B: same as method A  but with scale and shift parameters equal to 1.0 and 0.0; method C: Beagle version 3.3.0; dataset 1: 548 HD-genotyped animals; dataset 2: 1289 HD-genotyped animals.  Results are presented for the combination of method C (Beagle version 3.3.0) and dataset 2 (1289 HD-genotyped animals). Figure  shows imputation error rates for each of a number of traceability classes. Imputation error rates were lower with higher traceability  i.e. when more HD-genotyped ancestors are present in the dataset. Results are presented for four combinations of method and dataset: method A  B  and C applied to dataset 1  and method C applied to dataset 2. For classes of animals with traceability above 0.50  there was a clear decrease in the imputation error rate with increasing traceability.  Results are presented for four combinations of method (A  B or C) and dataset (1 or 2). Method A: combination of Beagle 2.1.3 and DAGPHASE with scale and shift parameters equal to 2.0 and 0.1; method B: same as method A  but with scale and shift parameters equal to 1.0 and 0.0; method C: Beagle version 3.3.0; dataset 1: 548 HD-genotyped animals; dataset 2: 1289 HD-genotyped animals. Table  shows the average  minimum and maximum time needed per imputation method in dataset 1  calculated across all analyzed chromosomes and replicates. For this dataset  computation time was lowest for method D  DAGPHASE using the DAG obtained from Beagle. Computation time was highest for method B  DAGPHASE/Beagle with scale and shift parameters equal to 1.0 and 0.0  respectively. Imputation is a useful tool to obtain high-density genotypes for animals of interest while genotyping only part of the animals with the high-density chip. The remaining subset of the animals can be genotyped on lower density chips. However  there are errors associated with imputation  and some of the factors that influence imputation error rates were studied. Imputation from a moderate-density chip (50 k) to a high-density chip (777 k) was analyzed in three different datasets  to study the influence of both size and composition of the reference population for imputation on imputation error rates. In datasets 1 and 2  with 488 and 1229 reference animals respectively  all reference animals were genotyped with the HD-chip. Beagle 3.3.0 was used to compare results from these two datasets. The average imputation error rate decreased from 0.67% for dataset 1 (the smallest dataset) to 0.41% for dataset 2. This result shows that  although the imputation error rate was already small in dataset 1  the imputation error rate could be further decreased by adding more animals genotyped on the HD-chip to the reference set. Although intermediate sizes of the reference population were not tested  it is expected that the effect of further increasing the size of the reference population is limited. This expectation is based on analysis of subsets of dataset 1; when size of the reference population was increased from 200 to 300  400  and 500  the imputation error rate decreased by 0.17  0.13 and 0.04%  respectively. Datasets 1 and 3 were analyzed with various imputation software packages. In this study  Beagle performed better than the combination of Beagle and DAGPHASE (Table ). Using DAGPHASE has an advantage when linkage information is important  e.g. when both parents are genotyped or when the dataset contains large families. There is no advantage to using DAGPHASE when the density of the lower density chip is already relatively high  as in our study  because linkage disequilibrium information is more accurate at higher densities and can be extracted by Beagle with greater accuracy than by DAGPHASE. This study also showed that the parameters used for the DAGPHASE/Beagle combination strongly influenced imputation error rates. When scale and shift parameters were equal to 1.0 and 0.0  respectively  instead of 2.0 and 0.1  imputation error rates decreased from 1.91 to 0.87% (Table   method A and B)  at the expense of longer computation times (Table ). It is expected that lower values for the scale and shift parameters will result in lower imputation error rates in most datasets  but the balance between decreasing imputation errors and longer computation times may lead to different optimal parameters in different datasets. Sun et al. [] observed that imputation accuracy was positively associated with chromosome size  although this was based on an analysis of three chromosomes covering the range of chromosome sizes. In our study  chromosomes ranked differently for imputation error rates across the different datasets and methods studied (Table ). In most dataset-method combinations  BTA14 and BTA6 had the lowest imputation error rates  although BTA1 was the largest chromosome. In all dataset-method combinations  BTA29 had the highest imputation error rate. BTA14 had the highest number of BovineSNP50 markers per cM  and BTA29 had the lowest number of BovineSNP50 markers per cM (n50k/cM  Table ). Based on the characteristics mentioned in Table   the number of BovineSNP50 markers per cM influenced imputation error rate more than chromosome size. Although imputation errors were low on average  they can be quite high for individual alleles. This is illustrated in Figure : on average  low frequency alleles had relatively high imputation error rates. Because the low frequency alleles are not represented in any reference haplotype  the imputation program cannot derive the correct allele. The impact of errors for these alleles on the total imputation error rate is relatively low  because of their low frequency (Figure ). However  if these low frequency alleles are associated with deleterious alleles  then errors in imputation may have an impact on results of association studies for genetic defects  for example. Not only allele frequency  but also errors in the marker map can cause high imputation error rates for particular loci. Erbe et al. [] studied imputation to the HD-chip and found more than 20% incorrectly imputed genotypes for each SNP in a subset of 1231 SNPs. When these SNPs were remapped  imputation error rates were substantially lower for 601 of the 1231 SNPs. This factor may play a role in our study  because the map we used was the same as that used by Erbe et al. []. This means that imputation error rates could be even lower if a more accurate map became available. Figure  shows that the imputation error rate depends on the relationship between the imputed animal and the reference set used for imputation  as measured by traceability. When constructing a reference population for imputation to higher density chips or platforms (e.g. whole-genome sequence)  the policy to include the closest ancestors will contribute to a decrease in imputation errors. A few studies have investigated imputation from 50 k to HD chips. Larmer et al. (2012  unpublished data) studied imputation in the Holstein  Guernsey and Ayrshire breeds. The percentage of incorrect genotypes in the Holstein breed using 892 reference animals for imputation was 0.70%  which corresponds to an allelic imputation error rate of approximately 0.35%  which is slightly lower than in our study. Adding the two other breeds to the reference set did not decrease the error rate. Erbe et al. [] reported a genotype imputation error rate of 2.3% when using approximately 450 heifers as reference to impute 450 other heifers from the 50 k to the HD chip. When 93 key ancestor bulls were added to the reference population  the genotype imputation error rate decreased to 2.0%. In the Jersey breed  with only 93 key ancestors in the reference set  the genotype imputation error rate was equal to 4.2%. Allelic imputation error rates can be considered as equal to half of these values. Brøndum et al. [] showed that increasing the size of the reference population used for imputation by adding animals from other breeds is useful only if the breeds are related. Their study investigated imputation from 50 k to HD in Nordic Red breeds using different combinations of Nordic Red and Holstein animals in the reference population. With a reference set of 556 animals  consisting of animals of three breeds  the allelic imputation error rate was equal to 0.96% for 150 animals. This study investigated imputation errors from the 50 k to the HD chip. However  many animals are and will be genotyped with lower density panels  especially the Illumina BovineLD panel (6.9 k). As shown by Larmer et al. (2012  unpublished data)  imputation error rates when using FImpute [] were lower when imputation was first from the BovineLD to the 50 k chip and subsequently from the 50 k to the HD chip  rather than imputing directly from the BovineLD to the BovineHD chip. This may influence the implementation of imputation from various lower density chips to HD chips in routine operations. Mulder et al. [] analyzed the impact of imputation errors on the reliability of GEBV. The average imputation error rate was 3.8% for imputation from a 3 k in silico chip to a 50 k chip. Reliability of GEBV based on imputed genotypes was 2.1% lower than the reliability of GEBV based on real genotypes  averaged across 10 traits. For imputation from a 6 k in silico chip to a 50 k chip  the average imputation error rate was 2.6%. Reliability of GEBV based on imputed genotypes was 1.2% lower than the reliability of GEBV based on real genotypes. In French and Nordic data  the reliability of GEBV with imputed genotypes was 2 to 6% lower than the reliability of GEBV with real genotypes  for imputation from the 3 k to the 50 k chip []. In our study  we investigated the error rate for imputation from 50 k to HD chips. The impact of imputation error rate on the reliability of GEBV is expected to be relatively small  because the imputation error rate was small (0.41%). When imputation from lower density chips to HD chips is part of a weekly or monthly procedure for routinely processing genotypes  computing time may be an important factor in the choice of the imputation method. In this study  using Beagle only (method C) gave the lowest imputation error rates  and was relatively fast. However  computing time using Beagle increased relatively quickly when the number of animals genotyped with a moderate-density chip increased  compared to using a combination of DAGPHASE and Beagle (methods A and B)  or with DAGPHASE using the DAG obtained from Beagle (method D) (results not shown). Because imputation error rates with method D were only slightly higher than imputation error rates with method C  method D is an attractive alternative for routine procedures  once the DAG from method C is obtained. The allelic imputation error rate for imputation from the Illumina BovineSNP50 to the Illumina BovineHD chip was equal to 0.67% when a reference set of 488 animals was used. This imputation error rate was reduced to 0.41% when the reference set was increased to 1229 animals. In both situations  Beagle 3.3.0 was used. Results were slightly improved by adding animals genotyped with the 50 k chip to the dataset. Application of DAGPHASE using information from Beagle gave slightly poorer results but is an interesting alternative in applications where computing time is a limiting factor.

Low-density genotyping with a 2K SNP panel followed by imputation provides a compromise between cost and accuracy that could promote more widespread genotyping  and hence the use of genomic information in horses. In addition to offering a low cost alternative to high-density genotyping  imputation provides a means to combine datasets from different genotyping platforms  which is becoming necessary since researchers are starting to use the recently developed equine 70K SNP chip. However  more work is needed to evaluate the impact of between-breed differences on imputation accuracy. The introduction of high-throughput  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips that permit the analysis of large numbers of SNPs in parallel has enabled large-scale studies of human and livestock populations. A common feature of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that large sample sizes are needed to ensure sufficient power to detect what are hypothesised to be quantitative trait loci (QTL) with relatively small effects. To validate any detected QTL  both a substantial number of samples for the initial analysis and a second independent sample are required. Furthermore  any underlying data structure  such as that caused by different ancestries  e.g. different breeds in the case of livestock  and the presence of environmental factors  has the potential to reduce power for a given sample size. In the equine setting  the accumulation of large numbers of samples represents a significant challenge. Since the introduction of the first equine SNP chip by Illumina in 2007  several GWAS of monogenic diseases have been successful in identifying associated regions of the genome and in several cases  causal mutations [–]. However  results for the analysis of complex traits have been less convincing; some studies have reported QTL  but many of these QTL have been defined with  significance thresholds  since authors attempt to balance the risk of Type I and Type II errors [  ]. The apparently low signal to noise ratio is an indication of the low power  caused in part by small sample sizes. Moreover  insufficient validation has been done to confirm whether or not these initial findings are true associations or false positives. One of the reasons for small sample sizes is the cost of genotyping. While the cost of genotyping with SNP chips has fallen during the last few years  the cost relative to potential return remains important  and within some sectors of the equine industry  e.g. the UK sport horse sector  the potential to make significant returns from breeding superior animals is generally limited. Therefore  the development of genomic approaches to breeding in the equine industry requires more cost-effective genotyping. One opportunity to reduce genotyping costs is the development of low-density genotyping. If a reference population of individuals genotyped at high-density is available  individuals from a test population or selection candidates can be genotyped for a subset of these loci on a low-density panel (LDP)  followed by imputation to fill in the ‘missing’ SNP genotypes []. Provided the reference population and the test population are genetically similar in origin  population genetic models can use correlations between alleles at neighbouring loci measured in the former to predict unobserved genotypes in the latter []. The dependence of imputation accuracy on the SNP density in the LDP means that there will always be a trade-off between the cost of genotyping and the accuracy of imputation. Other factors that affect the accuracy of imputation include levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the population  the degree of similarity between the reference population and the test population and  to some extent  the size of the reference population [–]. Efforts to develop improved imputation algorithms have resulted in a wide range of software programs  most of which have evolved from programs written to infer haplotype phase from large-scale genotype data. Commonly used programs include fastPHASE []  MACH []  IMPUTE []  AlphaPhase [] and BEAGLE []  and their relative efficacies have been explored under various scenarios [  –]. Whereas some of these imputation methods use linkage analysis to exploit known relationships between individuals  in many cases  knowledge of relationships is not required and population-wide LD between SNPs is used. Because the imputation method relies on LD between SNPs on the LDP and the remaining SNPs on the high-density panel  the choice of SNPs for the LDP also affects the accuracy of imputation. A significant effort has been devoted to optimising LDP SNP selection and several algorithms have been developed along this vein. Many programs use LD between pairs or groups of markers to select LDP SNPs in a so-called block-free approach  e.g. Tagger [] or LDSelect []. Another common approach is to use haplotype information in a block-based approach  e.g. HapBlock []  while other more novel algorithms have been developed such as the neighbourhood graph approach of Halldórsson et al. [] or the multiple linear regression approach of He and Zelikovsky []. In situations where LDP SNPs are selected to predict haplotypes  they are commonly referred to as ‘tag SNPs’ (see Halldórsson et al. [] for a review). In this study  genotypes from the Illumina Equine SNP50 BeadChip () were used to investigate the accuracy of imputation that can be achieved in Thoroughbred horses  without pedigree information  and using a typical imputation program (BEAGLE). Three methods of LDP SNP selection were tested across six LDP sizes in order to evaluate the impact of various SNP selection criteria that involve both information content and LD of SNPs. The effect of geographical substructure on the accuracy of imputation was also investigated. The data for this study consisted of 853 Thoroughbred horses originating from the United Kingdom (UK dataset)  and 348 Thoroughbred horses from the United States (US dataset). The UK dataset had been the subject of two GWAS  and the US dataset had been the subject of a further GWAS  and each GWAS was structured as a case–control study for one of three diseases. None of the GWAS identified any major QTL for their target disease [] and so for the purpose of this study the horses were treated as population samples from two geographically distinct regions. In the UK  blood samples were collected by the Animal Health Trust between 2006 and 2008  from Thoroughbred horses competing in both flat- and jump-racing (513 males  340 females). Horses were from a wide geographical area and are expected to be relatively unrelated. Samples in the UK dataset were randomly assigned to one of three subsets: Set A  containing 200 samples  which was used to select LDP SNPs; Set B  containing 490 (75%) of the remaining samples  which was used as the training reference population; and Set C  containing the remaining 163 samples (25%)  which was used as the test population  and which were assumed to be genotyped with the LDP. Genotypes for the LDP were obtained by masking SNPs that were not selected to be in the LDP being tested. A graphical representation of this data flow is in Figure .                                                      In the US  blood samples were collected over two years (2007 and 2008) from 348 Thoroughbreds (159 males  189 females) admitted to the Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital  Lexington (Kentucky). Horses originated from one of 19 surrounding horse farms  with the number of horses per farm ranging from two to 89. Since sampling was anonymous  pedigree details for the horses were not available but the data set was expected to consist of a mixture of half-sibs (by sire and by dam since data was collected across two years) and more distantly related horses. Two analyses were performed using this dataset along with the UK dataset to investigate imputation across populations. In the first analysis  the training information obtained from Set B in the UK dataset was used for imputation of the entire US dataset  which was assumed to be genotyped with the LDP. In the second analysis  samples in the US dataset were randomly assigned to one of two subsets: Set D  containing 261 samples (75%)  which was used as the training reference population  or Set E  containing the remaining 87 US samples  which was used as the test population and which was assumed to be genotyped with the LDP. A graphical representation of this data flow is in Figure . All blood samples were collected in EDTA  sent to the Animal Health Trust for further processing  and to Tepnel for DNA extraction (Tepnel has since been bought by Gen-Probe). An aliquot of each sample was diluted to 70 ng/µl and sent to Cambridge Genomic Services () for genotyping using the Illumina Equine SNP50 Genotyping BeadChip  which comprises 54 602 SNPs across all autosomes and the X chromosome. These SNPs were selected from a database of over one million SNPs () generated during the sequencing of the horse genome [  ]. All samples for this study were genotyped at the same time  along with samples for several other studies. The full dataset  a batch of 1342 samples  was checked using the Illumina GenomeStudio genotyping module. A series of quality control metrics identified 3895 poorly performing SNPs (7.1%) (see Additional file : Table S1). Genotypes for these SNPs were set to missing in all samples  leading to their subsequent exclusion during quality control undertaken specifically for this study (see below). Quality control was applied to Set A in order to generate a list of SNPs that were used in all subsequent stages of the analysis. SNPs that were genotyped in less than 95% of samples in the set and those with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.01 were excluded. The analyses within the UK dataset focused on four  (ECA) chromosomes: ECA1  ECA10  ECA20 and ECA26; these were chosen to represent the shortest (ECA26)  longest (ECA1)  and median length (ECA20) chromosomes (measured in cM  based on Swinburne et al. [])  and to include two centromeric chromosomes (ECA1 and ECA10) and two acrocentric chromosomes (ECA20 and ECA26). In the analyses with the US dataset  only ECA1 and ECA26 were analysed. After quality control  the dataset consisted of 3581 SNPs on ECA1 (18.0% excluded)  1532 SNPs on ECA10 (20.0% excluded)  1225 SNPs on ECA20 (17.5% excluded) and 781 SNPs on ECA26 (18.5% excluded). The three methods were used to select LDP SNPs  as detailed below. Genotype data from the 200 UK samples assigned to Set A were used to generate (i) the MAF of the SNPs for the algorithm used in Methods 2 and 3 and (ii) the LD map used in Method 3 (see below). In the within-population analysis of the UK dataset  the methods were tested at six different densities  representing genome-wide panels with 384  768  1K  2K  3K and 6K SNPs. The equivalent densities  expressed in terms of N (effective population size) SNPs per Morgan  as described in Solberg et al. []  were 0.09  0.18  0.24  0.48  0.72 and 1.44N/Morgan  assuming N<U+2009>=<U+2009>150 and a total genome of 27.72 Morgan []. In the subsequent analysis with the US dataset to assess the efficacy of imputation across populations  the LDP density tested was 2K  because at this density the within-population accuracy was always greater than 0.8. The number of LDP SNPs to be selected for a given chromosome () was proportional to the ratio of the length of the chromosome () to the whole genome () in terms of physical distance in base pairs (<U+2009>=<U+2009>). SNPs for the LDP were selected such that their spacing along the chromosome was approximately equidistant in base pairs. This was achieved by dividing the total base pair length of the chromosome into equally sized segments  the number of segments being equal to the desired number of LDP SNPs for the given LDP density () minus 1. The closest SNP to each segment boundary was then chosen to be a SNP in the LDP  irrespective of its MAF. SNPs for the LDP were selected so that their spacing along the chromosome was approximately equidistant in base pairs and their MAF was high. In order to meet both objectives  SNP selection was performed separately for each chromosome using a custom python program that applied a genetic algorithm. The cost function to be minimized included two components: the first component aimed at driving the MAF of the selected SNPs towards 0.5 by applying a penalty equal to  (1) and the second component ensured equal spacing. An ideal distance between SNPs    was calculated as:  and then  the spacing between consecutive SNPs  and <U+2009>+<U+2009>1 in the LDP was forced to approach  using the function: ((<U+2009>-<U+2009>)<U+2009>-<U+2009>) (2)  where S is the base pair position of the SNP. The set of  SNPs was then derived by iteratively minimizing the following function over all SNPs: In order to ensure good coverage at the telomeres  where recombination events are more frequent and hence accuracy of imputation is expected to be lower  the SNPs from the high-density panel that were closest to the ends of each chromosome were included in the LDP. In the absence of a detailed recombination map for the horse  an alternative measure of distance was used as a proxy  such that the assumption of uniformity of LD and recombination along the length of a chromosome could be removed. The proxy used was linkage disequilibrium units (LDU)  as calculated using the LDMAP program described and developed by Maniatis et al. []. The theory behind the LDMAP program is based on the Malecot equation []  and is described extensively elsewhere []. An LD map for each chromosome was constructed  using the genotypes of samples in Set A (for further details  see Additional file ). LD map distance has been shown to have a close relationship with linkage maps [] and recombination rates  at least to the extent that recombination hot spots can be identified []. Maps for all chromosomes can be found in Additional file : Figure S1. SNPs for the LDPs were then selected according to the same algorithm used in Method 2  but with SNP locations given in LDU instead of base pair positions. In cases for which SNPs were allocated to the same position in the LD map  a small addition was made to subsequent locus positions (10) before entering the SNP locations in the LDP SNP selection algorithm such that SNP order remained consistent with the physical map. The software program BEAGLE (v 3.3.1) [] was used to impute from low- to high-density markers without pedigree information  since none was available. The default parameters of the program were used throughout and the most likely genotype was taken to be the imputed genotype at masked loci. For comparison  masked loci were also imputed by random sampling of genotypes  conditional on the allele frequencies at the SNPs observed in the reference populations (Set B or Set D). Because no other quality control was carried out in the reference or test populations  at this stage  a small number of SNPs had a MAF below 0.01 and a very small number of SNPs were monomorphic. Imputation accuracy was evaluated for the three LDP SNP selection methods  the six LDP densities and four chromosomes  and was summarised per SNP and per individual. For each imputed SNP  imputation accuracy was assessed using two measures: (i) the proportion of genotypes for the SNP that were correctly imputed among samples; and (ii) the correlation between the true and imputed genotypic allele counts across all samples (homozygote for allele 1  coded 0; heterozygous  coded 1; homozygous for allele 2  coded 2). The very small number of loci where true or imputed SNP genotypes were monomorphic among samples  were excluded from the correlation calculations. Summary statistics were then calculated across all SNPs. For each individual  imputation accuracy was calculated using the same two measures: (i) the proportion of all of the horses’ genotypes that were correctly imputed; and (ii) the correlation between the true and imputed genotypes across all the horses’ SNPs when coded as above. As before  monomorphic SNPs were excluded from the correlation. Summary statistics were then calculated across all horses. Finally  an adjustment to the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes by the expected proportion that would be correct from random sampling of alleles was calculated as: []  where  is the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes achieved for the SNP and  is the expected proportion using random imputation. The expected proportion is given by <U+2009>+<U+2009>4<U+2009>+<U+2009>[]  where  and  are the frequencies of the major and minor alleles of the SNP in the reference population. This statistic adjusts for the fact that SNPs with a low MAF are likely to be imputed with high accuracy by chance alone. In order to explore possible causes of differences in imputation accuracy across SNPs  PLINK [  ] was used to calculate LD between pairs of SNPs using the squared correlation based on genotypic allele counts. This is identical to the  measure of LD when mating is at random  i.e. assuming genotypic frequencies are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium []. However  to denote the distinction from the true   the term  will be used. Values of  were calculated between all pairs of SNPs in Set A. Average pairwise  were then calculated for SNPs in 1 Mb sliding windows  with 0.5 Mb overlaps. The accuracy of imputation  as measured by the proportion of SNPs correctly imputed  increased as the number of SNPs in the LDP increased  as shown for ECA1 in Table  and Figure  (and in Additional file : Table S2 and Additional file : Figure S2  for all chromosomes). For example  using equidistant LDP SNPs (bpEQ)  the mean proportion of correctly imputed genotypes ranged from 0.59 at the minimum LDP SNP density of 0.09N/Morgan  to 0.97 at a density of 1.44N/Morgan. The increase was greatest at the lower densities and showed diminishing returns with further increases in density. A large range in the proportion of genotypes correctly imputed was observed between animals  particularly when the density of the LDP was lowest  when the proportion ranged from an average of 0.54 to an average of 0.93 across the three methods for ECA1. Although the difference in accuracy between the three LDP SNP selection methods was small or absent  Methods 2 and 3 reduced the variation in imputation accuracy across SNPs (see Figure  and Additional file : Figure S2). As shown in Table  for ECA1 (and Additional file : Table S3  for all chromosomes)  Methods 2 and 3 resulted in an increase in both the mean MAF of the selected LDP SNPs and the standard deviation of the distance between the LDP SNPs.  As calculated in the within-population analysis of the UK dataset and plotted against the total number of SNPs on a genome-wide LDP of equivalent density (figures for all chromosomes are in Additional file : Figure S2). Random imputation of genotypes at masked loci  based on allele frequencies in the reference population  quantifies the minimum imputation accuracy that can be expected. Figure  shows the strong dependency of the accuracy of imputation on MAF with random imputation and the results follow closely the expectation (see Methods). This relationship between MAF and imputation accuracy was less clear when BEAGLE was used for imputation  except at lower densities (Figure ).  As calculated in the within-population analysis of the UK dataset.  384 panel;  1K panel;  6K panel. In order to explore possible causes of differences in imputation accuracy between SNPs  imputation accuracy and average pairwise  were plotted against SNP position (bp) (Figure ). The hypothesised positions of the centromeres are also marked on the plots. Based on similarity with centromeric satellite sequences  it was assumed that the centromere position of ECA1 was located at 66 Mb or 89 Mb and of ECA10 at 28.2 Mb  although there was a second region between 81 Mb and 83 Mb that also contained some centromeric satellite-like sequences; ECA20 and ECA26 are not centromeric but regions identified for these chromosomes may represent regions that contained centromeres in the past  if the similarity with centromeric satellite sequences is real (CM Wade 2012  personal communication). Figure  shows considerable variation in imputation accuracy across the chromosome  which was often positively correlated with levels of LD. This variation was particularly marked for ECA10  for which a peak in imputation accuracy was observed in the region that surrounds the proposed centromere. When Method 3 (lduMAF) was used to select LDP SNPs the variation in accuracy across the chromosome was reduced  which led to a more consistent level of accuracy and a reduction in its correlation with LD levels; this corresponds to the decreased variance in imputation accuracy across SNPs observed when using this method shown in Figure  and Additional file : Figure S2. In general  the decrease in accuracy obtained with Method 3 in regions of high LD compared to Methods 1 and 2 was greater than the corresponding increase in low LD areas. This explains the inability of this method to improve mean accuracies above those achieved using Method 2 (bpMAF).  The figure presents Lowess curves  as calculated in R [–]; green<U+2009>=<U+2009>bpEQ; blue<U+2009>=<U+2009>bpMAF; red<U+2009>=<U+2009>lduMAF; black<U+2009>=<U+2009>mean linkage disequilibrium () in sliding windows of 1 Mb (with 0.5 Mb overlap); yellow<U+2009>=<U+2009>hypothesised position of the centromere.  ECA1;  ECA10;  ECA20;  ECA26. The correlation between true and predicted genotypes was also calculated as an alternative measure of imputation accuracy. While accuracies were generally lower when expressed as correlations  considerable differences between horses and between SNPs remained (Table  and Additional file : Table S4). A comparison of the two accuracy measures showed some correspondence but the relationship depended upon MAF (Figure a). Adjusting the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes for the expected proportion achievable by random imputation resulted in a much stronger relationship with the correlation between true and imputed genotypes (Figure b)  which was almost independent of the MAF  although SNPs with a lower MAF tended to show more variation in both measures of accuracy.

When Set B (the UK reference population) was used as the reference population for imputation in the US dataset  there was very little change in the mean proportion of correctly imputed genotypes relative to the within-population results (Table ). With random imputation  there was no difference in accuracy between the within- and between-population analyses for ECA1 whereas a small but consistent decrease of 0.01 in the mean was seen for ECA26. This small difference is presumably due to the high correlation between the MAF of SNPs in the two populations  which was equal to 0.91 for ECA1 and 0.90 for ECA26. Imputation using BEAGLE gave a similar pattern of results  with no difference in imputation accuracy for ECA1 and a slight decrease in accuracy for ECA26 when compared to the within-population results for the UK described above. When Sets D and E were used as reference and test populations  respectively  imputation accuracy was slightly increased compared to that obtained for within-UK imputation  for both imputation methods (random and BEAGLE) and for all three LDP SNP sets (Table ). This increase is probably due to the higher average relationship between horses in the US dataset compared to the UK dataset; when average genomic relationships were calculated for all samples using SNPs on ECA1 (as in [])  the mean relationship between horses was 0.022 in the US dataset and 0.003 in the UK dataset. In this study  the efficacy of imputation from low- to high-density in Thoroughbred horses was investigated and three methods for selecting the LDP SNP were compared. Two measures were used to assess imputation accuracy  the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes and the correlation between true and imputed genotypes. While these two measures were correlated  the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes was related to the MAF of the imputed SNPs. Adjusting the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes by the expected accuracy using random imputation (as in []) weakened the relationship with MAF  but emphasized the greater variation in imputation accuracies for SNPs with a low MAF. In contrast  the correlation measure provided an assessment of imputation accuracy that was less dependent on MAF. This property makes it preferable for comparing methods  which is a similar conclusion to that of Hickey et al. [] in their study on maize. However  because accuracy expressed as the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes is more easily compared to results of other studies  it is also presented here. The haplotype phasing and imputation program used here (BEAGLE) has been shown to perform similarly to other available software [    ] and therefore the results presented are considered to be representative. Increasing the SNP density of the LDP serves to reduce the considerable range in imputation accuracy between SNPs and between horses. For example  at the lowest density  some SNPs were imputed correctly for all horses  whereas other SNPs were correct in as few as 24% of horses (ECA10 bpEQ results). Increasing the density of the LDP led to an increase in the minimum accuracy across SNPs  so for ECA10 the 6K LDP gave a minimum accuracy of 83%. A similar effect was observed across horses. By calculating marker densities normalised by N  results can be compared to those from other studies and species. Using a 2K low-density panel in Border Leicester sheep  equivalent to a SNP density of 0.23N/Morgan (assuming N<U+2009>=<U+2009>242 [] and a total genome length of 36.3 Morgans [])  Hayes et al. [] achieved an imputation accuracy of approximately 0.73 (measured by the unadjusted proportion of correctly imputed genotypes). Thus  our results using the 0.24N/Morgan bpMAF SNP panel (the 1K panel) compare favourably  with accuracies that ranged from 0.74 to 0.84 across chromosomes. A study on Jersey cattle that used equivalent SNP densities also obtained accuracies in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 []. Random imputation resulted in a direct and predictable relationship between the MAF of SNPs and the accuracy with which they were imputed. This relationship was less evident when using BEAGLE for imputation  except at the lowest LDP SNP densities  for which the amount of information available from LD was presumably low. Using a genetic algorithm to preferentially select LDP SNPs that are more informative  i.e. having a high MAF  while simultaneously ensuring consistent coverage across the chromosome (bpMAF)  achieved a small but consistent increase in the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes  with increases ranging from 0.6% to 5.3% for the 1K SNP panel. Further small improvements might be obtained by differential weighting of the two parts of the objective function used  so making MAF of greater or lesser importance. Using method bpMAF to select LDP SNPs also resulted in a decrease in the variation in imputation accuracy across SNPs compared to the bpEQ method. A major source of the variation in imputation accuracy across SNPs was the extent of LD  with variation both between and within chromosomes. There was a tendency for imputation accuracies to be higher for the longer chromosomes (ECA1 and ECA10) and this coincides with the higher average LD of these chromosomes  shown by Corbin et al. []. Within chromosomes  SNPs in regions of high LD were imputed more accurately than SNPs in regions of low LD. The strength of this relationship differed between the four chromosomes and was strongest for ECA10  where the region of highest LD (and imputation accuracy) coincided with the hypothesised position of the centromere. This relationship between LD and the accuracy of imputation was not observed for ECA1  which suggests that the processes underlying the observed LD may be important. When locations of SNPs were scaled based on LD map distance (as a proxy for linkage map distance) prior to their selection for the LDP  as in Method 3 (lduMAF)  this relationship between LD and imputation accuracy was broken down (Figure ). This resulted in a decrease in the variance of imputation accuracy between SNPs. However  the change in mean imputation accuracy relative to Method 2 (bpMAF) was small and inconsistent  with an increase in accuracy for ECA26 and a decrease for ECA1. Using lduMAF to select LDP SNPs increased imputation accuracy for SNPs that were in low LD regions due to a greater concentration of SNPs selected in these regions  but the decrease in accuracy for SNPs in high LD regions was relatively greater  resulting in a trend for the mean accuracy to be reduced. The relatively poor performance of the lduMAF may be due in part to the use of  rather than  in the Malecot model. Constructing an LDP including consideration of  may give better results  although  is already low in Thoroughbreds at the densities used for the LDP []. An additional benefit may also be obtained if the lduMAF approach was applied at a genome-wide level  such that the number of LDP SNPs per chromosome was proportional to its LD map distance  rather than its base pair length as in the current implementation. If pedigree were available and if genotyping were to become common in the Thoroughbred  constructing accurate maps of intra-chromosomal linkage in Morgans derived from the phasing carried out within the imputation process would be straightforward (JM Hickey 2012  personal communication). Such maps could then be used directly to produce an LDP better able to capture recombination events and hence improve imputation accuracy. The results of analyses presented here suggest that there is some ambiguity over which properties of imputation are most important when assessing efficacy. Does the utility for imputation argue for choosing LDP SNPs to maximise the mean imputation accuracy  or to maximise a minimum (or low percentile of) imputation accuracy; as judged by SNPs or by horses? Concern over lower percentiles will place more value on reducing the variance of imputation errors. While the answer lies in the intended use of the imputed genotypes  it would be useful to have some generic assessment of imputation performance. One solution might be to use a utility function such as the area under the curve obtained from plotting SNP correlation against SNP position  as in Figure . The development of a whole-genome measure of imputation success  integrating location and accuracy  would allow for a more comprehensive and quantitative comparison of the different LDP SNP sets used in this study  in particular the relative usefulness of the novel lduMAF approach. Transferability across breeds and across countries within breeds is an important consideration when designing a LDP. Here  data from a cohort of US Thoroughbreds was used to evaluate the impact of geographical origin on the efficacy of imputation. While comparisons of within-UK  within-US and UK to US imputations involved reference and test populations of different sizes  studies have shown that the size of the reference population does not have a major impact on imputation accuracy for the sizes used here [  ]. In this study  replacing the UK test population with a sample of horses from a different geographical area (the US) had a negligible impact on imputation accuracy. This implies that similar LD patterns exist in both populations  which in turn indicates that the genetic differentiation between the UK and US populations is small  or that a similar LD structure exists due to a common recombination background  or both. The high correlation between MAF of SNPs in the two populations lends some credence to the former argument  while the relationship between LD and the centromere position in ECA10 suggests that the latter is also relevant. One can assume that the US and UK populations share some similarity  given the relatively recent breed formation (around 30 generations ago) combined with cross-border matings and the relatively small number of founders (effective number of studbook founders of 28.2 []). When average genomic relationships were calculated for all samples using SNPs on ECA1 (as in [])  the mean relationship of horses from the US with those from the UK was -0.01. Replacing both the UK reference and test populations with horses from the US resulted in an increase in imputation accuracy for the US test population compared to using UK horses as the reference population. This was despite the fact that the LDP SNPs were selected using a UK population sample. One explanation for this increase in accuracy is the higher average relationships in the US dataset  which has been shown to improve imputation accuracy []. However  the fact that there was no difference in the relative increase in imputation accuracy between the bpEQ LDPs (which is not population dependent) and the bpMAF and lduMAF LDPs (which do depend upon the UK dataset)  suggests that the LDP SNP sets are equally appropriate for both populations. Whether this result also holds across breeds is more doubtful. The frequent sharing of major haplotypes between diverse horse breeds [] suggests that a certain degree of accuracy should be maintained  but further indications of the likely efficacy of imputation across breeds may be sought by comparing allele frequencies of the breeds in question. The value of imputed genotypes depends on both their accuracy and their purpose. Daetwyler et al. [] observed that the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) achieved with SNP genotypes imputed from a sparse set of markers  as a percentage of that achieved for the dense SNP genotypes  was in all cases greater than the proportion of correctly imputed genotypes. Specifically  when 87.8% of missing genotypes were correctly imputed  the accuracy of GEBV was reduced by only 5%. Furthermore  the imputation accuracy greater than 0.90 that was achieved here for the 3K panel is very similar to that reported by Weigel et al. [] in a study on daughter pregnancy rate  which resulted in a GEBV accuracy of 0.642 when imputation was used (from a LDP of 2942 SNPs)  compared to 0.674 when all SNPs were genotyped (42 552 SNPs). Given these results  it is likely that an LDP of 2K to 3K SNPs could lead to sufficiently high imputation accuracies to be useful in Thoroughbred horses. Any loss of accuracy in imputation that occurs as a result of using lower density SNP panels must also be considered alongside the cost savings that would be achieved. Part of the accuracy lost might be recovered if the pedigrees of genotyped individuals were available []. However  based on estimated genotyping costs for 384 to 2K SNPs  with 1K and 2K SNP panel prices based on a custom chip construction  and for 3072 to 6K SNPs  based on the iSelect Infinium Assay  there is no difference in cost between genotyping 768 and 2K SNPs  or between genotyping 3072 and 6K SNPs (Source: GeneSeek representative  2012). Therefore  the logical choice is between a 384  a 2K and a 6K SNP panel  with these options offering 42  84 and 96% of the accuracy in imputation for 17%  29% and 40% of the cost of the equine 70K SNP chip (used because the Equine SNP50 BeadChip is no longer available to purchase)  respectively. Whilst the cost increases by the same amount (US$20) from 384 to 2K and then from 2K to 6K  the increase in imputation accuracy is more than three times greater from 384 to 2K than from 2K to 6K  suggesting that a 2K SNP panel represents better value for money. However  specific uses may demand specific accuracies  in which case cost could be less important. The results of this study show that it is possible to impute genotypes from low- to high- density in Thoroughbred horses with reasonable to high accuracy. An investigation of the source of differences in imputation accuracy revealed dependence on the MAF of the SNPs being imputed  and on the underlying LD structure. While equidistant LDP SNPs worked well  optimising LDP SNP selection to increase their MAF was advantageous leading to increased imputation accuracy  even when LDPs were subsequently used in a population of different geographical origin. By using LD map distance instead of physical distance to select LDP SNPs  differences in imputation accuracy between SNPs were reduced. Whereas a 1K SNP panel was generally sufficient to ensure that more than 80% of genotypes were correctly imputed  inference from other studies suggests that a 2 to 3K SNP panel would ensure that the subsequent loss in accuracy for  for example  genomic prediction was minimal [  ]. Furthermore  the relationship between accuracy and genotyping costs for the different LDPs  suggest that a 2K SNP panel would represent good value for money for Thoroughbreds. More work is needed to evaluate the impact of between-breed differences on imputation accuracy. Imputation makes it possible to use low-density SNP panels as a low cost alternative to high-density genotyping but it also provides a means to combine datasets from different genotyping platforms  a possibility that will become necessary as researchers are starting to use the recently developed equine 70K SNP chip.

Neutral variation can be shaped to a great extent by the hitch-hiking effects associated with selection  rather than just by genetic drift. When implementing long-term genomic selection  strategies for genomic control of inbreeding are essential  due to a considerable hitch-hiking effect  regardless of the method that is used for prediction of EBV. Genetic improvement in livestock is driven by increasing the frequency of favourable alleles at loci that affect the traits of interest in populations []. The magnitude of these increases is mainly determined by the allele substitution effects and allele frequency at these loci  along with the intensity and accuracy of artificial selection []. Genomic selection (GS) provides opportunities to enhance the accuracy of prediction of breeding values. Conventional selection methods exploit phenotypes of the individual and/or of its relatives’  e.g. using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) [  ]  whereas GS combines marker data with phenotypic and pedigree data (when available)  which increases the accuracy of prediction. In addition  marker data allow accurate estimation of mendelian sampling effects in GS  allowing more accurate within-family selection  which leads to a lower level of pedigree-based inbreeding in GS compared to BLUP [  ]. Pedigree-based inbreeding  however  might not reflect the true level of inbreeding. First  pedigree inbreeding is an expectation of the proportion of the genome that is autozygous (homozygosity caused by two identity-by-descent (IBD) genomic segments) but there is much variation around this expectation due to the stochastic nature of recombination []. For instance  the percentage of the genome that is autozygous among progeny of first cousins is 6.25% on average  with a standard deviation of 2.4% [–]. Second  the level of inbreeding greatly depends on the generation that is considered as the founder generation. Animals in the defined founder population are considered to be unrelated  although  in reality they are related. Third  pedigree inbreeding assumes that there are no systematic changes in allele frequencies due to selection  which means that the loci are expected to be neutral. This assumption will not hold if selection is performed on a trait that is controlled by a few QTL with large effect or a complex trait that is controlled by a large number of QTL and the size of the genome is limited. With selection  inbreeding at the QTL arises from selectively increasing the frequency of favourable alleles towards homozygosity  which may also give rise to a footprint of selection surrounding the QTL due to hitch-hiking []. As a result of hitch-hiking  selection will inevitably act on closely linked neutral loci and force them towards fixation  which may increase both allozygosity (homozygosity produced by alleles that are identical by state) and autozygosity  and thus will raise the level of inbreeding in the region surrounding the QTL [–]. Therefore  pedigree inbreeding substantially underestimates the loss of genetic variance  in particular in the region that contains a QTL with a large effect. Pedersen et al. [] found that for selection based on BLUP EBV  the rate of genomic inbreeding at all linked neutral loci across a chromosome that contains a major QTL was significantly higher than the rate of pedigree inbreeding. This indicates that  due to hitch-hiking effects  there are no neutral loci on a chromosome that contains a QTL. The development of technologies for typing dense marker genotypes provides opportunities to more precisely measure the fraction of the genome that loses genetic variability during selection. Dense marker genotypes can also be used to scan the genome of animals for runs of homozygosity (ROH). Runs of homozygosity in an individual result from the inbreeding to a common ancestor by inheriting chromosome segments that are IBD from both parents []. The longer (shorter) such segments are  the more recent (ancient) the relatedness is. Therefore  ROH is expected to provide a more accurate measure of relatedness and may be a better indicator for the true level of inbreeding than pedigree-based relatedness. In addition  previous studies have revealed that  when performing selection for many generations  GS increases the risk of losing favourable QTL alleles compared to phenotypic selection []  in particular in the first few generations. Some of these alleles are rare and unavoidably lost due to low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with any marker []. The remaining favourable QTL alleles are essential to maintain long-term genetic variance and response to selection. However  a systematic comparison of the loss of favourable and rare alleles between genomic and conventional selection methods as selection proceeds is lacking. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of long-term selection on changes in allele frequencies due to hitch-hiking and inbreeding. To achieve this  we first monitored (i) the fixation and loss of favourable alleles  (ii) the maintained genetic variance  and (iii) the accuracy of selection when employing genomic or conventional selection methods. Second  to better understand the effect of hitch-hiking  we explored the reduction of heterozygosity at loci that are closely linked to QTL for different selection methods. Third  we compared the overall level of inbreeding measured by ROH and pedigree. Fourth  we assessed to what extent changes in allele frequencies and inbreeding are affected by genetic architecture  i.e. heritability and the number of QTL. We compared GS on genomic EBV derived with two commonly used approaches: (i) genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and (ii) Bayesian Lasso (BL)  with two conventional selection methods  (iii) phenotypic selection (PS) and (iv) selection on EBV derived using phenotype-based BLUP. A detailed description of these models is in the section “Selection criteria”. The comparison was performed for all combinations of two levels of heritability and three numbers of QTL affecting the trait (Table ). Apart from changes in allele frequencies  inbreeding coefficients based on pedigree  genetic variance  and accuracy of selection were followed for 25 generations. Initially a historical population with an effective size of 200 (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>200) was simulated using QMSim []. The 200 animals were mated at random for 2000 discrete generations  with an equal sex ratio and without selection or migration. The simulated genome consisted of five 1 Morgan chromosomes. Ten thousand loci were positioned equally across each chromosome  resulting in 50 000 loci across the genome. In generation 0  all loci were set to be bi-allelic with allele frequencies equal to 0.5 and alleles coded as “1” and “2”. Recurrent mutations were simulated at a rate of 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 per locus per meiosis in the subsequent generations. Recombinations per chromosome were sampled from a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the length of the chromosome in Morgan and were randomly placed along the chromosome assuming a uniform distribution. Generation 2000 was used as the base population (G). In G  the average linkage disequilibrium (LD) (±SD) between neighboring loci was r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.26 (±0.34) and the allele frequency distribution followed a U-shaped distribution  with 30.6% of the loci fixed. For the analysis in G and onwards  markers and QTL were chosen among all segregating loci and the simulations were programmed using R []. For chromosomes 1 to 4  among all simulated loci  every second locus was used as a potential marker. The remaining loci were used as potential QTL. Potential markers with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05 in G were discarded. From the 5000 potential QTL  a specified number of QTL were selected  depending on the scenario (Table ). For each QTL  the allele coded as “1” was used as the favorable allele. Potential QTL that had a frequency of 0.01  0.1 or 0.3 (±2% of defined frequency) for allele “1” were used as QTL. These three sets of low initial allele frequencies were chosen in order to be as far as possible from fixation and to observe the loss of favorable alleles with different initial allele frequencies. Rare alleles were considered as those having a favorable allele frequency of 0.01. The positions of QTL were varied per replicate  but the same base population was used for all four selection criteria within each replicate. Potential QTL that were not used as QTL (with MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01) were used as linked neutral loci (LN). These loci were assumed to have no effects on the trait and were therefore not used for selection. No QTL were simulated on chromosome 5 and 2000 loci with a MAF<U+2009>><U+2009>0.01 were randomly chosen from the 10 000 simulated loci on this chromosome and used as selectively neutral loci (SN). In descendant generations  genotypes with respect to QTL  markers  LN and SN were sampled according to the mendelian inheritance principles allowing for recombination. The simulation of recombination was the same as for the historical population. The considered traits were standardized to have a mean of 0 and variance equal to the defined heritability for animals in G (Table ). Generations 1 to 25 were simulated without mutations. Each QTL was assumed to have the same additive genetic variance  so the allele substitution effect at QTL  was set equal to:   where  is the heritability   is the number of QTL  and  is the frequency of allele “1” of QTL []. No dominance or epistatic effects were included. The true breeding value (TBV) for each animal was obtained by summing the allelic effects at each QTL. The environmental terms were drawn from a random normal distribution (0 <U+2009>1<U+2009>-<U+2009>h) and were added to the TBV to obtain the phenotypic record of each animal. Environmental variance was kept constant through the simulations  regardless of changes in additive genetic variance. The methods for simulating TBV and phenotypic records were identical in each generation. Selection on the different criteria started from G and was continued for 25 generations. In each generation  the best 50 males and 50 females among 400 candidates were selected based on the selection criterion. Selected individuals were randomly mated and each pair produced eight offspring with equal sex ratio. Breeding values were estimated for all individuals from G onwards using the four methods of interest. For PS  selection was simply on the individual’s own phenotype. For BLUP  the pedigree and phenotype for G and G were assumed to be known. For GBLUP and BL  the marker genotype and phenotype for G and G were assumed to be known. The use of information of only the two generations was chosen in order to allow a fair comparison between different selection criteria and to reduce computation time. The following general structure of models [] was used to predict EBV with BLUP and GBLUP for individuals in generation G: where  is the vector of phenotypic records from G and G   is the overall mean   is a vector of 1’s   is an incidence matrix for allocating phenotypes to breeding values   is a vector of breeding values to be estimated  and  is a vector of residuals assumed   where  is an identity matrix. The true breeding values for BLUP were assumed to follow a normal distribution   where  is the numerator relationship matrix based on the pedigree. BLUP was performed by solving the mixed model equations for the animal model given the inverse of the numerator relationship matrix    which was calculated based on individuals in G and their sires and dams in G With GBLUP  true breeding values were assumed to follow a normal distribution   where  is the genetic relationship matrix based on the marker data []. GBLUP was performed by solving the mixed model equations for the animal model given . A BL model was built according to the description in [  ]. The breeding value g for individual  was defined as a parametric linear regression on marker covariates  of the form   such that   where  is the phenotypic record of an individual from G or G   is the intercept  and {} are the marker effects ( =1 2 ….  p markers). Gaussian assumptions for model residuals were used  i.e. the joint distribution of model residuals was assumed to follow . The likelihood function yields: where  is a normal density for random variable  centered at  and with variance . The BL assigns a double exponential distribution to all marker effects  conditional on a regularization parameter   centered at zero and with marker-specific variance: . The prior distribution for the residual variance was an inverse-chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom and scale parameter 1. The rate and shape parameters for  were set to 1<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and 0.6  respectively  following the guideline of []. The marker effects were estimated using the BL described in []  as implemented in the BLR package of R []. Further details on the model and algorithms can be found in [  ]. The Gibbs sampler was run for 1500 iterations and the first 500 iterations were discarded as burn-in. The summary statistics for each of the scenarios were based on 100 replicated simulations. Allele frequency changes at all loci  genetic variance  accuracy of selection and inbreeding under all selection criteria were calculated for each generation and were used for comparisons. A favorable allele was considered fixed when <U+2009>=<U+2009>1 and lost when <U+2009>=<U+2009>0. Allele frequency changes at all loci in generation t (<U+0394>) were scaled by a factor  in order to standardize <U+0394> relative to the standard deviation of the frequencies. The <U+0394> of fixed and lost alleles were not used in the analysis. Changes in allele frequencies at LN and SN were compared to quantify the hitch-hiking effect  i.e. whether the evolution of a selected locus (QTL) may alter the dynamics of many closely linked loci in comparison to neutral loci []. Allele frequency changes resulting from sampling were random  in the sense that their directions were unpredictable  but their magnitude can be predicted in terms of the variance of the changes []. Therefore  the variance rather than the mean of allele frequency changes was used for analysis. The level of hitch-hiking for LN was measured by dividing the variance of allele frequency changes for LN by the variance of allele frequency changes for SN . The numerator (<U+0394>) is the measure of drift due to indirect selection and sampling  whereas the denominator (<U+0394>) is the measure of drift only due to sampling. Values greater than 1 indicate a hitch-hiking effect. Genetic variance was calculated from the variance of TBV within generation. Accuracy was calculated as the correlation between the selection criteria  i.e. phenotype or estimated (G)EBV  with TBV for the G animals. Pedigree-based inbreeding coefficients in G  F  were estimated with the inbreeding function in the GeneticsPed package [] of R  using the algorithm by Meuwissen and Luo [] and all pedigree information from G to G. Individuals in G were assumed to be unrelated. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) were detected for each animal by PLINK []  using a sliding window of 10  25 or 50 consecutive markers across the genome. No heterozygous marker genotype was allowed within a given window. A map file was created from the location of all loci on the chromosome and the unit was directly converted from centi-Morgan to base-pairs (1 cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>10 bp). If the gap between two consecutive homozygous markers was greater than 1 Mb  the ROH was split into two. Inbreeding coefficients estimated by ROH (F) were calculated for each animal as the fraction of the genome covered by markers involved in ROH. The rate of inbreeding () for F or F was calculated as   which was derived from the equation in []  where F and F are the inbreeding coefficients in G and in the base population (F). In addition  the mendelian selection differential was calculated by the method of Pedersen et al. []. The mendelian sampling term was calculated as the difference between an animal’s TBV and the mean TBV of its parents. The mendelian selection differential was then calculated as the difference between the mean mendelian sampling term of the selected animals and that of all animals within a generation. Comparisons of rates of inbreeding and mendelian selection differentials between scenarios were performed using Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Figure  shows that in general  favourable QTL allele frequencies (p) increased significantly faster when the number of QTL was lower and heritability was higher. Genomic information used by BL and GBLUP increased the average frequency of favourable QTL alleles  p  only marginally compared to BLUP and PS at higher heritability  while the differences in p between all selection criteria were more pronounced at lower heritability. Results from the  scenarios were focused on to demonstrate these differences (Figure ).  Note that the scale of the y-axis is not the same for scenarios with different numbers of QTL.   <U+2009>: favourable QTL allele frequency changes (<U+2206>p) in      scenarios; : genetic variance among selection candidates in each generation in      scenarios; : accuracy of predicting breeding values in      scenarios. The difference in favourable QTL allele frequencies  p  between selection criteria was largest in the  scenario  where BL on average fixed all favourable alleles approximately 10 generations earlier than PS (Figure ). In the  scenario  BL showed approximately 2% higher p at the plateau than GBLUP. The discrepancy in p between selection criteria declined as the number of QTL increased. GS (GBLUP and BL) moved the favourable alleles towards fixation faster than BLUP  and selection on BLUP showed faster fixation than PS as shown in Figure . The discrepancy in changes in allele frequencies  <U+2206>p  between selection criteria also reduced as the number of QTL increased (Figure A  B and C). In the  scenario  BL performed better than GBLUP in most of the generations. Phenotypic selection showed the lowest <U+2206>p until G. After G the results were no longer comparable since most QTL were fixed and resulted in a large standard error in <U+2206>p. For the other scenarios  <U+2206>p was stable and PS resulted in a lower <U+2206>p compared to all other criteria. Genetic variance across 25 generations was affected by the number of QTL controlling the trait (Figure D  E and F). All selection criteria showed a faster initial increase  a higher peak and a faster final loss in genetic variance when the number of QTL was lower. The faster initial increase in variance was due to a rapid rise in p given an easier identification of animals with a favourable combination of alleles when the number of QTL was small. The higher peak with a smaller number of QTL resulted from all QTL reaching intermediate allele frequencies at the same time with few QTL  while with more QTL it took more generations for all p to move past 0.5 (Figure ). The loss in genetic variance occurred due to the rapid fixation of favourable alleles. In all presented scenarios  the genetic variance for PS initially showed a slower increase and subsequently reached a higher peak and decreased more slowly compared to other selection criteria  followed by BLUP and BL. GBLUP showed the lowest peak and the most significant decay in genetic variance. The pattern of accuracy was also influenced by the number of QTL for a given heritability (Figure G  H and I). Accuracy in a given generation depended on the genetic variance that was maintained. Similar to genetic variance  all selection criteria also showed a faster initial gain  a higher peak and a faster final loss in the accuracy when the number of QTL was lower. In the  scenario  BL showed a higher peak in accuracy (0.72) relative to other criteria  including GBLUP (0.67). After the peak  the decay in accuracy for BL and GBLUP was greater than for other criteria and accuracy became lower than accuracy for PS after G due to fixation of favourable QTL alleles. In the  and the  scenarios  BL showed a slightly higher accuracy than GBLUP after six and eight generations  respectively  partly due to a higher genetic variance. The loss of favourable QTL alleles was significantly influenced by the number of QTL and heritability (Figure ). Generally  the number of favourable alleles lost was greater when the number of QTL was higher. For instance  in the  scenario  where each QTL had a larger effect  less than 5% of the favourable alleles were lost after 25 generations for all selection criteria. This loss increased to 21% for PS and to 35% for BLUP in the  scenario. It was also found that to reach the same average level of p  a lower heritability led to a greater loss of favourable alleles during the process. Moreover  for all selection criteria and scenarios  a greater loss of favourable alleles occurred in the first few generations and this slowed down thereafter.                                                      For the  scenarios  BL performed the best among the selection criteria in terms of maintaining favourable QTL  while BLUP performed the worst. For the other scenarios  BLUP was still distinguished from the other selection criteria by having on average the highest loss of favourable alleles. Bayesian Lasso showed an advantage for both maintaining more favourable alleles and increasing the average p. This result could partly explain why BL had a higher final average frequency of favourable alleles and maintained more genetic variance than GBLUP. For PS  however  its low improvement in average frequency of favourable alleles compared to all other criteria was compensated by it having the smallest loss of favourable alleles. The difference in the loss of favourable alleles between BLUP  GBLUP and BL became smaller at a higher heritability. In addition  the loss of rare favourable alleles followed the pattern for all favourable alleles (results not shown). In presenting the hitch-hiking effect  only the generations in which QTL were not yet fixed were considered because linked loci would no longer have a hitch-hiking effect if the QTL was fixed []. The first QTL was fixed by generation 8 for the most extreme scenarios  i.e. with BLUP  GBLUP and BL in the  scenario. Thus  allele frequency changes for LN in the first eight generations were used for analysis in order to allow systematic comparisons for all selection criteria and all scenarios. Figure  provides information on (<U+0394>) for different selection criteria for all scenarios. Heritability had an impact on (<U+0394>) but the number of QTL did not. The value of (<U+0394>) was reduced with a higher heritability for BLUP  GBLUP and BL  regardless of the number of QTL. However  with PS  (<U+0394>) increased with heritability. For all scenarios  BLUP showed the highest (<U+0394>)  followed by GBLUP  BL and PS.                                                      Figure  illustrates the relationship between the hitch-hiking effect and the distance between LN and its nearest QTL and shows a distinct peak in the level of hitch-hiking in the vicinity of the QTL for all scenarios and for all selection criteria. This means that a linkage drag existed around the selected loci  even when the accuracy of selection and the allele substitution effect were relatively low. The amount of hitch-hiking declined as the distance of the LN to a QTL increased.  The hitch-hiking effect was presented as the variance of allele frequency changes at linked loci relative to the variance of allele frequency changes at unlinked neutral loci  as a function of distance from the QTL (in cM); allele frequency changes of all linked loci were calculated and sorted by their distance in cM to the closest QTL; subsequently we performed a sliding window of 40 000 records of variance of allele frequency changes at each linked locus; note that the scale of both axes differ for scenarios with different numbers of QTL. The amount of hitch-hiking across the entire genome was affected by the number of QTL and heritability (Figure ). In general  a higher heritability and a lower number of QTL (i.e. a higher allele substitution effect) could result in a stronger hitch-hiking effect surrounding the QTL. For all scenarios  GBLUP showed the largest hitch-hiking effect  followed by BL  BLUP and PS. For example  the ratio of (<U+0394>) to (<U+0394>) at the peak ranged from 5.51 for GBLUP and from 5.28 for PS in the  scenarios to 1.28 for GBLUP and 1.11 for PS in . For GBLUP  BL and BLUP  (<U+0394>) was significantly higher than (<U+0394>) across the entire genome for the  scenario  which implies that even at a distance of more than 75 cM  selection at the QTL dragged blocks of the chromosome more than at random. For PS  in the  scenarios  selection at the QTL only dragged a block of less than 50 cM. In the other scenarios  the order of selection criteria according to the level of hitch-hiking was the same. Comparisons of rates of inbreeding were also made based on the first eight generations (Table ). Results showed that <U+2206>F was significantly influenced by heritability for BLUP  GBLUP and PS. A higher heritability resulted in a reduction in <U+2206>F for BLUP and GBLUP but an increase in <U+2206>F for PS. While increasing the number of QTL decreased <U+2206>F in most cases  this effect was not significant. BLUP showed higher pedigree inbreeding than all other selection criteria  followed by GBLUP  BL and finally PS. For the  scenario for instance  <U+2206>F was 9% higher for BLUP than for GBLUP. The cut-off length for calculating ROH did not have a significant effect on <U+2206>F. Thus  only <U+2206>F was included in Table . For all scenarios and all selection criteria  <U+2206>F was significantly higher than <U+2206>F  except for PS  for which the difference was not significant for the<U+2009>=<U+2009> scenarios. For all criteria except BL  <U+2206>F was significantly higher for the  scenarios than for the<U+2009>=<U+2009> scenarios. The difference between <U+2206>F and <U+2206>F tended to be smaller with a higher number of QTL. In addition  in any generation  the value of the inbreeding coefficient measured with a cut-off length of 50 SNPs (F) was closer to F as compared to F and F (results not shown). This result was as expected because F captures more recent inbreeding within the pedigree. The ranking of scenarios based <U+2206>F  however  was different from that based on <U+2206>F  e.g.  <U+2206>F was even higher for GBLUP than for BLUP in the  scenarios. The difference between <U+2206>F and <U+2206>F for BL was also greater than for PS  but relatively smaller than for GBLUP. For instance  <U+2206>F was approximately 10% to 15% higher than <U+2206>F for the  scenario. This suggests that the rate of inbreeding measured by pedigree does not accurately reflect the rate of true inbreeding for GS. In G  the average mendelian selection differential at the QTL was lowest for BLUP and highest for BL  except for the  scenario. Mendelian selection differential was smaller with a higher number of QTL and a lower heritability  but the difference in mendelian selection differential between the  and  scenarios was not significant. The results of this study demonstrate that directional selection on favorable alleles can reduce heterozygosity of loci that are closely linked to one or more QTL. The reduction of genetic diversity surrounding the QTL is caused by the effect of “hitch-hiking”  which was first termed by Maynard Smith and Haigh []. Our results indicate that with a limited population size  inbreeding is not only caused by random genetic drift but also by direct selection on the QTL. Hitch-hiking due to linkage gradually removed linked neutral polymorphisms from the population  thus also acting as an important mechanism to reduce the genetic diversity and further increase the rate of inbreeding. This mechanism appeared more substantial under GS  which contributes to a large difference between the rate of inbreeding measured by pedigree and by ROH (<U+2206>F and <U+2206>F) for GS. Furthermore  the discrepancy between <U+2206>F and <U+2206>F greatly depended on the number of QTL. In the current study  random genetic drift with selection on the different criteria was measured by the variance of gene frequency changes for selectively neutral loci  (<U+0394>)  which were simulated on chromosome 5 (Figure ). The loci on chromosome 5 were in linkage equilibrium (LE) with the QTL since the QTL were on different chromosomes  so the value of (<U+0394>) reflects the impact of genetic drift due to the emphasis on selection of families. The results showed that at lower heritability  i.e. 0.05  genetic drift was more pronounced for GS and BLUP because the emphasis on sib information in these selection criteria was high  so co-selection of relatives increased as the heritability decreased  in contrast to PS []. The results also showed that GBLUP led to greater genetic drift  more loss of favorable alleles and higher inbreeding than BL. A possible explanation is that  compared to BL  GBLUP is more affected by family relationships among individuals  which is similar to traditional BLUP. Habier et al. [] conducted a simulation study in which all markers were in LE with 10 QTL and showed that  with sufficiently dense markers  the accuracy of GEBV from GBLUP was only marginally smaller than the accuracy from BLUP  which suggested that GBLUP also puts substantial emphasis on genetic relationships. Bayesian methods  however  captured much less genetic relationship than GBLUP with dense markers []. Table  also showed that BL is less sensitive  with regard to inbreeding and loss of favorable alleles  to the heritability than GBLUP  which indicates that it is less sensitive to family relationships. The current study also showed that in most scenarios  BL resulted in a higher mendelian selection differential than GBLUP and BLUP  indicating that BL had a greater ability to capture the within-family differentiation. The greater genetic drift with GBLUP led to a larger chance of losing favorable alleles and greater pedigree inbreeding  as shown in Figure  and Table . A greater loss of favorable alleles from GBLUP than from BL may also be attributed to the different weight on the rare alleles for prediction. In the current study  the assumption that all QTL had equal variance in the simulation resulted in rare alleles to have larger allele substitution effects. GBLUP results in greater shrinkage towards zero for the effects of markers that have a low minor allele frequency  even though they had large effects []. The alleles at these markers will therefore have a larger risk of being lost and contribute to inbreeding with GBLUP compared to BL. Another important finding was that more favorable alleles were lost when the number of QTL was greater  likely because selection pressure on each QTL is smaller and therefore  drift becomes relatively more important. Inbreeding results from drift because alleles become IBD. In fact  the variance of the change in allele frequency at a locus in one generation is (<U+0394>)<U+2009><U+2009><U+2009>*<U+2009><U+2009>*<U+2009>(1<U+2009>-<U+2009>)  where  is the inbreeding coefficient measured by IBD []. Provided that changes in allele frequencies were adjusted by their standard deviation  the variance of changes in allele frequencies serves as a good indicator of inbreeding. Inbreeding predicted from pedigree  <U+2206>F  assumes that all alleles are selectively neutral  which was valid for the markers on chromosome 5. Therefore  the conclusion from results of <U+2206>F was consistent with results obtained from (<U+0394>)  that is  <U+2206>F increased with (<U+0394>). In the current study  the level of hitch-hiking was measured by the ratio of (<U+0394>) to (<U+0394>). Based on this ratio being greater than 1  Figure  indicates that linked neutral loci yielded a higher IBD than neutral loci  in particular for loci in the vicinity of QTL. This also implies that the genetic variance at a QTL can be explained by loci (markers) near the QTL and under the condition that a higher LD exists between the QTL and the adjacent loci  as opposed to by loci that are more distant. Hitch-hiking can be considerable if the QTL effect is large. For example  Pedersen et al. [] suggested that the hitch-hiking effect of positive selection on a single QTL with a large effect can span up to 1 Morgan  which is consistent with our findings for BLUP and GS but does not hold for PS  for which the hitch-hiking did not impact drift on the entire chromosome. Moreover  when a trait is affected by more QTL  a significant hitch-hiking occurred around each QTL  but the proportion of the genome involved in hitch-hiking was reduced. A higher accuracy of any selection criterion due to a higher heritability caused a higher peak and steeper slope of hitch-hiking. The most likely reasons for these findings are that  first  the selection pressure for the QTL is stronger with a higher accuracy  and second  a higher accuracy leads to faster fixation of the QTL and thus LD between adjacent loci will be broken down with a more rapid speed relative to a lower accuracy. This implies that strength of selection on the QTL may be an essential factor for the level of hitch-hiking observed for each selection criteria. This is consistent with the findings of Kaplan et al. []  who developed a model for hitch-hiking and stated that in regions of low crossing-over  strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes compared to that expected under a neutral model. Our results show that hitch-hiking was greater with GS due to higher accuracy of selection on the QTL  as stated above. Another reason might be that instead of directly selecting the QTL  selection acts on markers in LD with the QTL  which results in more IBD as well as larger ROH segments across the genome. Figure  shows that the hitch-hiking was more marked with GBLUP than with BL  probably because of the assumption of GBLUP that all markers contribute equally to the observed variation. Habier et al. [] reported that  with 1000 markers in LD with 10 QTL  GBLUP fitted 100% of SNPs when predicting GEBV  while only a small subset of markers (1.82% to 5.23%) were fitted in Bayesian methods. In our study  BL provides an example to illustrate in terms of an a priori distribution in which each marker was weighted differently  so that a limited number of markers were used to capture the QTL. With a few QTL  the assumption for BL is more appropriate than for GBLUP. BL was able to identify the position of a large QTL and only a few SNPs near the QTL were required for prediction  whereas in GBLUP  the effect of a QTL was spread over a larger number of markers. Therefore  with a limited number of QTL the IBD peaks were lower with BL than with GBLUP  leading to a lower overall hitch-hiking and genomic inbreeding  as seen from <U+2206>F (Table ). If the genetic model resembles the polygenic model  this conclusion might not hold. For instance  based on a simulation using 1000 QTL  Sonesson et al. [] found that the Bayesian method resulted in higher genomic inbreeding than GBLUP. However  in agreement with our study  Sonesson et al. [] found that under truncation selection  genomic inbreeding was substantially greater than pedigree inbreeding  especially with GS. The genetic variance maintained over generations differed between the BLUP and GS scenarios in two aspects: in BLUP  fixation of QTL was slower and genetic drift was more severe due to increased co-selection of relatives as parents. For GS  the loss of favourable alleles was attributed to genetic drift as well as to low LD between QTL and markers. For GBLUP  fixation of QTL seemed to outweigh genetic drift  in particular with a small number of QTL  resulting in a faster reduction in the genetic variance than with more QTL. Moreover  our results indicate that with a limited number of QTL affecting the trait  BL ensured a larger long-term response  as shown by the favourable allele frequencies  due to the fact that BL maintained more genetic variance. It should be noted that several aspects of the simulation lack realism and might affect the results. First only a limited number of QTL were simulated but in reality most of the traits  e.g. human height  are likely to be polygenic. Pedigree inbreeding might be a good estimate of true inbreeding under the infinitesimal model  because the discrepancy between pedigree and true inbreeding over all QTL decreases with the number of QTL []. Therefore  it would be interesting to investigate the hitch-hiking effect with much more QTL in further studies  since the suggestion that pedigree inbreeding serves as a good estimator of true inbreeding is difficult to verity from the current results. The second limitation was that all QTL were simulated to explain equal variance in order to maximize the effective number of QTL. However  in reality  QTL effects will show more variability []. The difference in the loss of favourable alleles between GBLUP and BL might be smaller if the QTL effects followed a gamma distribution  since GBLUP is expected to lose fewer rare alleles than BL. However  with the assumption of equal variance  the allelic effects of markers were more similar to each other  so that the hitch-hiking is similar across the QTL. Moreover  if the effects of QTL are too different  it will also be difficult to see the pattern of hitch-hiking on the basis of the distance of any QTL to all its linked loci. Another limitation is that the initial favourable allele frequencies were considered to be smaller than 0.3. The explanations for this choice are that: first  the purpose of the study was to observe the hitch-hiking effects of the QTL. If the QTL become fixed rapidly  the linked loci will no longer experience hitch-hiking. This will happen within a few generations when the number of QTL is low  which will generate less replicates for hitch-hiking results and also make it difficult to compare scenarios. Second  the whole process of the change in gene frequencies can be observed if the initial frequencies for the favourable alleles are lower. Third  favourable alleles with lower initial frequencies are expected to have a larger chance of being lost  which was of interest in this study. To test whether the initial allele frequencies affected the final conclusions  the simulation was also run using QTL with minor allele frequencies greater than 0.01 (See Additional file : Figure S1). In this scenario  the difference in the favourable allele frequencies in any generation is smaller compared to the scenario in which the favourable allele has a lower initial frequency  especially at a higher heritability. It was also shown that the ranking of methods based on the loss of favourable alleles was not greatly affected by the initial frequencies of favourable QTL alleles but  in general  the loss was substantially reduced with a higher initial frequency (See Additional file : Figure S2). In our study  we did not take differences in recombination rates between sexes into account []. In addition  recombinations were sampled from a Poisson distribution and were randomly placed along the chromosome assuming a uniform distribution  but in reality  recombination patterns are rarely uniform across the (human) genome []. Non-uniformity of recombination rates (hot spots and cold spots) along a chromosome can have an impact on the pattern of LD  e.g. LD blocks. It is unclear how recombination patterns would affect the result of hitch-hiking  but previous results have shown that positive selection can result in a distinctive footprint that can extend across very large segments  even in regions with high recombination rates []. Moreover  we only simulated a single trait for each scenario  and the closely linked loci did not affect any other trait. In reality  the closely linked loci might be deleterious mutations that negatively affect a trait. For example  Chun et al. [] reported that  in humans  within genomic regions that show evidence of hitch-hiking by adaptive substitutions  there were fewer neutral but a similar number of deleterious SNPs compared to other genomic regions. They also found that disease alleles within hitch-hiking regions can cause auto-immune disorders  cancers and mental disorders. This implies that for animals  positive selection on traits of interest could potentially increase the frequencies of linked deleterious alleles. Therefore  the footprint of GS must be taken into account. Sonesson et al. [] used optimum contribution selection and showed that this method can spread the selection pressure quite evenly over many loci in order to control the increase in overall IBD. Another method would be to weight marker effects by the inverse of their allele frequencies  as suggested by Goddard []  such that specific emphasis on the QTL with a large effect would be avoided. Then  the selection intensity can be desirably spread across the genomic regions  which can reduce the footprint of selection and maximise long-term genetic gain []. In conclusion  signatures of selection play an important role in the variation observed at the genome-wide level. Neutral variation can be shaped to a great extent by hitch-hiking effects that are associated with selection  rather than just by genetic drift. The hitch-hiking effect is a key factor that leads to large differences between pedigree inbreeding and genomic inbreeding  especially with genomic selection. When inbreeding was measured by pedigree information  selection on genomic BLUP EBV resulted in lower levels of inbreeding than selection on phenotype BLUP EBV  but this did not always apply when inbreeding was measured by runs of homozygosity. Bayesian Lasso was found to result in less genetic drift  less loss of favorable alleles and less pedigree and genomic inbreeding when the number of QTL was up to 100. When implementing long-term genomic selection  genomic control of inbreeding is essential to reduce the considerable hitch-hiking effects that are associated with genomic selection  regardless of the prediction model used.

We apply a new marker system based on nuclear (n)DNA loci to present a novel view of the phylogeny of  representatives and we compare it with the mtDNA-based phylogeny.MethodsTwenty-two nDNA loci were sequenced for 76 individuals of the brown trout complex:  (Danubian  Atlantic  Adriatic  Mediterranean and Duero mtDNA lineages)   (marble trout)   (softmouth trout)  and  (Ohrid belvica or belushka). Sequences were phylogenetically analyzed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. The divergence time of the major clades was estimated using the program BEAST.ResultsThe existence of five genetic units i.e.        and the  complex  including its major phylogenetic lineages was confirmed.

We apply a new marker system based on nuclear (n)DNA loci to present a novel view of the phylogeny of  representatives and we compare it with the mtDNA-based phylogeny. Twenty-two nDNA loci were sequenced for 76 individuals of the brown trout complex:  (Danubian  Atlantic  Adriatic  Mediterranean and Duero mtDNA lineages)   (marble trout)   (softmouth trout)  and  (Ohrid belvica or belushka). Sequences were phylogenetically analyzed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. The divergence time of the major clades was estimated using the program BEAST. The existence of five genetic units i.e.        and the  complex  including its major phylogenetic lineages was confirmed. Contrary to previous observations   was found to be sister to the  complex and the  clade rather than to the  clade. Reticulate evolution of  was confirmed and a time for its pre-glacial origin suggested.  was found to be a separate species as  and . Relationships among lineages within the  complex were weakly supported and remain largely unresolved. Nuclear DNA-based results showed a fairly good match with the phylogeny of  inferred from mtDNA analyses. The comparison of nDNA and mtDNA data revealed at least four cases of mitochondrial–nuclear DNA discordance observed that were all confined to the Adriatic basin of the Western Balkans. Together with the well-known extensive morphological and genetic variability of Balkan trouts  this observation highlights an interesting and variegated evolutionary history of  in this area. Due to the high level of phenotypic diversity recorded in trout species  the classification of the genus  is still a matter of discussion. According to a recent taxonomic evaluation []  about 30 species have been identified  which is in marked contrast to the two-species view (e.g. [])  which was held for many years and which recognized only  and  (e.g. [  ]). Genetically  representatives of the genus   with the exception of   are usually regarded as members of the  complex  which includes five mitochondrial (mt)DNA lineages named after the basins where they were first found: Danubian (DA)  Atlantic (AT)  Adriatic (AD) and Mediterranean (ME) []  and the drainage Duero (DU; []). A separate lineage   (MA)  corresponds to the marble trout () sampled in the Po and Soca river drainages. Although a consensus has been reached on the existence of these different phylogeographic lineages  the relationships among the lineages are unclear and result in different interpretations of their evolution (e.g. [–]). Moreover  a number of studies have shown that some lineages are also naturally present outside of their described geographical range. For example  the AD and ME lineages are present respectively in the Iberian Peninsula [] and in the Adriatic basin []  while the AT lineage has been found in Sicily [] and is also apparently naturally present in the Danubian drainage in northern Austria []. In addition  MA haplotypes have been detected in brown trout [  ] and AD haplotypes in the southern population of marble trout  from the Neretva and Skadar ( in Albanian) basins []. From a taxonomic view  mtDNA lineages have not been validated  with the exception of   despite the inconsistency reported for marble trout  which is regarded either as a separate species (e.g.  [  –]) or a member of the  complex [  ]. Besides  and the  complex  there are two less well known but phenotypically highly distinct members of :  (Ohrid belvica;  in Albanian) and  (softmouth trout)  both of which have been ambiguously classified despite their distinct morphology  and their position within Salmonidae has been rearranged on numerous occasions (see Snoj et al. [] for review). On the basis of molecular data  these two species have been positioned in the genus [–]. While  has turned out to be undisputedly sister to the  complex  the exact position of  has yet to be resolved; depending on the molecular markers used and model of evolution applied   is assigned either to the  complex or as sister to [  ]. Although several other  species have been described from the Balkans []  the systematics of the majority of these species is still uncertain []. Therefore  in addition to  and   we will refer to the taxonomic classification of only those taxa for which separation has been previously described at the molecular level i.e.     ; for the other taxa  we use the designation brown trout  complex. Some phylogeny studies of  have also included nuclear (n)DNA single loci but were either subsequently reported to be phylogenetically non-informative due to selection pressure ([  ]; []) or screened in only a few  taxa ([]; []; []) with no intention of resolving their phylogenetic position within the genus. Phylogeny studies using other sequences of nDNA in  have not been undertaken and  therefore  no comprehensive nDNA information is available to verify the conclusions based on the analysis of the control region (CR) mtDNA. The discrepancy that exists between gene trees and a species tree  and also between nDNA and mtDNA trees  is well known [–] and is especially problematic in closely related species or those with large population sizes []  a situation commonly observed in . With the development of novel techniques  it is now becoming easier to collect data on multiple unlinked nuclear gene loci and multiple individuals per species [–]. In addition  new analytical methods have emerged to evaluate species trees  based either on concatenated datasets and previously used methods to construct phylogenies (maximum likelihood  parsimony  Bayesian analyses) or on the coalescent theory  which analyzes genetic loci individually and constructs a species tree from the results of independent analyses of individual loci []. In order to resolve phylogeographic and taxonomic inconsistencies in   predominantly in trouts of the Western Balkans  and to avoid misinterpretations due to possible discrepancies between gene and species trees  we have applied a new marker system based on a larger number of independent and neutral nDNA loci than that previously used and which are designed to distinguish purebred trouts from their hybrids []. A total of 76 individuals were analyzed (Table   Figure )  including marble trout  (northern and southern populations  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>20)  brown trout   (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>42  phylogeographic lineages DA  AT  AD  ME and DU  hereafter referred to as  complex)  Ohrid belvica (belushka)  (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2)  softmouth trout  (from the rivers Neretva  Vrljika  Jadro and Zeta  N<U+2009>=<U+2009>8) and as out-groups Atlantic salmon  (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) and Sakhalin Taimen  (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2). Sequence data from 36 individuals (18 marble trout  12 brown trout  four dentex and two Atlantic salmon) were recovered from a previous study ([]; for Genbank accession numbers see Table ). Data on the phylogeographic lineage and introgression status of all analyzed samples were obtained from mtDNA and microsatellite markers tests in previous studies [      ].  Map of Europe and the western Balkans showing the locations of the 36 sampling sites. Sampling site numbers correspond to those (NS) in Table . DNA was isolated from fin clips conserved in 96% ethanol  using the high-salt extraction technique of Miller et al. []. Twenty-two nuclear regions were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers and conditions are described in Pustovrh et al. [] and PCR were performed in 25 µL reaction mixtures according to []. Amplified DNA fragments were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Approximately 100 ng of purified PCR product was used in cycle sequencing reactions following BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing protocols (Applied Biosystems). The amplified  fluorescently labeled and terminated DNA was salt-precipitated and analyzed with an ABI 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer. All newly determined sequences were submitted to Genbank (see Table ). Sequences of all 22 loci for each individual sample were combined in the same order as reported in Table  and aligned using the default parameters in CLUSTAL-W []. Genotypes of all loci in each of the analyzed samples are reported [See Additional file : Table S1]. All loci were tested for positive selection (HA: dN<U+2009>><U+2009>dS) by the Nei–Gojobori method [] using MEGA version 4 []. A phylogenetic tree based on all the individuals analyzed was constructed using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods. ML was performed as implemented in GARLI Version 0.96b8 []. To avoid over partitioning and yet still effectively deal with heterogeneity  each locus was used as a criterion to define a partition (locus). Prior model selection for each partition was determined using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) calculated in jMODELTEST v 3.06 [] in conjunction with PAUP (models for each partition are listed in Table ). For analysis  2000 bootstrap replicates were carried out to identify the best partitioning scheme. Analysis was performed with the settings recommended by Zwickl [] and the runs were set for an unlimited number of generations and automatic termination following 20 000 generations without a meaningful (ln L increase of 0.01) change in score. For BI  MrBayes 3.1.2 [] was used. Prior model selection for each partition was determined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) calculated in MrModeltest 2.3 [] in conjunction with PAUP (Table ). Random starting trees were used and four Markov chains were run for one million generations: nucmodel<U+2009>=<U+2009>4 by 4; nruns<U+2009>=<U+2009>2; tree-sampling frequencies of 1 in 100 (10 000 trees saved). Convergence was assessed by examining the cumulative posterior probabilities of clades using the “Are We There Yet?” online program (AWTY; []). To address inter-specific phylogenetic relationships within   the method for species tree reconstruction  implemented in *BEAST v1.7.2. []  was also used. The program determines the likelihood of gene trees in a given species tree to find the most likely containing species tree for multiple genes sampled from individuals across a set of closely related species. It uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to average over the tree space  so that each tree is weighted proportionally to its posterior probability. All settings were entered in BEAUti v1.7.0  a graphical software package that allows creation of BEAST XML input files. Each genetic region (locus) was partitioned using BIC calculated in jMODELTEST v 3.06 (Table ). Time-measured phylogeny using the relaxed clock model [] and tree model were set as unlinked for all partitions. All molecular clock estimates for the gene regions were examined using the uncorrelated lognormal model. The operational taxonomic units (OTU) that were compared corresponded with the clades defined on the basis of individual trees constructed in GARLI as described above (see Table ). Using CIPRES Science Gateway V. 3.3 []  a public resource for inference of large phylogenetic trees  the same XML file was run for seven independent simultaneous runs of 300 millions generations sampled once every 30 000 trees. After analyzing each run separately  the program Tracer v1.5 (distributed with BEAST) was used and the first 30 millions generations were discarded as burn-in samples. A summary tree was created for each run using TreeAnnotator v1.5.3 (distributed with BEAST). The separate log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner v1.5.3 (distributed with BEAST). The combined log file was analyzed in Tracer 1.5 to ensure that effective sample sizes were large enough. Combined trees were analyzed with TreeAnnotator 1.5.3 and a summary tree produced and viewed in FigTree version 1.3.1 (). Each gene tree generated with BEAST was also analyzed and compared to the reference species tree. This was assessed by K tree score implemented in the program Ktreedist [] that measures overall differences in the relative branch length and topology of two phylogenetic trees (two trees with very different relative branch lengths will get a high K score while two trees that follow a similar between-lineage rate variation will get a low K score  regardless of the overall rates in both trees; by comparing two trees you can choose the one that better follows the overall shape of a given reference tree []. The time of divergence between major clades within  since they last shared a common ancestor was estimated using the Relaxed Bayesian molecular clock model in BEAST v.1.7.2. The first prior was chosen to set the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of  and  complex  which  on the basis of Cyt sequences was estimated to be 4 MYA (million years ago) [] (prior was set to 4 MY (million years) with standard deviation (SD)<U+2009>=<U+2009>±1 MY.) Another prior was chosen to set the time when the DA and AD–ME clades last shared a common ancestor. It is generally considered that the Mediterranean and Danubian basins separated about 700 000 years ago  and thus the prior was set to 0.7 MY with SD<U+2009>=<U+2009>±0.2 MY [  ]. All the other settings were the same as for the *BEAST analysis described above and median values and 95% highest posterior density intervals of the corresponding TMRCA were obtained. The results were analyzed with Tracer v 1.5. Final alignment was made for 76 samples and 22 nuclear loci (Tables  and ). Some loci could not be amplified in the out-group species (four in  and 10 in ). When excluding the out-group species  the final alignment consisted of ca. 8000 bp with 234 variable sites  196 of which were parsimony-informative. All DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accessions numbers are in Table ). None of the loci analyzed proved to be under selection pressure according to the Nei–Gojobori method. All the gene trees produced by *BEAST analysis were concordant and their topology and shape were similar to those of the reference species tree  as reflected by a low K score below 0.05 in the 22 comparisons (Table ). Thus  none of the genes was excluded from the *BEAST input file and all gene trees were used to calculate the species tree. The topologies of the phylogenetic trees based on individuals using either the ML or BI method were very similar (Figure ) with two main branches: one branch corresponded to  and the other to a cluster of three groups of trouts that included northern and southern populations of marble trout and its dentex ecotype  softmouth trout  and a complex of brown trout lineages. Since these three groups split from the same internal node (polytomy)  their evolutionary relationship could not be resolved.    Posterior probabilities are written above  and ML bootstrap values below  each branch. Branches and values less than 0.50/50% are not plotted. Sm  ; Sd  ; So  ; St  . The complex of brown trout lineages included two sister groups: one originating from the Atlantic basin and the other from the Danubian and Mediterranean basins. The split between these two groups was only moderately supported (MrBayes posterior probability (MrB PP)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.53; ML bootstrap value (ML BS)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.61). The Atlantic basin group was further split into two clades that corresponded to the AT and DU mtDNA phylogeographic lineages  while the Danubian and Mediterranean group formed two clades that corresponded to the DA and AD-ME mtDNA phylogeographic lineages. In the latter clade  AD and ME lineages could not be clearly distinguished i.e. individuals from the Zrmanja River (Adriatic basin) bearing AD haplotypes showed a sister relationship to individuals from Sardinia (Mediterranean lineage) bearing ME haplotypes. The relationships among OTU shown on the phylogenetic tree based on species and lineages using the Bayesian *BEAST method (Figure ) were similar to those on the tree in Figure  but with a few specificities i.e. (1) instead of polytomy for marble trout  softmouth trout and brown trout  a split between softmouth trout and a group consisting of two sister clades (marble trout and brown trout) was observed  although with a low posterior probability in BEAST (BE PP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.82) and a high statistical support in ML (98%) and (2) within the brown trout complex  a split between individuals from the Atlantic and the Danubian and Mediterranean basins was supported with a high probability (BE PP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.93) like the split between individuals from the Adriatic basin and from Sardinia (BE PP<U+2009>=<U+2009>1).    Posterior probabilities for each split are indicated below  and time of separation from most common ancestor (in million years  MYA) and confidence intervals above  each branch. The priors used for calculation of time of split from most common ancestor are marked with an arrow. Based on the output of *BEAST and with the two priors of 4 ±1 MYA for a split between  and   and 0.7 ±0.2 MYA  when the DA and AD–ME clades last shared a common ancestor  as well as a relaxed clock  the time of the most recent common ancestor was estimated for each sister pair in Figure . Accordingly  the divergence date between Atlantic salmon and the trout complex was estimated in the late Miocene  between softmouth trout and the other trouts (brown and marble) in the late Pliocene  and between marble trout and the brown trout complex in the mid-Pleistocene about 1.5 MYA. For details on the divergence among brown trout and other intra-species  see Figure . Previously  phylogenetic analyses of the genus  were based primarily on variations within CR mtDNA and in general  the resolution of the relationships among OTU was difficult. Furthermore  many examples confirm that a phylogeny based on mtDNA does not necessarily reflect the accepted phylogeny of the species. This is expected when dealing with species that have evolved recently as is the case of . For example  mtDNA analyses of  (Jadro softmouth trout) and  (Zeta softmouth trout) have revealed haplotypes that are typical of the brown trout AD lineage rather than those that are normally present in softmouth trout. It is only after microsatellite analysis that mtDNA capture (reticulate evolution) was shown to be involved in both populations ([]; unpublished data). Whereas mtDNA describes only the maternal history of populations  nuclear markers always reflect maternal and paternal gene flow and allele histories  and are therefore more appropriate to reconstruct species tree. By using a new system based on 22 nuclear loci  we have improved the phylogeny of  and checked its match with the CR mtDNA-based phylogeny. Overall  our results show a fairly good match with the phylogeny of  inferred from CR mtDNA  since several identical genetically homogeneous groups are found with both approaches. We confirm the existence of at least five distinct genetic units: Atlantic salmon  Ohrid belvica  softmouth trout  marble trout and the brown trout complex  all of which can be distinguished from each other. However  our results do not support the sister relationship between Ohrid belvica and softmouth trout as previously hypothesized based on external morphology [] and mtDNA genetics []. Instead  our results point to a greater affinity of softmouth trout with the brown trout complex and marble trout. However  since these three species originate from one node  their relationships remain unresolved (Figures  and ). We found that softmouth trout from the rivers Jadro and Zeta  despite having Adriatic haplotypes  cluster together with other softmouth trout in the same clade  which confirms the previously reported suggestion of reticulate evolution for this species []. The fact that softmouth trout is a spring spawner suggests that it evolved prior to the Pleistocene as a consequence of an evolutionary conservatism related to water temperature during spawning (contrary to glacial species such as brown and marble trout  which require colder water and thus spawn in winter; for details  see Karaman []). A pre-glacial origin for softmouth trout is also confirmed by the divergence time estimated from *BEAST analysis (Figure ). However  it is important to emphasize the somewhat unreliable statistical support for this divergence time  although molecular markers specific to softmouth trout have never been found outside of the species’ present range and are exclusive to the narrow strip of the Western Balkans. Thus  both ecological and genetic observations imply that the origin of softmouth trout lies in this area  and that its distribution has remained limited to the Western Balkans since the time of its origin (ca. late Pliocene) until today. According to the mtDNA-based phylogeny   is a separate lineage within the  complex (  MA [])  and closely related to the AD lineage. Both lineages are considered to have originated in the Italo-Adriatic and Balkans at a time when the ME lineage evolved in the western Mediterranean (reviewed in Bernatchez [] and Cortey et al. []). However  we reposition  on the basis of the nDNA results reported here that classify it as a distinct cluster of the same or similar rank as that of  and . This observation supports the classification of marble trout as a distinct species; indeed  this is the most notable specificity that differentiates the nDNA-based tree topology (“species tree”) presented here from the previously constructed mtDNA-based trees. Our study reveals the genetic divergence between the northern and southern populations of marble trout  which could not be previously seen because of the polyphyletic origin of mtDNA haplotypes of these populations. It also provides new insight into the genetic structure of  with a considerably higher level of genetic polymorphism than previously reported on the basis of mtDNA studies []. For example  the genetic structure of seven populations of marble trout in Slovenia that are geographically separated and represent a resource for repopulation of the species [] has been well studied both with mtDNA ([  ]; unpublished data) and microsatellite markers []. Whereas the mtDNA analysis was poorly informative due to the fixation of a single haplotype (MA1a) that suggested the absence of population substructuring  microsatellite analysis revealed a very strong inter-population genetic differentiation (pairwise fixation index (F) from 0.3-0.9) probably because of a combination of a high level of microsatellite mutation and random drift (all the populations are very small). Analysis of the nDNA of the seven Slovenian populations grouped them into four genetically homogeneous units  their geographic distribution coinciding logically with the spatial proximity of the corresponding populations; according to our results  the populations diverged in the late Pleistocene. Thus  there is evidence that the marker system reported here is sufficiently polymorphic and informative to establish times of divergence for trout lineages within . The least well supported branching on the tree concerns the  complex (Figures  and ) for which the progress of how brown trout lineages developed is unclear. The lowest statistical significance was found for the relationship between OTU within the Mediterranean–Adriatic clade  but this poor resolution might be due to the small number of Mediterranean individuals sampled. However  the development of these lineages runs across a relatively narrow timeframe  as suggested both by the *BEAST-TMRCA analysis and by Bernatchez []  which could be the most likely reason for such a low phylogenetic resolution in the rest of the  complex in this study too. Our results suggest that the Atlantic group was the first brown trout lineage to split off. Ancestral divergence in the AT lineage has been demonstrated at the mtDNA level []  and also by the existence of a nucleotide polymorphism in the  nuclear gene [] but this was not confirmed in later studies (e.g.  mtDNA analyses [–]  and  nuclear gene analyses [–])  which considered the DA lineage as the oldest. We found that the DA lineage was sister to the ME–AD lineages  which  according to TMRCA  split around 0.66 MYA as previously estimated from variation in mtDNA []. The early mid-Pleistocene (0.7 MYA) saw the most drastic paleohydrological changes in the last three MY that led to the separation of previously connected river basins []. Taking into account both the nDNA and mtDNA data  the separation of the Danubian basin from the Adriatic basin seems to be one of the most marked hydrological changes that occurred at that time. Comparison of nDNA and mtDNA data detected at least four cases of mitochondrial–nuclear discordance for  (in  and ; Figure )  three of which had been previously reported based on microsatellite  or single gene analyses  or both  and mtDNA ([]; []; []). We also observed a new case of mitochondrial–nuclear discordance within softmouth trout with the population from the Vrljika River bearing a Neretva softmouth trout-specific mtDNA haplotype [] although it clustered with the Jadro and Zeta populations in the same clade on the basis of nDNA data (Figures  and ). Interestingly  all reported cases of mitochondrial–nuclear discordance in  are limited to the Adriatic river systems in the Western Balkans. Such discordances have been reported for other salmonids ([] and [–]) but to our knowledge  have not been detected in  outside the above-mentioned area. The extensive morphological and genetic variability in   together with the large proportion of mitochondrial–nuclear discordance detected in the Adriatic basin of the Western Balkans  point to an interesting and variegated evolutionary history of  taxa in the area.    Samples characterized by AD mt-phylogenetic lineage are marked in blue. Sm  ; Sd  ; St    trouts have undergone an evolutionary radiation in relatively recent times (from mid to late Pleistocene). For this reason  it has been difficult to genetically distinguish the most recently evolved populations  particularly in the Balkans  where trout have evolved into a variety of different forms. Despite this difficulty  the data reported here suggest a clear separation of the species and populations analyzed into several main evolutionary lineages  and further geographical subdivisions of these lineages. Thus  the phylogenetic trees presented here lend support to nomenclature  not only with regard to the species status of    and   but also as a means for naming the main lineages by names that already exist. Thus   would apply to the AT lineage and  to the DA lineage  as already proposed []. The situation is not so clear for the AD–ME lineage  which comprises the most complicated conglomerate of taxa e.g.     and . However  several meaningful phylogenetic subdivisions have been found in trout from the rivers Krka and Zrmanja that correspond completely with the distribution of the questionable species  Taler  1950 and  Karaman  1938. Similarly  the clear separation of Ohrid brown trout from the other trouts that inhabit nearby areas (River Neretva  the Skadar–Ohrid river system and River Bistrica in southern Albania) implies an independent taxonomic status for the Ohrid brown trout and provides support to maintaining its taxonomic epithet  as previously proposed []. Geographically clearly defined sub-lineages are evident also in marble trout. Since these share a similar phylogenetic hierarchical level to that of the main evolutionary lineages of   they should be regarded as two distinct species. However  no morphological analysis has been undertaken to compare these lineages and they do not show any visible phenotypic differences. The notable exception is   which appears to be a life-history form of Neretva marble trout []. Therefore  further research is necessary to determine whether marbled trout can be split into two geographically separated sister species. For such a classification  a detailed morphological analysis is required and to date  we propose that each lineage is considered as an evolutionary significant unit.

At present  the use of basic inheritance rules and segregation analysis appears to be the best imputation method for ungenotyped individuals. Comparison of our empirical animal-specific imputation accuracies to predictions based on selection index theory suggested that not correcting for mean gene content considerably overestimates the true accuracy. Imputation of ungenotyped individuals can help to include valuable phenotypes for genome-wide association studies or for genomic prediction  especially when the ungenotyped individuals have genotyped offspring. With the reduction in genotyping costs  data on phenotypes are becoming a limiting factor in livestock genetics  especially for traits that are difficult  expensive or invasive to measure (e.g.  feed intake). Historical datasets  for instance those used for estimating heritability  often lack genotyping data and the individuals might no longer be available for DNA collection. Imputing genotypes for these phenotyped individuals increases the potential usefulness of these phenotypes  for instance for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [–] or for genomic prediction [–]. If a relevant genotyping strategy can be chosen such that imputation accuracy is sufficiently high  imputation of ungenotyped animals might also be of interest for breeding programs to reduce genotyping costs. The difficulty for imputation lies in the fact that these phenotyped individuals have no genotypes  thus information for imputation has to come from relatives. Often the sires and grandsires of these ungenotyped individuals are genotyped  but also offspring and other relatives might be genotyped or available for genotyping  which enables imputation of ungenotyped individuals. Several software programs for imputation are available; some programs were designed for human populations and others for livestock populations. Comparisons of imputation programs have been mostly carried out for situations in which low-density genotyped individuals are imputed to high-density genotypes e.g. [–]. The performance of different imputation programs depends mostly on the data structure  e.g.  density of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels  size of the reference population  and whether related or unrelated individuals were genotyped. Thus  choosing the best imputation method for a given data set is not straightforward. Population-based imputation programs rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) information and in general perform well to impute both individuals that are unrelated to genotyped individuals and related individuals  e.g. [  –]. Pedigree-based imputation methods incorporate information from both LD and pedigree relationships for imputation. For imputation of very low-density genotyped animals  e.g.  using 384 SNPs  pedigree-based imputation programs appear to be more accurate  especially when more and closer relatives are genotyped [    ]. Only a few pedigree-based imputation programs can impute non-genotyped individuals in the pedigree  e.g.  AlphaImpute []  FImpute []  FindHap []  and PedImpute []. The accuracy of imputing ungenotyped individuals has not been extensively studied but depends strongly on the number of close relatives that are genotyped [      ]. The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of imputation of non-genotyped individuals using genotype information from relatives. This paper is based on a real (historical) dataset that includes dairy cows that were phenotyped for feed intake and with part of the dataset genotyped. To evaluate imputation accuracy  genotypes were simulated for all individuals in the pedigree. Different scenarios were evaluated (the actual data scenario  addition of genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires  and addition of offspring genotypes) to assess whether using additional genotype information increases imputation accuracy. This study was based on a real dataset of dairy cows that were phenotyped for feed intake on three experimental herds in the Netherlands. The dataset consisted of 2365 phenotyped cows with a pedigree of 14 733 individuals. In total  4097 individuals in the pedigree were genotyped with a 50 k SNP panel  of which 1021 had both phenotypes and genotypes and 3076 had only genotypes. There were 1344 phenotyped cows without genotypes that needed to be imputed  of which 998 had no recent ancestors among the genotyped individuals and 346 had a sire  a dam  grand sires or a combination of these that were genotyped. In addition  539 of the 1344 non-genotyped cows had at least one genotyped offspring. A more detailed description of the relationships between the genotyped reference population and the 1344 phenotyped cows without genotypes is in Table . To assess the accuracy of imputation based on different genotyped relatives in the real dataset  six scenarios were tested. Our first goal was to determine the accuracy of imputation in the real situation (scenario Real)  when the 1344 ungenotyped individuals with phenotypes were imputed using simulated genotypes of all 4097 individuals that were genotyped in the real data. The second goal was to assess whether imputation accuracy increased when genotypes for sires and maternal grandsires of the phenotyped individuals were available (scenario SireMGS). For this purpose  simulated genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires of the ungenotyped individuals were added to the reference population for imputation. This scenario is realistic because in practice  most sires and maternal grandsires are in fact genotyped. The third goal was to assess the increase in accuracy when the ungenotyped individuals had no  one  two or four genotyped offspring in addition to genotyped sires and maternal grandsires. For this scenario  the 805 phenotyped cows without genotypes that had no offspring in the real pedigree were selected as the testing set (no offspring scenario: Off0). For each of these 805 cows  four half-sib offspring were simulated by mating them at random with 60 simulated founder sires. In scenarios four  five and six  simulated genotypes of one (scenario Off1)  two (Off2)  and four offspring (Off4)  respectively  were available for imputation. The genotypes of the sires of the offspring (i.e.  the mates of the individuals to impute) were not included in the reference population. Table  gives an overview of all six scenarios. The 1344 individuals phenotyped but not genotyped in the real situation were used as the testing set for the scenarios Real and SireMGS. For scenarios Off0 to Off4  a subset of 805 of these 1344 individuals which did not have offspring in the real pedigree was selected for testing. Genotypes were simulated for all individuals in the pedigree following Daetwyler et al. []  in ten replicates. Sequence data was simulated for 4000 haplotypes for one chromosome using a coalescent approach []. The chromosome was 100 cM long and contained 1.0<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 base pairs that were simulated using a per site mutation rate of 2.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 and a varying effective population size over time that reflected estimates for a Holstein cattle population []: 100 in the final generation of haplotype sequence simulation  1256 at 1000 years ago  4350 at 10 000 years ago  and 43 500 at 100 000 years ago. Simulated base generation haplotypes were then dropped through the pedigree using AlphaDrop []. The pedigree comprised the real pedigree structure  with the addition of the four simulated half-sib offspring from 805 phenotyped cows that did not have genotypes nor offspring in the original dataset  and 60 simulated (founder) sires of those offspring. Thus  the final pedigree included 18 053 individuals. Two thousand bi-allelic SNPs were randomly sampled from the sequence data to represent SNPs from a SNP-chip panel and were used for imputation. The mean minor allele frequency (MAF) across all replicates was equal to 0.23. The MAF of the simulated SNPs for the full pedigree showed a slightly U-shaped distribution  which is expected for a random sample of sequence data  but the distribution was quite similar to the uniform distribution that is commonly observed in real 50 k SNP-chip cattle data e.g. []. The LD decay pattern of the simulated SNPs resembled the LD decay in dairy cattle populations. AlphaImpute  a pedigree-based imputation approach that combines long-range phasing  haplotype library imputation  simple rules and genotype probabilities  was used to impute missing genotypes []. AlphaImpute has multiple settings and the defaults described in the manual were used for most parameters  but longer cores were used to reduce the computation time for phasing. The conservative haplotype library imputation step was used to limit the number of haplotypes that get filled in for ungenotyped individuals without using pedigree information. This reduced imputation errors resulting from random matches of incorrect haplotypes with partially imputed genotypes of ungenotyped individuals. Hereafter  we refer to this imputation approach as AlphaImpute phased. As in Pimentel et al. []  we found that imputation with simple segregation rules performed better than imputation methods that used LD information. Therefore  AlphaImpute was also used in a setting without phasing  in which case  the program imputed genotypes using basic inheritance rules and segregation analysis  as described by Kerr and Kinghorn []. Only family information and allele frequencies were used when running AlphaImpute without phasing  thus no LD  linkage  or haplotype information was used. Hereafter we refer to this imputation approach as segregation analysis. Individuals in the testing set were divided into categories according to their relationship with their most recent genotyped ancestor(s) i.e.: both parents genotyped (BothParents)  sire and maternal grandsire genotyped (SireMGS)  dam and paternal grandsire genotyped (DamPGS)  sire only genotyped (Sire)  dam only genotyped (Dam)  and other (Other). For each scenario and each category  the mean animal-specific imputation accuracy and its standard deviation  the percentage of correctly and incorrectly imputed SNP genotypes per individual and the percentage of genotypes not imputed per individual were calculated across the 10 replicates. The percentage of SNP genotypes not imputed represented genotypes that were set to missing by AlphaImpute because they could not be imputed with sufficient certainty due to insufficient information  e.g. around recombination events or due to uncertainty on which haplotype was inherited from one or both parents. However  these missing SNP genotypes did receive genotype dosage probabilities and these were included when calculating the imputation accuracy. In fact  for all SNPs the genotype dosage probabilities (ranging from 0 to 2) were used  rather than the most likely genotypes. The animal-specific imputation accuracy was assessed by computing for each individual the correlation of the true genotypes (0  1  or 2) minus the mean gene content per SNP with the imputed genotype dosages minus the mean gene content per SNP as proposed by Mulder et al. []. The correction for mean gene content of each SNP was introduced because different SNPs have different MAF and thus distributions with different means  while the Pearson correlation coefficient assumes that the two variables that are correlated are bivariate normally distributed. Mean gene content was calculated per SNP as the mean of the genotypes represented as 0  1  and 2 (i.e.  2p  with p representing the frequency of the allele for which the homozygote is coded as 2)  and was based on genotyped reference individuals in each scenario. For comparisons with previous studies  we also computed the commonly used uncorrected accuracy of imputation per individual (r) based on the correlation of true genotypes with imputed genotype dosages. However  it should be noted that this accuracy is biased upward due to differences in MAF between SNPs  especially when imputation accuracy is low  and is therefore less suitable to quantify animal-specific imputation accuracy []. Besides computing imputation accuracy and percentages of (in)correct SNP genotypes and genotypes not imputed for each individual  we also computed those parameters for each SNP across individuals. SNP-specific imputation accuracy was defined as the correlation of true genotypes with imputed genotype dosages per SNP across individuals. Also for the SNP-specific imputation accuracy  genotype dosage probabilities were used  rather than the most likely genotypes. Based on pedigree information  animal-specific imputation accuracy can be predicted for ungenotyped individuals. Predicted animal-specific imputation accuracies were derived using selection index theory []  assuming genotype dosage is a trait with a heritability of 1 (assuming no genotyping errors)  which provides the accuracy of a linear prediction of gene content. The accuracy (r) is derived as: where  is a square matrix with covariances (i.e.  additive relationships) between the information sources  which are the genotyped relatives of the individual that is imputed;  is a vector with the covariances (i.e.  additive relationships) between the information sources and the individual that is imputed. Initial results showed that the animal-specific imputation accuracy was lower for AlphaImpute phased than for segregation analysis. Therefore  we report the results of segregation analysis for all scenarios. Differences between AlphaImpute phased and segregation analysis were assessed for the offspring scenarios only and are reported below. Table  shows that imputation of ungenotyped individuals based on family relationships was possible. Depending on the available family information  animal-specific imputation accuracies ranged from 0.42 to 0.72  and was 0.47 across all animals for scenario Real. Using the more commonly quoted statistic r  for which mean gene content is ignored  the imputation accuracy across all animals was 0.80. The average imputation accuracy for individuals that had only their dam genotyped as most recent ancestor was 0.70  which was higher than expected because some had an offspring genotyped (9) and most had paternal half sibs genotyped. Including genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires in the reference population improved the animal-specific imputation accuracy across all animals from 0.47 (±0.22) to 0.60 (±0.13; r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.84) (Table ). This substantial increase was obtained because  in the Real situation  few individuals had their sire and maternal grandsire genotyped  hence the large number of individuals that moved from category ‘Other’ to category ‘SireMGS’ when genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires were used (Table ). In scenario SireMGS  the animal-specific imputation accuracy for the categories ‘Sire’ and ‘Other’ decreased compared to scenario Real. This is due to the considerable drop in the number of animals in these categories; the animals that remained in these categories had fewer relationships in the pedigree  which made it more difficult to impute them. Table  shows that the addition of genotyped offspring to the reference population increased the animal-specific imputation accuracy considerably. If only one offspring was genotyped  the average animal-specific imputation accuracy across all animals increased from 0.57 (±0.12) to 0.73 (±0.07)  if a second genotyped offspring was added  it increased further to 0.82 (±0.07)  and if four genotyped offspring were added  it reached 0.92 (±0.05). Within each category of the most recent genotyped ancestor  the animal-specific imputation accuracy increased as the number of offspring genotyped increased. In particular  for the category ‘Other’  this increase was substantial: from 0.13 to 0.61  0.77 and 0.91 if zero  one  two or four genotyped offspring were added  respectively. As the number of genotyped offspring increased  the animal-specific imputation accuracies of the different categories of the most recent genotyped ancestor became more similar  which indicates that with multiple genotyped offspring  information on the ancestors was less relevant. Table  shows that the percentage of correctly imputed SNPs across all animals increased when the genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires were included  while the percentage of incorrectly imputed SNPs and of SNPs not imputed across all animals decreased. More SNPs were imputed when offspring were genotyped  which increased the percentage of correctly imputed SNPs  but if only one offspring was genotyped  the percentage of incorrectly imputed SNPs also increased. Having two or more genotyped offspring reduced the percentage of incorrectly imputed SNPs again. It should be noted that a relatively large number of genotypes were considered as not imputed because the amount of information in the data was not sufficient to impute one or both gametes (e.g.  because of uncertainty around recombination events or uncertainty on which haplotype was inherited from one or both parents). However  these genotypes obtained genotype probabilities that were included to calculate the animal-specific imputation accuracy. The relatively high animal-specific imputation accuracies indicated that the genotype probabilities were reasonably good  although the SNPs were not imputed due to uncertainty. Individuals with both parents genotyped and no offspring had an animal-specific imputation accuracy of 0.66 with AlphaImpute phased and of 0.70 with segregation analysis (Table )  which is close to the expected accuracy of a parent average prediction . Table  shows that when both parents were genotyped but no offspring  AlphaImpute phased performed considerably poorer than segregation analysis  but when both parents and offspring were genotyped  both methods performed almost equally well. Segregation analysis performed better than AlphaImpute phased when only the sire or the sire and maternal grandsire were genotyped  regardless of the number of genotyped offspring (Table ). When no ancestors were genotyped  both methods performed equally well based on animal-specific imputation accuracies. With genotyped offspring  AlphaImpute phased imputed more SNPs correctly per individual than segregation analysis: across all animals  the percentage of correctly imputed SNPs was 13%  20%  and 27% higher with AlphaImpute phased than with segregation analysis for scenarios Off1  Off2  and Off4  respectively (Table ). However  AlphaImpute phased also imputed more SNPs per individual incorrectly: across all animals  the percentage of incorrectly imputed SNPs was 4.9%  4.2%  and 2.3% higher with AlphaImpute phased than with segregation analysis for scenarios Off1  Off2  and Off4  respectively (Table ). Predicted animal-specific imputation accuracies were derived using selection index theory for situations for which both parents were genotyped  one parent and one grandparent were genotyped  and when one parent was genotyped  and each of these situations was combined with no  one  two or four genotyped offspring  as shown in Table . When offspring were genotyped and included in the reference population for imputation  observed animal-specific imputation accuracies (Table ) were higher than accuracies predicted based on selection index theory (Table )  while in the Off0 scenario  the animal-specific imputation accuracies were similar to their theoretical predictions. SNP-specific imputation accuracies increased as the number of close relatives genotyped increased  as expected (Figure ). More interesting was the fact that SNP-specific imputation accuracy depended less on MAF when offspring were genotyped. As shown in Figure   the imputation accuracy of SNPs with low MAF increased considerably when offspring were genotyped. Figure  is different to figures reported in studies that impute genotypes from low-density to higher-density SNP panels  in which LD information from typed SNPs can be used for imputation. In such cases  quite a few imputed SNPs are in complete LD with typed SNPs  and thus have a SNP-specific imputation accuracy of 1 regardless of the MAF. In this study  there were no typed SNPs and LD information was not used  thus only a few SNPs had an imputation accuracy equal to 1.  Imputation accuracy was defined as the correlation of true genotypes with imputed genotype dosages by SNP and was calculated across 10 replicates (2000 SNPs × 10 replicates) for scenario Real   SireMGS   Off0   Off1   Off2   and Off4 . The blue curves were obtained by fitting a nonparametric local regression (LOESS). As in other studies  the percentage of correctly imputed SNPs and of SNPs not imputed depended strongly on the MAF (Figure ). Results showed that a higher MAF made it difficult to impute SNPs with high certainty and therefore many of those genotypes were not imputed. If there were no genotyped offspring  the percentage of SNPs not imputed plateaued at 95-100% for SNPs with a MAF greater than 0.2 (Figure A  B  and C). With four genotyped offspring  this percentage plateaued at 60-80% for SNPs with a MAF greater than 0.3 (Figure F). Because more genotypes were imputed when offspring were genotyped  there was also more chance that they were imputed incorrectly and  therefore  the percentage of incorrectly imputed SNPs was higher with genotyped offspring (Figure C versus Figure D). However  this percentage decreased again when more offspring were genotyped (Figure C versus Figure F).  Percentages of correctly imputed genotypes (in black)  incorrectly imputed genotypes (in dark grey)  and not imputed (in light grey) genotypes by SNP  plotted against MAF for scenario Real   SireMGS   Off0   Off1   Off2   and Off4  and calculated across 10 replicates (2000 SNPs × 10 replicates). The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of imputation of non-genotyped individuals. The results showed that sufficient accuracies can be obtained when multiple offspring are genotyped. This enables re-use of valuable phenotypes from historical datasets for  e.g. GWAS or genomic prediction. Usually  such datasets with valuable phenotypes are small and in such cases  adding phenotyped individuals with imputed genotypes can have a relatively larger impact on the power of GWAS or on the improvement of the accuracies of genomic prediction. AlphaImpute was designed as a flexible method to impute genotyped and ungenotyped individuals  performs well for very low-density scenarios []  and provides informative output  such as genotype dosage based on genotype probabilities. VanRaden et al. [] showed that imputation with FindHap and FImpute performed well for imputation of ungenotyped dams with four or more genotyped offspring. However  in our study  with four or less genotyped offspring  FindHap resulted in lower imputation accuracy than AlphaImpute (ranging from 0.13 to 0.38 based on one replicate of each scenario; results not shown). Also Pimentel et al. [] reported that FindHap resulted in lower imputation accuracies than AlphaImpute for imputation of ungenotyped individuals with one genotyped offspring. FImpute did not accept ungenotyped individuals with less than four genotyped offspring  and both FindHap and FImpute do not provide genotype probabilities as output. The genotype probabilities provide an implicit measure of uncertainty in the imputation that can be taken into account in further analyses based on imputed genotypes  such as GWAS or genomic prediction. It has been shown that using genotype dosage instead of the most likely genotype for selection candidates increased the reliability of genomic predictions [  ]. For GWAS  it has also been suggested to include the uncertainty of imputed genotypes to improve power [–]. Therefore  output in the form of probabilities should become a standard output of imputation programs in the future  to enable the inclusion of imputation uncertainty into further analyses. In the segregation analysis approach  AlphaImpute was used without phasing  which resulted in imputation using only simple imputation rules and segregation analysis  and thus did not use long range phasing and haplotype library imputation []. The phasing results from AlphaImpute with phasing showed only minor errors compared to the true phase of the genotypes (results not shown) and  thus  hardly affected the imputation results. AlphaImpute with phasing  which used the haplotype library  resulted in more correctly imputed genotypes per individual but also in more incorrectly imputed genotypes per individual  which led to a lower animal-specific imputation accuracy than segregation analysis (Table ). The increase in incorrectly imputed SNPs per individual is due to the long-range haplotype imputation algorithm in AlphaImpute  which allows a certain mismatch (set to 1% in this study) between SNPs of the most likely haplotype from the haplotype library and (in a previous step imputed) genotypes of the imputed individual. It is likely that this has a smaller effect in populations with larger effective population sizes  because in such populations  larger haplotypes have a lower probability of incorrectly fitting by chance. Pimentel et al. [] showed that in scenarios with high LD  such as in dairy cattle  imputation with simple segregation rules performed better than other imputation programs they tested (FindHap  AlphaImpute  and a two-step approach using simple imputation rules followed by fastPHASE). They also showed that imputation using LD information was as successful as segregation analysis when one chromosome had at least 300 unambiguously imputed SNPs of the 2000 SNPs it contained. This indicates that the main issue with imputation of ungenotyped individuals is the limited number of SNPs that can be imputed unambiguously and these might not be evenly distributed across the genome. Therefore  imputation algorithms that are specifically designed for imputation of ungenotyped individuals are needed. If such algorithms make optimal use of all the features of genotype data  such as phase and LD information  without introducing errors  they should lead to higher imputation accuracies than segregation analysis. In the literature  several definitions of imputation accuracy are used. As pointed out by Hickey et al. [] and empirically shown by [  ]  the widely used percentage of correctly imputed SNPs depends on the MAF  and the correlation between the true genotype and the imputed genotype (or dosage) is a better measure of the quality of imputation. However  for the animal-specific imputation accuracy  different SNPs have different MAF  and thus also a distribution with a different mean  while a Pearson correlation assumes that the correlated variables are bivariate normally distributed. Therefore  we corrected genotypes for the mean gene content of each SNP  as suggested by Mulder et al. []. The uncorrected correlation (r) was overestimated as a result of bias due to differences in MAF across loci. The difference between the two statistics was particularly large when the imputation accuracy was low. When the imputation accuracy approached 1  the difference between the two statistics reduced towards 0. For individuals with both parents genotyped  imputing their genotypes as the average of its parents resulted in animal-specific imputation accuracies close to the expected accuracy for a parent average  when we corrected for mean gene content (0.70). Without this correction  the imputation accuracy was much higher (0.87) due to the aforementioned bias. This indicates that correction for mean gene content makes it possible to compare observed imputation accuracies with those calculated based on selection index theory. Therefore  we conclude that the animal-specific imputation accuracy should indeed be computed after correction of genotypes for mean gene content  as suggested by Mulder et al. []. An important question is whether the use of phenotypes from imputed animals is advantageous  for example  in GWAS or genomic prediction. This question is not specifically addressed in the simulations presented here  but has received some attention in the literature. For example in human GWAS studies  inclusion of predicted genotypes for phenotyped individuals can increase the power of GWAS when close relatives are genotyped [–]. Chen et al. [] did not observe a clear relationship between imputation accuracy and improvement in power  but there appeared to be a trade-off between imputation accuracy and sample size. Even when imputation was relatively inaccurate  adding phenotyped individuals with predicted genotypes increased power compared to not using these individuals in the study []  which suggested that imputation of ungenotyped individuals with phenotypes is worthwhile for GWAS. For genomic prediction  a few studies have shown that the accuracy of genomic predictions can be improved when phenotyped individuals with imputed genotypes are added to the reference population of genotyped individuals [  ]. Pimentel et al. [] showed that improvement in the accuracy of genomic prediction was in general larger when heritability of the trait was lower  and when the initial reference population was smaller. Pszczola et al. [] showed no significant improvement in accuracy of genomic prediction from adding imputed genotypes due to low imputation accuracy  although a slight improvement was seen with low heritabilities. The authors suggested that the low imputation accuracy was caused by the population structure  as only sires and maternal grandsires had genotypes. Likewise  Hickey et al. [] indicated that imputation of ungenotyped individuals that are distantly related to the genotyped population do not contribute much to the improvement in accuracy of genomic prediction. Thus  for genomic prediction  the addition of animals with phenotypes and imputed genotypes to the datasets increases accuracy also  although the magnitude of this improvement depends on heritability of the trait  imputation accuracy  and size and structure of the population [–]. Another important question is whether an imputation step is actually necessary to improve the accuracy of genomic predictions. The so-called one-step approach conveniently combines genotyped and ungenotyped animals through a relationship matrix  called the H-matrix [  ]. Using this one-step approach  Christensen and Lund [] and Hickey et al. [] showed that including many additional phenotyped animals without genotypes into the reference population improved the accuracy of genomic predictions compared to using only the genotyped individuals as the reference population. However  it should be kept in mind that the one-step approach applies an implicit linear imputation method  similar to imputation using mixed model equations suggested by Gengler []. In other words  the implicit imputation in the one-step approach may be less accurate than imputation using more sophisticated methods and may lead to a loss in accuracy in genomic prediction. Hickey et al. [] compared two strategies to include phenotypes of ungenotyped individuals in the reference population  i.e.  prediction using an explicit imputation step and prediction using an H-matrix. They found very small differences in accuracy of genomic predictions between the two methods. Unfortunately  neither the imputation accuracy of the ungenotyped individuals  nor the relationships between genotyped and ungenotyped individuals were provided in Hickey et al. []  and linear imputation might have been sufficient with their data. In the current study  we have shown that imputation accuracies from segregation analysis are higher than those predicted by selection index theory when offspring are genotyped. Therefore  we also expect a higher accuracy of genomic predictions  when the genotypes of such animals are imputed explicitly using sophisticated methods. Ungenotyped individuals from a historical dairy cattle population could be imputed with an imputation accuracy  i.e. correlation of true genotype with the imputed genotype dosage corrected for mean gene content  of 0.60 when genotypes of sires and maternal grandsires were available. When the more common correlation between genotype dosage and true genotype (r) was used  an imputation accuracy of 0.84 was obtained. With genotyped offspring  imputation accuracies increased towards 0.92 (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.96) with four offspring and MAF and ancestor genotypes became less relevant for imputation. Basic segregation rules appeared to be the best currently available imputation method for ungenotyped individuals. Therefore  imputation algorithms specifically designed for ungenotyped individuals using LD and family information need to be developed in order to further increase imputation accuracies by using all features of genotype data. Comparison of our empirical animal-specific imputation accuracies with predictions based on the selection index theory suggested that not correcting for mean gene content considerably overestimates the true animal-specific imputation accuracy. In conclusion  imputation of ungenotyped individuals can help to include valuable phenotypes in GWAS or genomic predictions  in particular when genotyped offspring are available.

For fin erosion  SGE were only significant for the second and third dorsal fin. Including SGE for fin length and fin erosion in the animal model increased the estimated heritable variation. However  estimates of total heritable variances were inaccurate and a larger experiment is needed to accurately quantify total heritable variance. Despite this  our results demonstrate that considering social breeding values for fin length or fin erosion when selecting fish will enable us to improve response to selection for welfare traits in Atlantic cod juveniles. Atlantic cod () is an omnivorous fish species with cannibalistic and aggressive behaviour [  ]. Aggressive interactions between fish may in general cause fin damage  including splitting  erosions  and thickening of the fins []. Fin damage may also affect growth  survival and the general welfare of the fish [  ]  and fin damage assessments may be used as an indicator of the strength of social hierachies []. It is however largely unknown to which extent the social interactions between fish have a genetic component. Atlantic cod is a relatively new farmed species in Norway. Selective breeding programs for cod have until now mainly focused on improving growth rate  and there is currently little knowledge about the size of the heritable genetic components of welfare-related traits such as aggression. The general idea behind socially affected traits is that the observed phenotype of an individual does not only depend on the genes of the animal but also on the genes of the other animals in the group [–]. Thus  each animal may have a direct genetic effect on its own phenotype but also a social genetic effect (SGE  also known as associative effect or indirect genetic effect) on the other animals in its environment. In classical breeding  the models for breeding value estimation only account for the direct effect of the animal itself  ignoring social effects. Studies in other species such as quail []  pigs e.g. [] and poultry  e.g. [  ]  have shown that social interactions between animals may be responsible for a substantial part of the heritable variance for traits such as growth and survival. For example  Ellen et al. [] found heritabilities of 2 to 10% for survival in three layer lines when using a conventional animal model  whereas the total heritable variation ranged from 6 to 19% when both direct and SGE were considered. Thus  taking into account SGE can increase response to selection for traits affected by social effects. Genetic correlations between direct and social effects are also important  since the presence of SGE may reverse response to selection if SGE are ignored when selecting breeders to produce the next generation [    ]. Little is known about SGE in farmed aquaculture species. In mussel ()  Brichette et al. [] studied growth cultures and estimated the genetic correlation between direct and social effects of -0.2. Heritabilities including direct effects only for shell length at an age of around eight and eleven months were 0.104 and 0.232  whereas the proportions of phenotypic variance described by social effects were only 0.010 and 0.087. In Nile tilapia ()  there is one study on SGE of body weight []. However  these authors did not find any indications of SGE of body weight in a six-week experiment. The aim of this study was to estimate direct and social genetic parameters for growth traits and traits related to fish welfare (fin damage) in Atlantic cod juveniles. Data were analyzed using both a classical animal model and an animal model with direct and social genetic effects in order to compare the estimated total heritable variance of the two models. In total  2100 cod juveniles from 100 half- and full-sib families (73 sires and 100 dams) that originated from the third generation of the Norwegian Cod Breeding Program in Tromsø were used. These fish have mainly been selected for growth and to some extent for resistance to vibriosis (see Bangera et al. [] for more details about the breeding program). The complete pedigree contained 160 sires and 197 dams. The fish were hatched in March 2009 and each family was kept in separate tanks until tagging. In September  the fish (average weight approximately 24 g) were anaesthetized (metacaine  0.08 g/L) and tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT-tag ID100A  Trovan Ltd  Hessle  UK) injected into the abdominal cavity. From tagging until the start of the experiment in November  the fish from each family were held in one common 500 L tank and under similar conditions. The experimental design  including the number of fish and families per tank needed to obtain reliable estimates of genetic effects  was determined by simulations and power calculations (see []). In this study  the fish were not subjected to any potentially harmful treatment  and we did not sample biological material such as blood samples. Consequently  the local representative approved the experiment without any application according to the rules by The Norwegian Animal Research Authority at the time the experiment was conducted. At the start of the experiment (2 November 2009)  each of the 100 families with 21 fish was divided into three groups of seven fish. The three groups from each family were then randomly assigned to one of 100 tanks of 130 L  so each tank contained 21 fish from three families  giving an average density of fish of 5.6 kg/m at the start of the experiment. At the end of the experiment  the average density was about 10.3 kg/m. During the experimental period  the fish were fed a dry feed (Classic Marine Biomar) on a restricted basis (60% of normal feeding level using a feed conversion ratio of 1.5) 12 times per day  in order to promote social interactions among the fish. The feed was provided to each tank using an automatic feeder and the amount of feed for each tank was calculated based on feeding rate and biomass in each tank after two weeks. Each tank was supplied with unfiltered sea water (30–34% salinity). Water temperature was recorded daily and oxygen content was recorded twice a week in the tanks with the highest biomass and once a week in the other tanks. The mean water temperature was 8.7°C (range 8.2-9.8°C) and the light regime in the housing facilities was continous. Water flow was adjusted to 5 L/min during the whole period  securing levels of oxygen saturation of between 87 and 97% throughout the experiment. A circumferential water current of about 5.6 cm/s was created by directing the water inflow through vertical  perforated inlet pipes  as described in []. The average length of the fish increased from 15.4 cm at the start of the experiment to 18.4 cm at the end of the experiment  and consequently  the water velocities corresponded to relative speeds that decreased from approximately 0.36 body lengths per second (BL/s) at the start to 0.33 BL/s at the end of the experiment. The experiment lasted for six weeks and recordings of the fish were performed three times. Recording 1 was conducted on 2–3 November 2009  when the fish were stocked into the experimental tanks. Recording 2 was performed two weeks after the start of the experiment and recording 3 at the end of the experiment. Before each recording  the fish were anaesthetized with metacain (MS-222  0.08 g/L)  after which body weight (0.1 g) and length (0.1 cm) of the fish were measured. In addition  erosions of the first  second and third dorsal fins and of the caudal fin were scored subjectively at the end of the experiment. Fin erosion is damage to the fin that results in loss of epithelial fin tissue and all or part of the fin ray []. The degree of fin erosion was scored by a single person on a scale from 0 to 100%  in 5% intervals. At recording 1  20 fish died due to an accident during sedation. These 20 fish were replaced with fish from the same families as those of the fish that died. The number of fish that died during the whole experiment was also recorded. In order to measure the length of the fins  a digital photo was taken of each fish at each of the three recordings. Before the photo was taken  the fish was placed on a uniform white background with the left side of its body up. A calibration ruler and two pieces of paper with the tank number and the number of the fish were placed above and beside the fish. Using digital image analysis (MATLAB software version 7.12  r2011a)  lengths of the three dorsal fins and of the caudal fins were measured by estimating the maximum length of the fin (i.e. parallel to the fin rays). A ten cm scale was used as a calibration vector (see Figure ). The position of the cursor and mouse clicks were used to measure the fin lengths by locating the starting points of fins on the base side and the end points of the fins on the outer side  along with the fin ray. The measurements of the length of the four fins were done by three persons  each scoring 40  49 and 11% of the fins.                                                      Body weights at the three recordings  specific growth rate (SGR)  change in condition factor (CCF  between recordings 1 and 3)  fin length  and fin erosion were considered for statistical analysis. The condition factor is an expression of the condition of the fish based on the assumption that weight is proportional to the cube of the length of the fish  such that the condition factor is higher when fish are more spherical. CCF from recording 1 to recording 3 was calculated as: SGR  defined as percentage increase in body weight per unit time  was calculated as:  where weight1 and weight3 are the weights at recordings 1 and 3 and t – t is the number of days between recordings 1 and 3. Fin damage was quantified based on lengths of the first  second  third and the dorsal fins at each of the three recordings and based on subjective scores of erosion on the four fins at the end of the experiment. Genetic analyses of the studied traits were performed using the ASReml software []. Data were first analyzed using an animal model without social effects: where  is a vector of phenotypes for the observed trait   is a vector of the age of the fish at each recording and the fixed effect of the person (1  2  3) who scored fin length (included only when fin length was analyzed)   is a vector of random direct additive genetic effects   is a vector of common environmental tank effects in the rearing period   is a vector of experimental tank effects   is a vector of residuals  and     and  are incidence matrices. The model with social interactions included both the direct genetic effect of the focal individual and the SGE of each of its group mates  as proposed by Muir [] (see also [  ]). The model was: where  is a vector of random social additive genetic effects   is the associated incidence matrix  and the other parameters are as described above. Note that fitting effects of the experimental tank is equal to fitting a social environmental effect for each animal []. Based on the above models  the following variance components and parameters were estimated:  = direct additive genetic variance;  = social additive genetic variance;  = direct-social additive genetic covariance;  = variance of common environmental tanks effects in the rearing period (1  …  100);  = variance of experimental tank effects (1  ....  100). From these estimated parameters  the following parameters were derived:  = variance of the total breeding values;  = phenotypic variance; T<U+2009>=<U+2009>the total heritable variance relative to the phenotypic variance: . The total heritable variance was calculated as: where  is the number of fish in the tank. This is the total heritable variance  due to both direct and SGE  that determines the potential of the population to respond to selection []. Phenotypic variance was calculated as: This expression defines phenotypic variance for groups that consist of unrelated individuals. With SGE  phenotypic variance depends on relatedness between interacting individuals []  which may hamper the comparison of genetic parameters  such as heritabilities  between studies. Therefore  phenotypic variance was expressed for the “default” situation  i.e.  for a population that consists of unrelated individuals. Heritabilities were estimated using the univariate linear animal models described above. The importance of including the SGE was tested using log likelihood tests by comparing the differences in the likelihood between the traditional animal model and the model that included both direct effects and SGE. In addition  correlations between direct and social breeding values for weight at recording 3 and for fin damage traits with significant social effects were estimated using bivariate animal models that contained the same fixed and random effects as described above for the univariate models. The average weight of the fish increased from 34.5 to 63.5 g (Table ) during the experiment  resulting in a SGR of 1.45% per day. The length of all four fins also increased during the experiment. The highest level of fin erosion (23.1%) was measured on the first dorsal fin. In total  28 fish died during the experiment  of which seven died before the second recording  13 during the second recording and the remaining in the period between recordings 2 and 3. The number of fish that died during the experiment was randomly distributed over families and tanks. Using a classical animal model  estimates of heritability for weight were 0.34  0.33  and 0.24 at recordings 1  2  and 3  respectively (Table ). The proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by common environment in the rearing period (s) was relatively constant from recording 1 to recording 3 (7.5 and 7.6%). The effect of the experimental tank was small  increasing from 0 at recording 1 to 2.1% of the phenotypic variation at recording 3. Estimates of heritability for SGR and CCF were equal to 0.16 and 0.13. Estimates of heritability for fin length (Table ) at the three recordings were highest for the first dorsal fin (0.60 to 0.80) and lowest for the second dorsal fin (0.05 to 0.33). There were some differences between estimates of heritability for the three recordings for all four fins. The variance due to common environment in the rearing period was small and non-significant for nearly all recordings and fins. The variance of the experimental tank effect increased between recordings 1 to 3 and explained from 6% (caudal fin) to 36% (second dorsal fin) of the total phenotypic variation at recording 3. Estimates of heritability for subjectively scored fin erosion (Table ) were low for the second and the third dorsal fins and the caudal fin but very high for the first dorsal fin (0.83). This pattern was in reasonable agreement that observed for estimates of heritability of fin lengths (Table ). The experimental tank explained from 13 (first dorsal fin) to 39% (second dorsal fin) of the total phenotypic variation in fin erosion. For all growth traits  the log likelihood tests between the model with and without SGE were non-significant (Table ; the analyses for weight at recording 1 did not converge). This suggests that the conventional animal model is the most relevant model for growth traits and that social effects either do not exist  or their effects are too small to be detected in our experimental design. For length of the four fins  the likelihood ratio tests for including SGE were highly significant at recordings 2 and 3. As expected  SGE for length were non-significant at recording 1 for the first and second dorsal fins and for the caudal fin. Contrary to expectations  SGE were significant for length of the third dorsal fin at recording 1 (Table ). Especially at recording 3  the estimated ratio of total heritable variance over phenotypic variance (T) was high  sometimes significantly greater than 1  although the estimates were inaccurate. The variance due to common rearing environment prior to the recording period was zero or non-significant for all four fins and all three recordings. For fin erosions  the likelihood ratio tests for existence of SGE were significant for the second and the third dorsal fins (Table ) but not for the first dorsal fin and the caudal fin. The variance due to common rearing environment was small and non-significant for all fins  except for the caudal fin  whereas the experimental tank effect was significant for all fins and explained from 9.8 (first dorsal fin) to 24.1% (second dorsal fin) of the total variation in fin erosions. The ratios of total heritable variance over phenotypic variance were high for the second (1.37) and the third (0.48) dorsal fins and much higher than the heritability estimated using the traditional animal model (Table ). Estimates of correlations between direct breeding value for weight at recording 3 and the social breeding values for fin erosions and fin length were negative for all evaluated traits  except for erosion of the second dorsal fin (Table ). However  all estimates had large standard errors and were not significantly different from zero. The direct genetic effects of weight and of fin length and fin erosion at recording 3 were moderately to highly correlated (0.41-0.85)  with the exception of erosion of the first dorsal fin  which was not significantly different from zero. In this study  we estimated genetic parameters for direct and social genetic effects for growth traits and fin damage traits in Atlantic cod. To our knowledge  this is the first study that investigates the SGE of traits directly related to welfare in aquaculture species. The estimated ratio of total heritable variance over phenotypic variance (T) was significantly greater than 1 for some of the fin damage traits  although the estimates had large standard errors. This means that we documented strongly significant SGE for fin damage traits but that the experiment was not large enough to accurately quantify the total heritable variance  although the experimental design was based on the simulation study by Ødegård and Olesen []. They showed that  over an average of 50 replicates  this design would provide accurate breeding values and estimates of direct and social genetic variance components. In addition  Ødegård and Olesen [] did not fit the family effect (the effect due to common rearing of the families)  which we did in the current study and this added an additional parameter to estimate. The likelihood ratio tests for including the SGE for fin length were highly significant at recordings 2 and 3 for all four fins but estimates of the social additive genetic variances (Var(A)) were small. At first glance  the fact that small estimates for Var(A) are highly significant suggests a contradiction. However  the full social effect caused by an individual equals (n-1)A and its variance equals (n-1)^2 Var(A)  which was large for the cases in which the SGE was significant. Thus  for the significant results  the variance of total SGE is large  and there is no contradiction. The traditional animal model without SGE was the best model for fin length at initial stocking of the fish (recording 1)  whereas the model with SGE was the best model at recordings 2 and 3 (Table ). This is as expected since the social hierarchy is established in the period after stocking the fish in the tanks. Thus  at recording 1 we expect neither tank effects  nor SGE. Tank effects and SGE were included in the model at recording 1 as a check of our methods. Evidence of large SGE or tank effects at recording 1  would have indicated a problem with our model or experiment. This check of presence of social and tank effects at recording 1 increases the confidence that the observed significant effects at recordings 2 and 3 are real. This check  however  gave one unexpected result  which was the significance of SGE for length of the third dorsal fin at recording 1 (Table ). This may be the result of the common environment effect mistakenly being detected as a SGE. Our design was not well suited for the detection of the common environment rearing effects since we only had a limited number of half-sib groups. In addition  the estimate of the experimental tank effect converged to zero  indicating that standard errors of the estimates may be underestimated. Nevertheless  the estimates of the variance of SGE at recording 1 were very small and  as mentioned earlier  the likelihood ratio test showed that the conventional animal model was the best model for all four fins at recording 1. None of the estimates of the correlations between direct breeding values for growth at recording 3 and social breeding values for fin erosions and fin length (Table ) were significant. Hence  although most estimates were negative  we cannot make any conclusion on whether selection on direct breeding values for growth will result in a reduction in welfare-related traits. In contrast to fin damage traits and despite the significantly restricted feeding used in the study  no significant SGE were found for any of the studied growth traits. Rutten et al. [] ran a six-week experiment with 450 fish from eight full-sib families randomly distributed into 45 tanks. Body weight of the fish was recorded at the start of the experiment and at the end of the experiment. No SGE for body weight was found. However  a design with only eight families  eight tanks and a random distribution of fish within each family  as that used in their study  is not optimal to detect SGE [  ]. Estimates of heritability obtained for growth using the traditional animal model are in line with earlier estimates for Atlantic cod juveniles at tagging age [  ]. One unexpected result is the differences in heritabilities between the four different fins that were observed for both fin length and fin erosion; for the first dorsal fin  estimates of heritability were extremely high for both length (0.60 to 0.80) and erosion (0.83)  which may indicate the existence of a genetic deformity rather than fin damage on the first dorsal fin. To our knowledge  there are no previous estimates of heritabilities of fin length and fin erosions in aquaculture. In the study by Hatlen et al. [] on 55 g cod juveniles  the fin damage decreased from the first fin to the second fin  to the third dorsal fin  and was lowest for the caudal fin. This agrees with our study  except that we observed more fin erosions on the caudal fin compared to the third dorsal fin. Hatlen et al. [] studied growth and fin damage of both dorsal and pectoral fins in three groups of Atlantic cod (55  250  and 450 g) under feed deprivation. Incidence of fin damage differed between groups; in the 55 g group  which is closest in size to the fish of our experiment  incidences of damage on the dorsal fins were higher than for the other two groups. Pectoral fins  in contrast  were more often damaged in the 250 g fish. In our study  we only considered fin damage of the dorsal and the caudal fins but studies on bigger fish should also consider the pectoral fins  since incidence of fin damage differs between size groups of fish []. Hatlen et al. [] found that fast-growing fish also had a lower incidence of fin damage than slow-growing fish  which suggests that the fish that received most aggression may have been prevented from feeding. In this study  we used subjective scoring of fin erosions and fin length using digital image analysis to quantify fin damage. Subjective scoring of fin erosion has been done in previous studies for other species  e.g. rainbow trout () []. Fin damage can affect growth  survival and welfare of the fish [  ]. The likelihood ratio tests for including SGE for fin length were highly significant at recordings 2 and 3 for all four fins. In contrast  SGE for fin erosion were only significant for the second and third dorsal fins. Measuring fin length and scoring fin erosion are two ways of quantifying fin damage. For fin length  the maximum length of each fin is estimated  which is phenotypically positively related to body size for fish with undamaged fins []. However  fin damage may also occur at the upper part of the fins  which would not affect maximum length of the fin but would be included when quantifying fin erosion. The differences in scoring fin damage based on fin length versus fin erosions are also reflected in the phenotypic correlations between the two traits at recording 3  which were -0.83  -0.89  -0.65  -0.83 for the first  second  and third dorsal fins and for the caudal fin  respectively (He  Nielsen and Olesen  unpublished data). One advantage of image analysis to measure fin length is that the photos can be analysed after completion of the experiment  which minimizes the handling time of the fish. In addition  for breeding experiments with many fish and families  it is important to have a fast and efficient method to quantify fin damage. However  measuring fin length precisely on large numbers of fish can be challenging. Results from a study of a sub-set of the data used here [] showed that repeatability estimates for fin length scored by three different persons ranged from 0.46 for the first dorsal fin to 0.61 for the caudal fin. In spite of these relatively low to moderate repeatabilities  significant estimates of heritabilities and social genetic variance were found for fin length in the current study  which indicates that fin length can be used to quantify fin damage in Atlantic cod. However  the method used to measure fin length could be improved by having all digital analyses done by the same person or by using chromatic pictures []. In this study  we used cod juveniles of about eight months of age (35 g). Usually  farmed Atlantic cod are transferred to sea cages at approximately one year of age  where they are then reared until harvest. The breeding goal in Atlantic cod is weight at harvesting. Thus  one may argue that social interactions should also be studied at a later period. However  detecting SGE during the grow-out period would require recording weight and fin damage traits on a large scale in a design with many small cages in the sea [  ]  which is very demanding in practice. In addition  earlier studies suggested that fin damage [] and cannibalism are more pronounced in smaller fish []. At present  we do not know if our results are also valid for cod at later stages or under less restricted feeding  i.e.  whether the genetic correlations between social effects at different ages and with  feeding are high. The current data structure included relatively small groups of fish (21 per tank)  which are far from real commercial conditions. When fish are reared in sea cages  group sizes increase sustantially and it is likely that the social hierarchy is less stable in larger groups of fish. In addition  the social effect of a single individual on other individuals may depend on group size  since the social effects are distributed over more animals in larger groups  which is called dilution []  and because larger groups are typically spread over a larger water volume. Based on the results from this study  we conclude that social effects on fin length and fin erosion contribute to heritable variation for those traits under restricted feeding  which is hidden in a classical animal model. Considering estimates of social breeding values for fin length or fin erosion when selecting fish will enable us to improve response to selection in traits related to welfare such as fin length and fin erosion in Atlantic cod juveniles. However  testing for SGE on a large scale would represent a challenge in practice. Further studies are needed to quantify the SGE more precisely and to test whether our results are also valid for the grow-out period.

A higher density marker panel and functional analyses will be required to validate the role of  or other regulatory variants and their interaction with MC1R for the modification of black coat color in  influenced cattle. Coat color phenotypes are used in breed recognition for cattle and other livestock species. Marketing strategies  such as the Certified Angus Beef program in the United States of America that only accepts cattle with at least 51% black coat color (and which exhibit Angus influence)  have opened venues for price discrimination due to such qualifications. Availability of either premiums or discounts due to coat color phenotypes can have a direct impact on producers’ breeding strategies and an understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in cattle pigmentation is desirable. The melanocortin-1 receptor (alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor  MC1R) is responsible for the primary switch of pheomelanin (red to yellow pigment) to eumelanin (black to brown pigment) in the melanogenesis pathway. In cattle  differences in base color are attributed to mutations in the  gene  historically termed the extension locus  with alleles coding for black ()  red ()  and wild-type (). These alleles were presumed to follow a dominance model  in which <U+2009>><U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>. The wild-type allele () produces a functional receptor that responds to both the a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) ligand and its antagonist  agouti-signaling protein (ASP). The  allele  caused by a leucine to proline point mutation  creates a constitutively active receptor that results in eumelanin production most likely because of a-MSH ligand binding mimicry []. The recessive allele () leads to the production of only pheomelanin because of a frameshift mutation that creates a prematurely terminated  non-functional receptor [  ]. Various degrees of red pigmentation were observed in ½  (Nellore) ½  (Angus) cattle with the  genotype at   which were expected to be black. This observation plus anecdotal evidence from other cattle crosses and mouse studies [] suggest that other loci can modify the expected black coat color. The objective of this study was to identify loci that modify black coat color in F Nellore-Angus cattle heterozygous () for  We hypothesized that degree of reddening on a black background was a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes of small effect. Cattle used in this study were a subset of an experimental population  known as the Texas A&M McGregor Genomics Cycle 1 Population  located in central Texas (latitude: 31.3865  longitude: -97.4105) that consisted of 14 full-sibling F families produced by multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (ET) and founded by Nellore grandsires and Angus granddams. Blood samples were collected on all live-born animals in the population  and DNA was extracted from white blood cell pellets by proteinase K digestion. Parentage was assigned using a panel of 12 to 14 microsatellite markers. All procedures that involve animals were approved by the Texas A&M Institutional Care and Use Committee; AUP 2002–116  2005–147 and 2008–234. Calves were photographed at birth  steers were photographed in the feeding pens and females were photographed shortly after each calving. Because there was a wide spectrum of base colors observed in the population  all calves were genotyped for  (RefSeq NM_174108.2) using the E3 and E4 primers designed by Klungland et al. []  which amplifies a 739 base pair fragment of  encompassing the SNP c.296C<U+2009>><U+2009>T ( to  allele) and the deletion c.311delG ( allele). Comparison of resultant genotypes with photographs revealed that  homozygotes were black and  homozygotes ranged in color from yellow to black as expected. However   heterozygotes often exhibited various degrees of reddening and were not black as predicted by the dominance series <U+2009>><U+2009><U+2009>><U+2009>. Degree of black was classified from 1 (lightly black; mostly red) to 9 (solid black) from photographs by three evaluators and a consensus score was determined (Figure ). Photographs taken either in the feedlot or pasture at weaning age or older were available for 213 of the 238  ET F cattle (four bulls  115 steers  and 94 females).  Examples of  F Nellore-Angus cattle that scored a 1 through 9  respectively  starting at the top left and proceeding left to right down the rows. Cattle influenced by  breeds and  often darken during the fall and winter although this has not been documented experimentally. Some photographs were taken in the spring/summer whereas others were taken in the fall/winter  which may introduce bias because of lighting and seasonal effects. Because of this  dates of images  which were available for all photographs of the project  and season of photographs  were constructed as a two-level fixed effect to reduce bias. Photographs were classified as summer if taken from May to October and winter if taken from November to April due to the seasonal changes in Texas. To avoid further bias  each photograph was scored separately and independently. No comparisons were made between photos. To verify that a mutation in  of  origin did not contribute to the reddening phenotype  the MC1-RF2 and MC1-RR1 primers from Graphodatskaya et al. [] were used to characterize the entire coding sequence of  in a subset of the ET F and paternal half-siblings to the F animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>31) produced by natural service that varied in their degree of black and their  genotype. Straightbred  and  cattle and F ×  cattle (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>27) were also sequenced to further characterize the SNPs identified. General linear model procedures of SAS® (SAS® Institute Inc.  Cary  NC) were then used to evaluate fixed effects of sire  family-nested within sire  sex  year born or birth year-season combinations (four birth years  fall and spring seasons)  and season photographed. The four bulls present in the dataset were excluded from subsequent analyses since they all ranged from 7 to 9 for degree of black and because color descriptions of bulls have shown that they can be darker than steers []  which may create bias. Furthermore  one family consisted of only one individual. This individual was highly reddened  which could cause statistical bias when including family-nested within sire effects  and was therefore excluded from further analyses  leaving a total of 208  ET F cattle for this study. Neither birth year-season nor year of birth  when evaluated independently of each other  contributed to variation in degree of black (<U+2009>><U+2009>0.25)  and were excluded from the final model. No interactions of sex  sire  and family-nested within sire were detected. Residuals from the final model  which included sire  family-nested within sire  sex and season photographed were used for interval and association analyses and full models were used to run a Bayesian association analysis. Genotypes for these analyses were produced using the BovSNP50v1 assay (Illumina Inc.  San Diego  CA) and SNP coordinates from build Btau4.0 of the bovine genome sequence. Data were filtered to remove genotypes for SNPs with a minor allele frequency less than 0.05  SNPs with completion rates below 90%  and SNPs that deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.0001). Initially  a set of 7112 markers informative in every family was used for interval analyses by applying the full sibling additive and dominance models of GRID software []  with 1 cM steps assuming 1 cM<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 Mb  chromosome-wise significance thresholds established by 5000 permutations of the data  and the 95% confidence interval was established by 5000 bootstraps with resampling. Single-marker association analyses were performed using PLINK [] for 39 480 SNPs with Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. Both interval and single-marker association analyses are known to not estimate the size of QTL effects precisely [  ]  therefore Bayesian association analyses  which fit all available markers simultaneously  were also implemented using GenSel [] to verify findings and provide more precise estimates of QTL effects. Based on preliminary analyses  the proportion of markers that did not contribute to variation in degree of black (designated as p) was known to be large  and therefore only a small subset of the markers (1 – p) was needed for inclusion in the model for Bayesian analysis. The exact proportion of those markers  however  was unknown. The p parameter was estimated by first calculating the genomic heritability estimate (  a ratio of the posterior means of the genetic and phenotypic variances) when p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 using BayesC [  ] procedures (i.e.  all markers share a constant genetic variance and are included in the model) and then increasing p in intervals while keeping other parameters constant until a slight drop (0.01 to 0.02) in genomic heritability was observed  which determined . The architecture of this trait also indicated that a single variance component for all markers was inappropriate  so BayesB [] procedures (i.e.  all markers have individual variances) were applied with 51 000 iterations (1000 burn-in) using . Estimates of marker variance were grouped into megabase (Mb) regions using the “windowBV” option and association was determined using the posterior probability of association (PPA) for each window [  ]. Windows that accounted for greater than 0% of the genetic variance were ranked and those windows in the top 25 percentile (i.e.  PPA<U+2009>><U+2009>0.75) were said to be associated. Coordinates of QTL were used to identify candidate genes concordant with the QTL region based on the Btau4.0 sequence assembly and genome maps at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; ). Genes within 5 Mb surrounding the QTL position were investigated based on available information in the NCBI database and reported results of other experiments. Functional homologs in mouse were also investigated. Two additional sets of degree of black score residuals were generated. Haplotypes that spanned 1 Mb and were centered on a positional candidate gene relative to identified QTL were recovered. SNPs located within this 1 Mb region and that passed all previously described quality editing were phased with fastPHASE software []. Resolved haplotypes were tracked through the three-generation pedigree. First  breed-of-origin of each haplotype was assigned (Nellore versus Angus) and ordered based on parent of origin (sire then dam) resulting in four levels (Angus (AA)  Angus-Nellore (AN)  Nellore-Angus (NA)  and Nellore (NN)). Second  unique haplotypes were numbered and paired in order of parent of origin to form phased genotypes of each animal. In each case  these scores were included as a fixed effect in the previously described models to produce a second and third set of residuals for interval analysis. For Bayesian analysis  breed-of-origin genotypes were included as a fixed effect in the previously described models to use for association analysis. Two coding SNPs of  origin were identified at c.583C<U+2009>><U+2009>T (ss784304484) and c.663 T<U+2009>><U+2009>C (ss784304485) of . These were the only additional coding variants that we identified in this intron-less gene and they were in complete phase with the  allele (c.296C<U+2009>><U+2009>T). Detection of this single haplotype (TTC) in  straightbred and crossbred cattle (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>58) suggested that nucleotide variability in  derived from  did not contribute to variation in degree of black in  heterozygotes. Furthermore  we observed long-range haplotypes (due to linkage) that extended for more than 1 Mb either side of . All  heterozygotes were imputed from the haplotypes of their parents to be heterozygous for the CCT/TTC  haplotypes. Within families  heterozygotes that shared the same pair of long-range haplotypes varied widely in their degree of black coat color; therefore  we think it is unlikely that a regulatory variant associated with MC1R could explain the observed reddening effect. Unexpectedly  a major locus associated with degree of black was detected on BTA6 ( chromosome 6) at an average location of 71 Mb (95% CI from 60 to 73 Mb) by interval analysis (Table ). Suggestive (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) and significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) QTL were also identified on BTA4 and 5  respectively. When 10 of the 29 bovine chromosomes generated runtime errors due to long strings of heterozygous SNPs  single-marker association analysis was run and detected the major locus on BTA6 (Bonferroni corrected <U+2009>=<U+2009>3.88e)  but did not confirm the QTL on BTA4 or 5. Bayesian association analysis also confirmed the major locus on BTA6 (but not those on BTA4 or 5) with PPA<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.00 (Figure A-B). The posterior mean of genetic variance for the 72 Mb region accounted for 43.75% of the total genetic variance using Bayesian association analysis  and an expanded region from 68 Mb to 72 Mb region accounted for 44.19% of the total genetic variance. Posterior means of variances and genomic heritability are in Table .  Original model with chromosome-wide significant thresholds (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01 and 0.05) as the dashed and dotted lines  respectively  for the interval analysis  while the posterior probability of association (PPA) is plotted for the Bayesian analysis;  original model using single-marker association methods with absolute value of t-statistics and <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05 threshold as the dashed line;  model including  region breed-of-origin genotypes with chromosome-wide significant thresholds as described before. The position of the major locus on BTA6 coincided with a cluster of tyrosine kinase receptor genes including  ()    and  (). Mutations in  cause pigmentation defects and patterns in several species (as reviewed by Fontanesi et al. [])  and QTL for spotting have been found at or near  in cattle [–]. The frequency of any spotting (body or face) among  heterozygotes in this study was 0.2  so to confirm that the QTL detected was indeed degree of black and not a false positive association with spotting  two additional analyses were performed. First  spotting (presence or absence of any white spotting on the body or face) was fit as a fixed effect in the model. Although this effect was significant (<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0025)  the QTL for degree of black on BTA6 remained strongly significant. Second  the analysis was repeated using the subset of non-spotted animals (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>167)  and the QTL on BTA6 was detected as before. Both of these analyses confirm that degree of black and spotting are the result of separate loci and that these loci are probably tightly linked. Because of the known association between  and coat color  breed-of-origin of a 1 Mb region that spans these three genes and centered on  was assigned for 204 of the 208 F Nellore-Angus cattle. Breed-of-origin of this region and an interaction of breed-of-origin with sire was significant (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). For all sires  NN homozygotes for the  region differed (<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) from AA homozygotes for degree of black  and red pigmentation appeared to be recessive and was associated with the Nellore allele. For three of the sires  the NN homozygotes had less black pigmentation as compared with any alternate breed-of-origin combination (AN  NA  and AA)  whereas the remaining sire had NN homozygotes different from AA homozygotes  but not AN or NA genotypes. Fitting breed-of-origin of the  region into the original model accounted for the variation attributed to the major locus on BTA6 (Figure C). Modeling specific haplotype pairs instead of breed-of-origin permitted the same SNP haplotypes (and presumably the same alleles of these three tyrosine kinase receptors) to be present in both  and . However no  region phased haplotypes were shared between the Nellore and Angus founders and therefore did not provide any additional information from the breed-of-origin genotypes previously described. Because long-range haplotypes are recovered in this population due to linkage  we considered candidate genes up to 5 Mb from the leading SNP. The gene  () is located 3.7 Mb upstream of  and is associated with lighter coat colors in mice []. Haplotypes and breed-of-origin were assigned as before and 13 recombinants with degree of black scores were identified (Figure ). Assuming that the reddening associated with the Nellore allele was recessive  the interval could be refined to a region between 71708424 and 72478577 bp on BTA6 (Figure )  thereby eliminating the coding sequences of    and  as candidates. Although we cannot rule out possible effects of long-range regulatory elements associated with these genes  based on its location within the refined interval   appears to be the strongest positional candidate for the reddening phenotype.          The animal identifier for each genotype (AA  AN  NA  NN where allele from sire is listed first) is followed in brackets by the raw degree of black score and the residual after adjusting for fixed effects of sex  family  and season; vertical solid black lines indicate the interval most likely to contain the reddening locus under the assumption that reddening is associated with the Nellore allele and acts as a recessive; genes within this region (excluding model genes designated as “LOC”) are plotted based on their start and end base pair positions using “|”. For the major locus on BTA6  the strongest positional candidate gene is   which is a member of the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) family that consists of two receptors (a and ß) and four ligands (A-D). Although we are not aware of any previously documented role for  in cattle coat color  its function and cellular responses have been extensively studied in the developing mouse. To function as a tyrosine kinase receptor  the PDGF-receptor must first bind a ligand  then dimerize with another ligand-bound PDGF-receptor (reviewed by Hoch and Soriano []). Signal transduction pathways including the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (Ras-MAPK)  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  and phospholipase C<U+03B3> pathways can be activated by both PDGF-receptors. In relation to pigmentation   has been shown to have a role in mouse hair follicle development [] and possibly in melanocyte migration [] although differentiation of the roles of  and  is difficult. Based on its functions described in mouse (reviewed by Hoch and Soriano [])   could influence the MAPK signaling pathway in melanogenesis and therefore the expression of   which controls a complex cascade of events in melanogenesis []. Furthermore   can activate the expression of the  () gene and influence Ca levels  thereby directly impacting melanin synthesis. During melanogenesis   drives melanocyte migration from the neural crest along the dorsolateral pathway. Mutations associated with  result in white coat color or white spotting in numerous species including cattle []. In 2012  it was shown that color sidedness in cattle is determined by translocations that include the  locus []. Although we are not aware of any previously reported association of KIT with reddening  it is possible that copy number variation in this region may be a factor and warrants further investigation. Located approximately 3.7 Mb upsteam of  is the gene  that encodes a mosaic protein expressed primarily in the heart and necessary for pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) activation. Enshell-Seijffers et al. [] characterized  expression in the dermal papilla of the hair follicle and found that mice homozygous for the  mutation (C/C) had lighter coat colors than mice with at least one functional . This observation depended on the genotype at the  () gene  where at least one wild type or functional  allele was necessary for homozygous  mutants to express the altered pheomelanin production. The  mutation was associated with an increase in the length of the basal band  which contains pheomelanin. Because of this  a larger proportion of the hair shaft contained pheomelanin and therefore produced a lighter coat color than wild types. A variant agouti protein was observed in only one family in our population (data not shown)  which ruled out a similar interaction in cattle as the reason for the large effect observed. Nigrovic et al. [] reported that a dominant spotting mutation termed W in mice contains a genetic inversion that affects a regulatory element for   downstream of  in the 3’ breakpoint and disrupts  expression due to the 5’ breakpoint that occurs between the fifth and sixth exons. Structural variation or other regulatory elements in the  interval cannot be ruled out based on these data and will be explored using higher density assays in the future. Suggestive and significant QTL at the chromosome-wide level were identified on BTA4 and 5 using interval analysis for degree of black  but these QTL were not confirmed by single-marker association or Bayesian methods. The major locus at 72 Mb on BTA6 accounted for 43.75% of genetic variation using BayesB procedures with  = 0.995. This region coincides with a cluster of  genes including     and . Fitting breed-of-origin of the 1 Mb region that contains these three genes in the model accounted for the majority of variation attributed to the major locus. Therefore  one of these three coding genes  or an associated structural or regulatory variant  is probably responsible for the majority of the variation in the reddening phenotype. Recombinants within the F Nellore-Angus cattle identified  as the strongest positional candidate gene for the reddening phenotype using the current marker panel  but additional positional candidates are present (e.g.  ). Further research using higher density markers and functional analyses will be required to confirm the role of  or other genes  and structural or regulatory variants  and their interaction with  for the modification of black coat color in these cattle influenced by .

This study focuses on alternative low-cost genomic selection methods (IBD-GS) that use selective genotyping with sparse marker panels to estimate identity-by-descent relationships through linkage analysis. Our aim was to evaluate the potential of these methods in selection programs for continuous traits measured on sibs of selection candidates in a typical aquaculture breeding population.MethodsPhenotypic and genomic data were generated by stochastic simulation  assuming low to moderate heritabilities (0.10 to 0.30) for a Gaussian trait measured on sibs of the selection candidates in a typical aquaculture breeding population that consisted of 100 families (100 training animals and 20 selection candidates per family). Low-density marker genotype data (~ 40 markers per Morgan) were used to trace genomic identity-by-descent relationships. Genotyping was restricted to selection candidates from 30 phenotypically top-ranking families and varying fractions of their phenotypically extreme training sibs. All phenotypes were included in the genetic analyses. Classical pedigree-based and IBD-GS models were compared based on realized genetic gain over one generation of selection.ResultsGenetic gain increased substantially (13 to 32%) with IBD-GS compared to classical selection and was greatest with higher heritability. Most of the extra gain from IBD-GS was obtained already by genotyping the 5% phenotypically most extreme sibs within the pre-selected families. Additional genotyping further increased genetic gains  but these were small when going from genotyping 20% of the extremes to all phenotyped sibs. The success of IBD-GS with sparse and selective genotyping can be explained by the fact that within-family haplotype blocks are accurately traced even with low-marker densities and that most of the within-family variance for normally distributed traits is captured by a small proportion of the phenotypically extreme sibs.ConclusionsIBD-GS was substantially more effective than classical selection  even when based on very few markers and combined with selective genotyping of small fractions of the population. The study shows that low-cost GS programs can be successful by combining sparse and selective genotyping with pedigree and linkage information."

All phenotypes were included in the genetic analyses. Classical pedigree-based and IBD-GS models were compared based on realized genetic gain over one generation of selection. Genetic gain increased substantially (13 to 32%) with IBD-GS compared to classical selection and was greatest with higher heritability. Most of the extra gain from IBD-GS was obtained already by genotyping the 5% phenotypically most extreme sibs within the pre-selected families. Additional genotyping further increased genetic gains  but these were small when going from genotyping 20% of the extremes to all phenotyped sibs. The success of IBD-GS with sparse and selective genotyping can be explained by the fact that within-family haplotype blocks are accurately traced even with low-marker densities and that most of the within-family variance for normally distributed traits is captured by a small proportion of the phenotypically extreme sibs. IBD-GS was substantially more effective than classical selection  even when based on very few markers and combined with selective genotyping of small fractions of the population. The study shows that low-cost GS programs can be successful by combining sparse and selective genotyping with pedigree and linkage information. Recently  genomic selection (GS)[] has led to a paradigm shift in quantitative genetic analyses and selective breeding programs. GS was originally developed on the basis that all selection candidates and training animals are individually and densely genotyped. However  implementation of GS has been hampered in many species by the cost of genotyping large numbers of animals. For species like dairy cattle  for which traditional selection schemes focus mainly on the male candidates and necessarily involve progeny testing  GS can often be implemented more cost-effectively by genotyping a limited number of male selection candidates and reducing the need for progeny testing. In species with a higher female fecundity  selective breeding focuses on both sexes. Aquaculture breeding programs represent the most extreme of these  in which both males and females have an extremely high fecundity. Moreover  since some of the most important aquaculture species are single spawners under certain conditions (e.g.  Atlantic and Pacific salmon)  progeny testing is uncommon and organized breeding programs are often based on sib-testing (for invasive traits). Such breeding populations are usually large  with many training animals and numerous selection candidates of both sexes. Genotyping costs are thus the main obstacle for the successful large-scale implementation of GS in aquaculture species. Such costs can be reduced by: (1) genotyping fewer samples (either fewer animals or pooled samples) and (2) genotyping fewer marker loci per sample (e.g.  genotyping by sequencing regions of the genome). However  the challenge is to find a balance between genotyping costs and accuracy of selection. Pooled genotyping will be investigated in a future study and will not be further discussed here. The current study focuses on the use of combined selective and sparse genotyping in GS  which can greatly reduce genotyping costs  but the potential advantage of GS over classical pedigree-based selection in these conditions remains uncertain. The methods suggested by Meuwissen et al.[] imply that identity-by-state (IBS) information from all available marker loci is used  i.e.  a given marker allele is assumed to have the same statistical effect on phenotype across different familial backgrounds. Thus  all marker alleles that are IBS are assumed to have the same effect  which can be explained by the existence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the marker and one or more quantitative trait loci (QTL). However  Luan et al.[] showed small differences in accuracies of genetic evaluations of dairy bulls when using genomic identity-by-descent (IBD) relationships within the known pedigree (traced by markers) instead of the IBS relationships suggested by Meuwissen et al.[]. In the following  these two methods of GS will be termed IBD-GS and IBS-GS  respectively. Assuming base animals are unrelated  IBD-GS uses only information from known  and thus close relatives  which typically share long chromosomal segments IBD. In comparison  the (LD-based) haplotype blocks found across a population are much shorter[]  both for domesticated breeds and  even more so  for large wild populations. Tracing large IBD-blocks within a known pedigree does not require dense markers  which makes IBD-GS less sensitive to marker density  compared to the more widely used IBS-GS. Although IBS-GS does not use the pedigree explicitly (and thus IBD information)  it does use the available population structure  i.e.  IBD relationships necessarily imply sharing of marker alleles (but not vice versa). Hence  in a domesticated population under artificial selection  differences in IBS relationships between individuals are largely explained by close relationships  rather than by relationships due to common ancestors prior to the known base population. For IBS-GS  it has also been shown that relationships with reference individuals have a much higher effect on accuracy of resulting genomic breeding value predictions than LD []. Furthermore  IBS-GS in pedigreed populations can be used to predict genomic breeding values even in the absence of LD  which shows that markers capture close relationships among genotyped animals  and thereby affect accuracy of predictions[]. IBD-GS is expected to use this information more accurately but at the cost of not using LD that may exist between markers and QTL. Use of the IBD-GS method has the potential to reduce marker density  while maintaining the efficiency of GS and taking the entire heritable variance into account. Yet  the number of animals to be genotyped can lead to a significant cost. Thus  in this study  our aim was to investigate whether IBD-GS can be effectively combined with selective genotyping of selection candidates and training animals. From this perspective  the advantage of IBD-GS over IBS-GS is that the accuracy of predicted breeding values depends on the number of genotyped and phenotyped known relatives  rather than on genotyping of the whole population. Hence  the IBD-GS method may provide accurate genomic EBV (estimated breeding values) for specifically targeted families by preferentially genotyping high-ranking families (based on phenotypic/pedigree-based pre-selection). Furthermore  the genotyping of training animals could focus on the individuals that are most informative for prediction of Mendelian deviations from the mid-parent means  which are the phenotypically most extreme sibs (in both directions); the intermediate sibs mainly provide information about mid-parent means (which are easily estimated with classical methods)  and are thus less informative for prediction of Mendelian deviations from the parental means. The aim of the study was to quantify whether a low-cost IBD-GS scheme could provide a significant increase in genetic gain for traits evaluated on sibs of selection candidates  compared to classical selection schemes  as applied in aquaculture breeding populations. The low-cost approach combines sparse marker panels (or genotyping by sequencing) with selective genotyping of a subsample of the selection candidates and the phenotypically most extreme training sibs of these candidates. The QMSim software[] was used to simulate all datasets. All scenarios were replicated 50 times. The genome was assumed to consist of 20 chromosomes  each 100 cM long  with 1200 potential marker loci and 80 potential QTL. Mutation rate for both markers and QTL was set to 3.0*10. To simplify the simulation and statistical analysis  only recurrent allele mutations were allowed  and therefore only bi-allelic loci (similar to single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) existed. Loci (both marker and QTL) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) below 5% (in the founder population of the pedigree) were deleted. The QTL effects were sampled from a gamma distribution with shape parameter 0.4. A base population with effective population size <U+2009>=<U+2009>500 was simulated for 5000 generations in order to achieve mutation-drift balance. At generation 5000  ~4000 marker loci (~200 per chromosome) and<U+2009>~<U+2009>240 to 280 QTL segregated with a MAF above 5%. From generation 5000  100 males and 100 females were randomly selected and each male was randomly mated with a single female  resulting in 100 families  each consisting of 120 full-sibs (12 000 individuals per generation). The same population structure was used to simulate the three subsequent generations (5001 to 5003). Phenotypes and genotypes (for a fraction of the animals) were stored only for generations 5001 to 5003  which were used in the subsequent genetic analysis. No selection was applied within these generations. Breeding values were defined as the sum of all QTL effects for each individual. The QTL effects were rescaled such that the total additive genetic variance (variance of breeding values summed over all QTL) was equal to 0.30 for all replicates (in generation 5001). Standardized random residuals for phenotypes were sampled independently from a standard normal distribution and subsequently scaled by the appropriate environmental standard deviation. Phenotypes were defined as the sum of the breeding values and the scaled random residuals. Two scenarios were simulated  one with heritability h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10 and one with heritability h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.30. Datasets with different heritabilities were generated from the same simulation datasets by changing the residual standard deviation used for scaling of the standardized residuals. Hence  breeding values and genetic variance were identical in the parallel replicates across scenarios with different heritabilities. Of the 120 sibs in each family  100 sibs were randomly selected as training animals (phenotyped and were not available for selection) and the remaining 20 were chosen as selection candidates (non-phenotyped validation animals). Descriptive statistics of the data sets are given in Table . Genotyping was performed by sampling every 5 marker (the first and last marker of each chromosome were always retained) from the complete dataset  i.e.  ~40 markers/Morgan (M). These markers were then used to trace genomic relationships within the known pedigree  as described in the next section (considering parents from generation 5000 as base animals). To mimic a situation with selective genotyping  marker genotypes were stored only from parents (generations 5001 and 5002) and individuals of the phenotypically best (based on the average phenotype of the 100 training sibs) 30 of 100 families in the last generation (generation 5003). It was considered unlikely that candidates from the remaining 70 families would be selected (even with marker data  which was confirmed by later results). Furthermore  within the best 30 families  marker genotypes were stored for all selection candidates (20 per family) and for varying fractions of the phenotyped training sibs (the top and bottom 5 to 20%  or all sibs). Thus  the total number of genotyped individuals ranged from 900 to 3600 out of 12 000 individuals (per generation). The different genotyping strategies are described in Table . Markers were traced through the pedigree by linkage analysis using the linkage disequilibrium multi-locus iterative peeling (LDMIP) method[] based on information from all genotyped marker loci and the entire pedigree (using parents from generation 5000 as base population). The output was used to calculate IBD probabilities at each genotyped marker locus[] and the genome-wide IBD relationship matrix was produced by averaging over all loci. The IBD matrix also included IBD probabilities of non-genotyped animals  using information from relatives to estimate their genotypes[]. Non-genotyped non-parents were consequently assumed to have standard pedigree relationships with all their sibs  but not necessarily with more distant relatives (as their relationships are influenced by the relationships among genotyped ancestors). Animals not related through the pedigree were considered unrelated  regardless of their marker genotypes. Two statistical models  pedigree-based (PED) and IBD-GS  were applied to all datasets and scenarios to estimate BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) breeding values with the DMU software package[]. Both models had the following general characteristics: where  is a vector of all phenotypes   is the overall mean   is a vector of additive genetic breeding values of all animals included in the pedigree  is a vector of random residuals  is the residual variance and  is an appropriate incidence matrix. The two models only differed in their distributional assumptions for the additive breeding values: where is the additive genetic variance   is the pedigree-based numerator relationship matrix  and  is the IBD-based genomic relationship matrix  calculated as described above. The true variance components were assumed known. To evaluate the IBD-GS method  it was compared to classical pedigree-based selection methods. Animals were ranked based on their predicted breeding values from the PED and IBD-GS models  respectively. Predicted breeding values (either PED or IBD-GS) were used to select 200 parents for the next generation. Genetic gain in the first generation is expected to equal the average genetic level of the parents deviated from the population average in the previous generation. Hence  efficiency of classical pedigree-based selection vs. IBD-GS using selective genotyping was assessed by comparing the average true breeding values of the selected parents (from generation 5003) for the two models. Since none of the selection candidates had their own phenotype available (only sibs with data) classical selection based on PED implied family selection  i.e.  all 200 selected individuals would originate from only 10 families (with 20 candidates each) unless restrictions are imposed. Hence  for classical selection  the number of selected offspring was restricted to 10 per family  and future parents were thus randomly sampled from the 20 top-ranking families. GS allowed individual selection also for non-phenotyped (albeit genotyped) animals. In practice  one would then select the best animals based on EBV across families. The lowest-ranking sibs within the best families are probably outperformed by the highest-ranking sibs among the second-best families  which implies that future parents are selected from a wider range of familial backgrounds. Hence  for GS  there was no need to put any restrictions on selection. Results showed that future parents were indeed selected from nearly all 30 pre-selected families. Selection based on the two models was compared based on the expected rate of inbreeding  which was approximated as[]: where  is the relative genetic contribution of parent  (appearing as parent for generation ) to generation <U+2009>+<U+2009>1  and k<U+2009>=<U+2009>200 (total number of parents per generation). The two models were also assessed for bias by regression of true breeding values on predicted breeding values. A regression coefficient equal to 1 indicates proper scaling  < 1 indicates inflation and<U+2009>><U+2009>1 indicates deflation of the predictions. IBD-GS led to a substantial increase in genetic gain over one generation  compared to classical selection (Figure )  especially with higher heritability. For a moderately heritable trait (h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3)  the increase in genetic gain with IBD-GS compared to classical pedigree-based selection was substantial  with relative increases of 23  28  31 and 32% by genotyping the phenotypic most extreme (top/bottom) 5  10  20%  and all training sibs  respectively. Hence  most of the extra gain with IBD-GS was already obtained by genotyping the top and bottom 5% training sibs for the 30 pre-selected families. For a low heritable trait (h<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1)  the extra gain with IBD-GS was lower (13 to 21%) but  again  most of the extra gain was achieved with genotyping of the top and bottom 5% of training sibs of the pre-selected families.  Genetic gain in genetic standard deviation units for classical pedigree-based selection schemes (PED) and GS-IBD using sparse and selective genotyping for different numbers of genotyped phenotypically extreme sibs (IBD#<U+2009>=<U+2009>genotyping the # phenotypically best and worst training sibs of each family  IBDall<U+2009>=<U+2009>genotyping all training sibs). Although restrictions with respect to inbreeding were imposed only for the classical selection scheme  the unrestricted IBD-GS scheme had lower average rates of inbreeding (1.04 to 1.13% vs. 1.25%) and new parents were recruited from more (26 to 29 vs. 20) of the 30 pre-selected families (Table ). The average regression coefficients across replicates (standard deviations) of true breeding values on predicted breeding values are in Table . Across replicates  the pedigree-based model had an average regression coefficient close to the expectation (1.0) and was thus unbiased. IBD-GS was also unbiased when all members of preselected favorable families were genotyped (IBDall). However  selective within-family genotyping of phenotypically extreme sibs resulted in slight  albeit significant bias at the highest heritability  in terms of inflated variance of genomic EBV (Table ). Nevertheless  when looking at single replicates  the pedigree-based model frequently deviated more from the expected regression coefficient than the IBD-GS model. The study shows that for traits that are evaluated on sibs of selection candidates  substantial increases in genetic gain can be achieved through IBD-GS using sparse marker genotyping on small sub-samples of carefully selected individuals  e.g.  900 to 1800 animals per generation from a population of 12 000 individuals. Using this approach  only the best 30% of families were genotyped (for both selection candidates and training animals). In most cases  no candidates were selected from the lowest ranking preselected family. Hence  genotyping more families would probably not change selection decisions for this population structure. Most of the potential advantage of IBD-GS relative to classical selection was already obtained when the 5% top and bottom training sibs from the pre-selected families were genotyped. Furthermore  there was little practical difference in response to selection between genotyping the 20% top and bottom vs. all training sibs. However  when analyzing real data  extreme observations may be artifacts and selective genotyping strategies using small and highly selected samples are likely be more vulnerable to such errors. Hence  careful quality control of the data is particularly important when combined with selective genotyping. Genotyping larger fractions (i.e. 10 to 20%) would increase robustness of the IBD-GS analysis. In this study  both models required pedigree information. For aquaculture species for which tagging is impossible at young ages  it may be necessary to separate families until they reach tagging size  which increases the costs of family production and creates physical limitations in the number of families that can be produced  and potentially introduces common environmental family (tank) effects. Still  genome-wide SNP markers (as in IBD-GS) can be used to trace parentage of individuals with high accuracy  even with communal rearing e.g.[  ]. However  when within-family selective genotyping is to be used  prior knowledge of the pedigree is required  i.e.  favoring separate rearing of families. Fortunately  separate rearing is already common practice in many existing aquaculture selection programs for traits that are evaluated on sibs of selection candidates (e.g.  in )  and thus the structure necessary to apply selective genotyping exists. In contrast  for mass-spawning species  for which artificial stripping is difficult to apply  e.g.  gilthead seabream ()  communal rearing may be the only practical alternative. Furthermore  mass-spawning species typically have rather chaotic family structures (many small families  and uneven contributions of parents)  which makes within-family selective genotyping difficult to apply  even when family background can be deduced (e.g.  through an initial parentage assignment based on microsatellites). Alternatively  parentage testing and sparse genotyping for IBD-GS may be combined into one genotyping test but then additional saving from selective genotyping is not being used. This study considered selection on a single trait but real selection programs are often multi-trait and can include more than one trait measured on sibs of selection candidates. In such cases  selection of the families to be genotyped would be based on a total merit index. In some cases  traits measured on sibs are recorded on different subsets of training sibs. This would still allow the proposed strategy for within-family selective genotyping to be used for each trait separately  but would require genotyping more animals. If multiple traits are recorded on the same group of training sibs  sibs for genotyping could be selected based on their total merit index. These animals are not necessarily the most phenotypic extremes for each trait but they are expected to be the most extreme with respect to the aggregated genotype  which is what we want to predict and genetically improve. When genotyping is restricted to phenotypically extreme sibs  estimates of genetic variation may be inflated  resulting in biased EBV. However  results from a previous study indicate that when non-genotyped sibs are included in the analysis through pedigree information (as in the current study)  accurate estimates of genetic variance can still be obtained for larger selectively genotyped samples[]. In the current study  the true genetic variance was assumed known (i.e.  BLUP)  which reduces the risk of inflated variation of EBV. Still  a statistically significant but small bias in terms of inflated variance of EBV was detected with IBD-GS  but the limited magnitude of the inflation indicates that the bias would not be a problem in practice. The bias detected was of similar magnitude as previously reported for other GS approaches e.g.[  ]. Furthermore  the pedigree-based model (which was unbiased when averaged over replicates) showed larger between-replicate variation. Hence  for real data  pedigree-based evaluation may actually give larger scaling errors than IBD-GS using selective genotyping. Although there were no restrictions on inbreeding and genetic gain was faster  inbreeding rates were systematically lower with IBD-GS than with pedigree-based selection schemes. Here  the expected rate of inbreeding was estimated over only one generation of selection. In the longer term  differences between the two methods are expected to be more substantial and in favor of IBD-GS because pedigree-based selection for traits measured on the sibs will favor co-selection of relatives. Furthermore  imposed recruitment of parents of less favorable EBV  as was done for the pedigree-based program  can reduce inbreeding in the short term but the long term contribution of such parents may be low. In the IBD-GS scheme parents were solely selected based on EBV  which is expected to give more even long-term genetic contributions of the selected parents compared to a classical selection scheme imposing selection of genetically inferior parents. It has been stated that GS is particularly useful for traits with low heritability[]  which is indeed likely to be true for traits that are recorded directly on selection candidates as well as on sibs. With classical selection for traits of high heritability  individual phenotypes will compensate for the lack of precision achieved with sib data. For a trait measured only on sibs  the extra genetic gain from IBD-GS over pedigree-based selection is more likely to increase with increasing heritability. This is because  with pedigree-based selection  the EBV of all selection candidates is set equal to their mid-parent EBV  regardless of heritability  while IBD-GS allows estimation of Mendelian deviations from this mean  even without individual phenotypes. In the current study  mid-parent means are expected to be accurately estimated in both models  even for traits with low heritability because of the large number of phenotyped offspring (100 per family)  while accuracies of the estimated Mendelian sampling deviations from these means (predicted in IBD-GS) are expected to be greater with high heritability. As a consequence  the extra gain from IBD-GS increases with increasing heritability of the traits evaluated on sibs. The greater benefit of IBD-GS for traits with higher heritability is evident from our study; the classical pedigree-based model showed similar genetic gains (6% different) for traits with a low or moderate heritability  while for IBD-GS  genetic gain was substantially greater (15 to 16%) for traits with moderate versus low heritability. This study considered genetic gain over only one generation  starting from a previously unselected population. In practice  selection is usually continued over several generations  and the Bulmer effect would (as long as selection continues) reduce between-family variation in the population[]. As a consequence  the ability to use within-family (Mendelian) genetic variation will be more important for future generations (and more so if restrictions are imposed on inbreeding). Thus  because classical sib-selection does not use within-family variation the relative advantage of GS is expected to increase if selective breeding is applied over multiple generations. Genomic selection simulation studies are typically based on several idealized assumptions  including: (1) QTL effects are strictly additive; (2) all heritable variation is explained by the additive QTL effects  (3) all alleles originate from a single base population  which implies consistent population-wide LD (no segmentation of the population)  and (4) marker and QTL alleles follow similar frequency distributions. In practice  these assumptions do not necessarily apply: many populations have mixed origins  QTL and markers do not necessarily follow the same distributions (e.g.  QTL loci are often subjected to selection) and non-additive (dominance and epistatic) genetic effects exist. Through sexual reproduction and recombination  non-additive effects are often not passed on to future generations  which reduces their relevance for selective breeding. However  epistatic effects between linked loci are expected to be more sustained over generations and evidence for epistatic interactions between linked loci has been reported for different species[  ]. Within families  haplotypes of linked loci are likely inherited as one block  i.e.  as if they were a single locus[]. Similarly  transgenerational epigenetic inheritance[]  such as chromatin marking (including methylation)  can also contribute to inherited differences and thus contribute to the heritable (“additive”) variation  i.e.  the variance available for selective breeding. Such heritable factors  may partly explain the so-called “missing heritability problem” that is typically observed with IBS relationships[]. These effects of local epistasis and transgenerational epigenetics (chromatin marking) may  however  be effectively captured by genomic IBD relationships. Thus  the IBD-GS model is expected to take such effects into account. One of the main advantages of the IBD-GS method is that it can effectively use sparse marker genotypes and selective genotyping. In contrast  IBS-GS methods are intended for dense marker data[] and sparse genotyping would require a sparse-to-dense imputation step (i.e.  dense marker data must be available for preceding generations). Furthermore  IBD-GS is well suited for the joint analysis of data from non-genotyped and genotyped individuals (e.g.  as in selective genotyping)  which is likely to introduce bias in IBS-based analyses. The IBD-GS method is thus easier to implement for analysis of selectively genotyped and sparse marker data and of phenotypic data that do not necessarily fit the idealized conditions that are typically assumed in stochastic simulation studies. The IBD-GS was substantially more effective than classical selection  even when based on very few markers  and when combined with selective genotyping of small proportions of the population  i.e.  900 to 1800 out of 12 000 individuals. The study shows that a low-cost GS program can be successfully performed by combining sparse and selective genotyping with pedigree and linkage information. Thus  the IBD-GS method is suitable for cost-effective genomic evaluation using sparse markers  for selective genotyping of training animals  and for phenotypic data that do not necessarily fit the idealized conditions that are typically assumed in stochastic simulation studies.

Structural equation models (SEM) can be used to quantify the causal relations between traits  which allow prediction of outcomes to interventions applied to such a network. Such models are fitted conditionally on a causal structure among traits  represented by a directed acyclic graph and an Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm can be used to search for causal structures. The aim of this study was to explore the space of causal structures involving bovine milk fatty acids and to select a network supported by data as the structure of a SEM. The IC algorithm adapted to mixed models settings was applied to study 14 correlated bovine milk fatty acids  resulting in an undirected network. The undirected pathway from C4:0 to C12:0 resembled the  synthesis pathway of short and medium chain saturated fatty acids. By using prior knowledge  directions were assigned to that part of the network and the resulting structure was used to fit a SEM that led to structural coefficients ranging from 0.85 to 1.05. The deviance information criterion indicated that the SEM was more plausible than the multi-trait model. The IC algorithm output pointed towards causal relations between the studied traits. This changed the focus from marginal associations between traits to direct relationships  thus towards relationships that may result in changes when external interventions are applied. The causal structure can give more insight into underlying mechanisms and the SEM can predict conditional changes due to such interventions. In animal breeding and genetics  relationships between traits are traditionally studied using multi-trait mixed models []. Such models do not allow for recursive relationships between traits that are generally present in biological systems. Structural equation modelling (SEM) is a statistical technique for testing and estimating such recursive relationships [–]. Gianola and Sorensen [] described SEM in a quantitative genetics context in order to account for possible feedback or recursive relations among traits in multi-trait mixed models settings. In most applications of SEM in animal breeding and genetics  only few hypothesized networks are typically tested and compared  and those that best fit the data are declared as most plausible [–]. Although such an approach avoids the computational challenges involved in testing every possible network  it does not explore the full space of possible networks. However  data driven exploration of the space is possible using the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm []. The IC algorithm is based on conditional independencies tests  such that under multivariate normality  it can be implemented by using partial correlations tests. When all partial correlations between a pair of traits are non-null for each conditioning subset of traits (i.e.  they are dependent conditionally on all possible sets of other traits)  then a direct causal relation between this pair of traits is declared. When a partial correlation between two traits is null (i.e.  they are independent conditionally on at least one set of other traits)  then there is no direct causal relation between this pair of traits. Therefore  partial correlations can be explored to study how a set of traits is causally related and this can be qualitatively represented by a graph or network []. If the resulting network is completely directed  it can be used as a causal structure of a SEM  and the magnitude of causal relationships among traits (represented by structural coefficients) can be estimated by fitting such a model. Furthermore  visualization of the causal relationships among variables on a graph could help understand and interpret complex biological systems  while their quantification allows prediction of outcomes of external interventions applied to such a causal network. The inferred structural coefficients associated with connections between traits in a network only carry a causal interpretation under specific causal assumptions. For example  structural coefficients inferred from a SEM with an acyclic causal structure and independent residuals only keep their causal meaning under the assumption that there are no hidden causal effects that have a direct influence on two or more traits in the network. In livestock  removing such confounding effects can be achieved by performing randomised experiments. However  most livestock data come from non-randomised field studies and are prone to the influence of several sources of systematic variation. When measured  the confounding generated by these systematic sources of variation can be controlled by correcting for them in a model. One example of hidden factors that may affect two or more traits in the network is correlated genetic effects. Thus  the genetic covariances are background sources of phenotypic covariances among traits that confound not only the inference of causal effects between pairs of traits  but also the search for causal structures  because algorithms may interpret such covariances as due to causal relations among phenotypes. Therefore  Valente et al. [] proposed to use the inferred residual (co)variance matrix of a standard multi-trait mixed model (which represents the covariance matrix among traits conditionally on the genetic confounders) as input for the IC algorithm  instead of the observed data  when searching for causal structures in mixed effects settings. Valente et al. [  ] used simulated data to show that applying the IC algorithm to the posterior distribution of the residual (co)variance matrix of a multi-trait mixed model recovered the correct network  and Valente et al. [] used the methodology on real data from quails to study causal networks involving five traits. Here  we applied the same approach to a set of 14 highly correlated milk fatty acids to analyse their causal relations. Fatty acids are important components in human diets with either beneficial or unfavourable effects on human health  depending on the fatty acid. Studying causal relations between bovine fatty acids in milk can provide valuable information about the synthesis of fatty acids  which could be useful for approaches aimed at changing the fatty acid composition of dairy products and ultimately at improving human health. Since a considerable amount of knowledge about the synthesis of fatty acids is available  the network obtained from the adapted IC algorithm can be compared to known biological pathways. However  the network may also reveal new relations that could confirm existing hypotheses or create new ones. The known biological pathways include  synthesis  biohydrogenation and desaturation of milk fatty acids. Most of these pathways are reflected in the results of analyses that involve phenotypic and genetic correlations between milk fatty acids [–]  clustering techniques [  ]  or principal component analysis []. These studies suggest that certain fatty acids have a common origin  but they cannot distinguish between direct and indirect relationships. Our aim was to explore causal networks between milk fatty acids by applying for the first time the adapted IC algorithm as presented by Valente et al. [] to 14 highly correlated traits. In addition  the selected network was used as the causal structure of a SEM to quantify the relationships between the milk fatty acids. Data on the fat composition of winter milk samples from 1902 first-lactation Dutch Holstein Friesian cows were used. The cows were housed on 397 commercial farms throughout the Netherlands. At least three cows between 63 and 282 days in milk were sampled per farm. The pedigree of the cows was supplied by CRV (Cooperative cattle improvement organization  Arnhem  the Netherlands) and included information from the last four generations (4676 animals). Milk fat composition was measured by gas chromatography (details about the phenotyping are in Stoop et al. []). Fourteen fatty acids with the highest concentration in milk fat were considered: even-chain saturated fatty acids C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0  C12:0  C14:0  C16:0  C18:0  even-chain () monounsaturated fatty acids C10:1  C12:1  C14:1  C16:1  C18:1  and the polyunsaturated fatty acid CLA (conjugated linoleic acid  C18:2  ). Gas chromatography was performed on fat samples and provided relative amounts of fatty acids expressed on a fat basis in g/100 g fat. However  these relative amounts do not properly represent the biological relationships among fatty acids; therefore the fatty acids were expressed on a milk basis in g/kg milk. Table  presents the mean and adjusted phenotypic standard deviation for the fatty acids included in this study. Genetic and residual (co)variances among traits were estimated by fitting a Bayesian multi-trait mixed model that uses latent variables to fit (co)variance structures and a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples for variance components  similar to the latent variable models to estimate genomic (co)variances in Sørensen et al. []. Latent variables were used to fit (co)variance structures because most of the milk fatty acids were strongly correlated  both genetically and residually. Fitting a standard multi-trait model for 14 milk fatty acids resulted in convergence issues  but using latent variables to reduce the dimensionality of the data improved convergence of the Bayesian multi-trait mixed model. Phenotypes were standardised to traits with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to reduce scale differences between the milk fatty acids in the multi-trait mixed model. The following multi-trait model was fitted: with the joint distribution of vectors  and  as: where  is a vector of phenotypes;  is a vector for systematic effects  for each trait the same systematic effects were included: a covariate for days in milk modelled with a Wilmink curve []  a covariate for age at first calving  a covariate for age at first calving squared  a fixed effect for calving season (June-Aug 2004  Sept-Nov 2004  or Dec 2004-Jan 2005)  a fixed effect for sire code (accounting for differences in the genetic level between proven sire daughters and test-sire daughters)  and a fixed effect for herd;  is a known incidence matrix of  on ;  is a vector of random additive genetic effects;  is a known incidence matrix of  on ; and  is a vector of random residuals.  is the additive genetic (co)variance matrix;  is the additive genetic relationship matrix;  is the residual (co)variance matrix;  is an identity matrix. The (co)variances between genetic effects and between residuals were modelled employing  latent vectors  to model residual (co)variances  and  latent vectors  to model genetic (co)variances  such that  and   with <U+2009>~<U+2009>(0 <U+2009>) and <U+2009>~<U+2009>(0 <U+2009>) as standard Normal latent vectors   and  as regressions or “loadings” on the latent vectors with uniform priors [–8  8]  and  and  as the independent remaining variances for residuals and genetic effects per trait . From the latent variable model  the residual variance for trait  is   and the residual covariance between traits  and  is . In a similar manner  the variances  and covariances  were obtained for the additive genetic effects. In order to maintain mixing in the MCMC sampling algorithm  the remaining independent variances  and  must remain well above 0. Initially  this large set of highly correlated traits resulted in residual and polygenic variances  and  that were close to 0  thus it was necessary to set a minimum value for them and uniform priors [0.02  8] were used on these parameters to achieve this. Because standardised traits were used  these bounds imply that at least 2% of the residual variance for each trait was not explained by residual covariances with other traits  and likewise at least 2% of the genetic variance for each trait was not explained by genetic covariances with other traits. All fixed and random effects (including latent variables) and the regression loadings were conditionally normal  and conditional distributions for variance parameters were scaled inverse Chi square in the MCMC implementation. The dimension of latent variables  is to be pre-set but good indications for this dimension can be obtained by a principal component analysis on the traits analysed  which gives information on the number of latent variables suitable to model the joint (co)variance structure. In order to limit the constraints on the covariance structure  the number of principal components was chosen such that together they explained 90% of the variance. Principal component analysis of the 14 fatty acids showed that the first four principal components explained ~90% of the variance; therefore four latent factors were chosen. The MCMC software Bayz 2.1 [] was used for parameter inference. Eight chains of 1 million iterations each were run  with a burn-in of 100 000 for each chain  and a thinning of 1000 iterations. Convergence was checked by visual inspection of the sample trace plots  of posterior density plots and by determining effective sample size using the Coda package in R []. By fitting the multi-trait mixed model described above  the data can be corrected for systematic effects and for genetic (co)variances and thus  inferences regarding the joint distribution of the traits conditionally on genetic and systematic effects can be made. This is important to search for the causal structure using the IC algorithm  because correlated genetic effects are confounding factors  since they are sources of phenotypic correlation due to the genetic background but not due to recursive relations among traits []. The relevant information to be used in a causal structure search is in the residual (co)variance matrix that results from a multi-trait mixed model. Therefore Valente et al. [] proposed to use this matrix as input for the IC algorithm to search for causal networks  instead of using the observed data. The IC algorithm performs a series of statistical decisions based on partial correlations between traits. The posterior distributions of partial correlations were obtained using the posterior samples of residual (co)variance matrices from the multi-trait analysis and these were then used to test for non-null partial correlations. A partial correlation was declared non-null whenever the highest posterior density (HPD) interval did not include zero. The expected output for the IC algorithm is a partially oriented graph that represents a set of statistically equivalent causal structures. The IC algorithm consisted of three steps []: Partial correlations were used to search for edges that connect adjacent variables (two vertices that are endpoints of an edge) to obtain an undirected graph (e.g.  -). If all partial correlations of two traits conditional on each possible set of other traits were different from zero  an edge was placed between the traits. Partial correlations were also used to search for unshielded colliders (three connected variables in a path directed as <U+2009><U+2192><U+2009><U+2009><U+2190><U+2009>) to orient some edges of the undirected graph provided by step 1. If partial correlations of two non-adjacent traits (e.g.  Y and Y) that have a common adjacent trait (Y) in such an undirected graph are dependent conditional on any possible set that includes the adjacent trait (Y)  the edges should be oriented towards the common adjacent trait (Y)  such as in <U+2009><U+2192><U+2009><U+2009><U+2190><U+2009>. When possible  remaining undirected edges were oriented in a way that introduced no new unshielded colliders or cycles. This step could only be performed when the graph obtained in step 2 contained unshielded colliders and the orientation followed unambiguously from the graph. Relationships represented by the causal network obtained from the IC algorithm were quantified using a SEM  as in Gianola and Sorensen []. The SEM was fitted using Bayesian methods that fit a multi-trait mixed model in software Bayz 2.1 []  where causal parents (e.g.   is causal parent of  in <U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>) of a given trait were considered as covariates in the equations assigned to this trait  and a diagonal residual (co)variance matrix was imposed. Therefore  the following model was fitted: with the joint distribution of vectors  and  as: where the model was similar to the multi-trait model as described above but with the addition of (<U+2009><U+2009>)  where  is a <U+2009>×<U+2009> (with  equal to the number of traits) matrix with 0’s on the diagonal and with structural coefficients or 0’s on the off-diagonals. The causal structure defines which of the off-diagonal entries of  must be estimated and which ones are set to 0.  is the SEM additive genetic (co)variance matrix and  is a diagonal matrix with the SEM residual variances. The residual covariances between the traits in the SEM were assumed to be 0  which confers identifiability to the structural coefficients in the likelihood function. The priors used for the SEM were the same as those used for the multi-trait model. The SEM was compared with the multi-trait model using the deviance information criterion (DIC) []. The DIC takes the trade-off between model goodness-of-fit and corresponding complexity of model into account. Models with smaller DIC are better supported by the data. Eight independent MCMC chains of the Bayesian multi-trait animal model for the 14 bovine milk fatty acids converged to similar estimates of the variance components  which was confirmed by trace and density plots. The effective sample size for heritabilities  correlations and (co)variance components ranged from 391 to 2431 samples. Posterior means of the heritabilities  genetic correlations and residual correlations between milk fatty acids are shown in Table . Fatty acids that are consecutively synthesized  (e.g.  C4:0 and C6:0  C6:0 and C8:0  etc.) generally showed strong positive correlations  both genetically and residually. Residual correlations between medium chain unsaturated fatty acids (C10:1  C12:1  C14:1) and long chain fatty acids (C18:0  C18:1  CLA)  and between CLA and C8:0  C10:0  and C12:0 were weak and showed large standard deviations. There were no strong negative correlations between fatty acids. The IC algorithm based on the 95% HPD interval retrieved the undirected network presented in Figure  (black solid edges). Consecutive fatty acids C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 formed a path of connected nodes. The fatty acids C10:1 and C12:1  as well as C14:1 and C16:1  were also connected to each other. The HPD interval content was reduced to see if there were additional less strong connections between the fatty acids  which may give better results if posterior distributions are not very sharp [  ]. Reducing the HPD to a probability of 90% resulted in the same network as the HPD interval of 95% (black solid edges in Figure ). Reducing the HPD interval to 85% resulted in four additional edges: between C4:0 and C16:0  between C6:0 and C14:0  between C8:0 and C12:0  and between C18:0 and C18:1 (grey dashed edges in Figure ). Reducing the interval further to 80% resulted in two additional edges: between C8:0 and C14:0 and between C18:1 and CLA (blue dotted edges in Figure ).  The connections obtained with a HPD interval of 95% and 90% are given in black solid lines  with a HPD interval of 85% in grey dashed lines  and with a HPD interval of 80% in blue dotted lines. No unshielded colliders were recovered from the data in step 2 of the IC algorithm. Therefore  step 3 of the IC algorithm did not result in any additional edge orienting and the resulting network remained undirected. A SEM was used to quantify the causal relationships between the milk fatty acids based on a causal structure that was chosen based on the outputs of the IC algorithm. Since a fully oriented structure is required to specify a SEM  the undirected network obtained with the 95% HPD interval (Figure   black solid edges) was oriented according to prior biological knowledge about the sequence in which the fatty acids are synthesized in the mammary gland. In this sense  the path C4:0—C6:0—C8:0—C10:0—C12:0 agreed with the  synthesis of milk fatty acids. According to the  synthesis  C4:0 should precede C6:0  C6:0 should precede C8:0  and so on. On this basis  the path C4:0—C6:0—C8:0—C10:0—C12:0 could be directed from C4:0 to C12:0  that is C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0  C12:0. The five traits involved in this path were analysed with both a multi-trait model and a SEM. Both models were compared in terms of fit and parameter inferences. The causal network chosen for the SEM shown in Figure  resulted in the following structure for the -matrix:  The edges in the fitted structure represent the causal relations for the observed variables (C4:0-C12:0)  with independent residuals (e-e) and correlated additive genetic effects (u-u). The posterior densities of the structural coefficients that resulted from the SEM are in Figure . The posterior means of these parameters ranged from 0.85 to 1.05 (Figure ).                                                      Table  shows the posterior means for the parameters from both the multi-trait model and the SEM for C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0. As pointed out by Valente et al. []  genetic effects from multi-trait models and SEM have different meanings: the latter represent direct genetic effects (i.e.  genetic effects that are not mediated by other traits in the causal network)  while the former represent overall genetic effects (i.e.  a combination of all direct and indirect genetic effects on each trait). Model specific genetic (co)variances refer to the (co)dispersion of the genetic effects of each model  and therefore have distinct meanings as well. The posterior means of the genetic variances of the multi-trait model for C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 were fairly similar to each other (i.e.  between 0.360 for C4:0 and 0.276 for C12:0)  while the posterior means of the SEM genetic variances for C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 showed a gradual decrease (i.e.  0.460 for C4:0  0.114 for C6:0  0.073 for C8:0  0.066 for C10:0 and 0.004 for C12:0)  indicating that indirect genetic effects from upstream traits were gradually explaining a larger portion of genetic variability. Such reduction was even stronger for the SEM residual variance. Statistically  this result was expected because conditioning on the strongly correlated traits in the SEM removed a large proportion of the observed variance. On the basis of the given causal structure  this indicates that the variability of each of these fatty acids can be almost fully explained by the conditioning (parent) fatty acid. The posterior means of the genetic and residual variances of C4:0 for the SEM were similar to those for the multi-trait model  because C4:0 was not conditioned on any of the other traits. The posterior means of the genetic correlations from the SEM refer to the genetic covariance that is left after conditioning on the appropriate fatty acids  i.e.  it expresses the correlation between direct genetic effects for each trait. For that reason  the SEM genetic correlations were different from the correlations estimated with the multi-trait model. The DIC for the multi-trait model for C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 was -21 083  while the DIC for the SEM using the structure depicted in Figure  was -32 406  indicating that the studied structure is plausible []. This lower DIC for the SEM is partly due to a lower penalty for model complexity in the DIC for the SEM. Although the SEM introduces sources of covariance from the causal associations  the residuals of the SEM were assumed to be uncorrelated  which resulted in a model that was more parsimonious than the multi-trait model. This lower penalty for model complexity was reflected by a lower effective number of parameters (5152 for the SEM and 6829 for the multi-trait model). The aim of this study was to explore causal networks of milk fatty acids by applying the IC algorithm in a mixed model context. Undirected acyclic graphs were obtained for several HPD intervals. A subset of five fatty acids formed a structure that could be directed based on prior knowledge and this structure was then used in a SEM to quantify the relationships between them. The networks obtained for the 14 fatty acids were undirected. Based on the known sequence of the synthesis of fatty acids  edges could be directed without creating cycles or unshielded colliders that were not supported by the data. Fatty acid C4:0 precedes C6:0  which in turn precedes C8:0 and so on in the  synthesis  which led us to suggest that the path containing C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 is directed from C4:0 to C12:0. This means that the final network is not completely data-driven. However  the structure for this subset of fatty acids that is plausible based on biological knowledge does not have colliders  so the fact that the algorithm could not detect directions was expected. Therefore  not finding any unshielded colliders among these fatty acids supports the hypothesis of a path directed from C4:0 to C12:0. The search space does not contain cyclic structures and non-linear relations are also not considered in the specific application presented here. Instead  as in most studies  it was assumed that relationships between traits were linear but in reality they could be non-linear. In contrast to the assumptions of the adapted IC algorithm applied here  SEM can be extended to include  for instance  interactions  feedback mechanisms (cyclic relations)  quadratic terms or polynomials to determine which model fits the data best [  ]. In addition  the search algorithm could make decisions based on alternative tests for conditional independence instead of on partial correlations []. Connections between variables are often referred to as causal relations  but the only widely accepted method for declaring causation between two variables is a randomised experiment. This involves random assignment of each subject to different treatment groups  coupled with random assignment of treatment level to each group  and results in averaging out potential sources of confounding effects. In the analysed data  variables that act as confounders are not averaged out  but when they are measured  they can be included in the model to correct for this confounding effect. Based on model assumptions  causation can be inferred  but because of the impossibility of declaring with absolute certainty that there are no additional unmeasured causal variables  these assumptions cannot be guaranteed. The IC algorithm is based on the assumption that there are no hidden variables that affect more that one of the variables considered in the model  which is called the causal sufficiency assumption []. If this assumption does not hold  there may be direct connections between variables that are not causal relations but that are due to other sources  such as common hidden causes. Although a SEM does not require this assumption  it is commonly applied for the sake of model identifiability. Metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of milk fatty acids  such as  synthesis  desaturation and biohydrogenation  could be reflected in the structure provided by the IC algorithm. In the following  the network obtained with the IC algorithm will be compared with known metabolic pathways of milk fat synthesis. For this comparison  two aspects should be noted. First  the variables studied here are fatty acids excreted in the milk  which are not necessarily the same variables as the corresponding fatty acids involved in the milk fat synthesis pathways  e.g.  C6:0 measured in milk is not the same as a C6:0 in the elongation cycle of the  synthesis being transformed into C8:0. This is especially important considering that the SEM expresses the causal effect between fatty acids excreted in the milk  which are the recorded phenotypes. These causal effects reflect expected results of (ideal) external interventions. However  the expected consequences of modifying a fatty acid that is excreted in the milk on other fatty acids may not be the same as the consequences of manipulating the amount of a specific fatty acid during synthesis in the mammary gland. The second aspect is that the proposition that an object B originates from an object A does not necessarily imply that causal effects between measurements  and  made respectively on A and B must be directed as . Therefore  if fatty acid B originates from fatty acid A in the synthesis process in the mammary gland  measurements of the concentration of these fatty acids in the milk ( and ) are not necessarily directed as  if they are causally connected. So it is possible that edges may actually have alternative directions  and that is not a strict contradiction of known biochemical paths. For example  inoculating C8:0 in the mammary gland could affect the amount of C6:0 released in the milk  which would be an effect that is opposite to the description of how C8:0 originates from C6:0  but does not deny that C8:0 originates from C6:0. Although one could defend such an alternative structure (and other statistically equivalent ones)  the structure chosen to fit the model is credible given its expected intervention outcome. For instance  the chosen structure expresses that if C8:0 is inoculated in the mammary gland  then C4:0 and C6:0 would remain the same  but such intervention would affect C10:0 and also  indirectly  C12:0. This is compatible with a scenario in which C8:0 is inoculated: C4:0  and C6:0 would be normally produced since their synthesis occurs earlier in the cycle  and less C8:0 would be released in the milk  since its concentration is already high due to the inoculation (in case there is some regulation of fatty acids production by the concentration of free fatty acids). This would leave more “substrate” remaining within the cycle for the subsequent fatty acids and would result in increasing C10:0  and so forth. This is compatible with the causal meaning of the chosen structure (and the inferred structural coefficients  if they are positive). It should be noted that in this case  the meaning of the graph C4:0<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>C6:0<U+2009><U+2192> C8:0<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>C10:0<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>C12:0 depends on whether it is interpreted as a biochemical pathway that shows how fatty acids are originated or as a SEM that involves the concentrations of such fatty acids  although both interpretations could be represented with the same nodes and directed connections. For the structure of the SEM fitted (C4:0<U+2009> C6:0<U+2009><U+2009>C8:0<U+2009><U+2009>C10:0<U+2009><U+2009>C12:0)  directions were chosen that mirror the  pathway  because it is plausible (although not necessary) based on how the fatty acids are generated and on that basis  if the underlying causal structure indeed reflected the metabolic pathway  the expected output of the search algorithm would be exactly C4:0—C6:0—C8:0—C10:0—C12:0. Short and medium chain saturated fatty acids (C4:0-C14:0 and about half of the C16:0 present in milk) are produced in the  synthesis pathway. In this metabolic pathway  the carbon chain is elongated in a sequential cyclic reaction from acetate and ß-hydroxybutyrate until a C16:0 fatty acid is formed by fatty acid synthase in the mammary gland e.g.  [  ]. In the bovine  all intermediate fatty acids can leave the elongation cycle by a chain termination mechanism [] and thus end up in bovine milk. The path from C4:0 to C12:0 that was obtained from the IC algorithm with a HPD interval of 95% (black solid edges in Figure ) mirrored this  synthesis. One could argue that the path obtained from the IC algorithm should also include C14:0 and C16:0 but part of C14:0 and C16:0 originate from the cows’ diet  which might have reduced the degree of association with the remaining pathway  thus leading the search algorithm to declare them disconnected from the remaining variables  i.e. excluding them from the pathway. The structural coefficients that were estimated using the SEM with the causal structure C4:0<U+2009><U+2009>C6:0<U+2009><U+2009>C8:0<U+2009><U+2009>C10:0<U+2009><U+2009>C12:0 indicate that if C4:0 increases 1 g/kg milk  then C6:0 would respond by increasing 1.05 g/kg milk (Figure ). However  the molar mass of C6:0 is 1.32 times the molar mass of C4:0  so although the relationship is nearly one to one unit-wise  is less than one based on molar mass. The structural coefficients  and  were slightly lower than  and   possibly because a small part of C10:0 and C12:0 is desaturated into C10:1 and C12:1 in the mammary gland. These structural coefficients suggest that an intervention that increases the amount of C4:0 secreted in milk would result in an increase in C6:0 secreted in milk and that would in turn result in an increase in C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0 secreted in milk. Medium chain saturated fatty acids (C10:0-C16:0) are desaturated by coenzyme A desaturase 1 () into their equivalent mono-unsaturated fatty acids (C10:1-C16:1) in the mammary gland [  ]. Structures that mirror this desaturation pathway (e.g.  C10:0  C10:1) were not recovered by the IC algorithm (Figure ). The obtained structures (C10:1—C12:1 and C14:1—C16:1) showed that the amount of mono-unsaturated medium chain fatty acids measured in milk are not causally associated with the amount of their equivalent saturated fatty acid  but suggest that the mono-unsaturated medium chain fatty acids may have a common hidden causal variable among them. Long chain fatty acids (half of the C16:0 present in milk and all fatty acids with 18 or more carbons) originate from the diet fed to cows and are biohydrogenated by micro-flora in the rumen into C18:0 and multiple intermediate products []. Some edges were recovered between the long chain fatty acids  e.g. between C18:0 and C18:1  and between C18:1 and CLA  which likely represent this biohydrogenation process. These edges were recovered when the HPD interval was relaxed to 80-85%  which indicates weak evidence for these edges (Figure ). Reducing the HPD interval resulted in additional edges. The edges that involve long chain fatty acids might be plausible associations but the edges between C4:0 and C16:0  C6:0 and C14:0  C8:0 and C12:0  C8:0 and C14:0 appear to be false positive associations due to the lowered threshold. To conclude  although the fatty acids were measured when secreted in milk and not during their synthesis in the mammary gland  concentrations of fatty acids in milk mirror some of the metabolic pathways  and resemblance with the  synthesis pathway obtained most evidence. The search for causal structures among a set of variables makes sense if associations exist between them. However  if many traits have strong correlations with each other  fitting multi-trait mixed models may encounter convergence issues  which was the case in the current study. Most milk fatty acids were strongly correlated with each other  both genetically and residually. Fitting a standard multi-trait model for 14 milk fatty acids resulted in slow MCMC convergence  strong auto lag correlations in the chain and thus in a small number of effective samples. Running the MCMC Bayz 2.1 [] program using latent variables to reduce the dimensionality of the data improved convergence of the Bayesian multi-trait mixed model. A principal component analysis showed that using four latent variables was reasonable for the multi-trait model with 14 fatty acids. Using latent variables has some effect on the modelled (co)variance structures; because the latent variable model uses less parameters than the full (co)variance matrix  the (co)variance structure is somewhat restricted  similar to using only the main principal components in a principal component analysis or frequentist factor analytic model  e.g.  []. In this case  the latent variable model used 70 parameters [(4 <U+2009>+<U+2009>1)<U+2009>×<U+2009>14 ] for each of the environmental and genetic (co)variance structures  whereas the full (co)variance matrix has 105 parameters. For the multi-trait model for C4:0  C6:0  C8:0  C10:0 and C12:0  two latent variables were used  resulting in 15 parameters and thus no restrictions on the (co)variance matrix. The multi-trait model for C4:0 to C12:0 resulted in the same pathway as the model with 14 traits  suggesting that the restriction in parameters due to latent variables did not influence this particular pathway. A final measure to improve convergence was to set minimum bounds on the remaining independent variances  and  for residuals and genetic effects through the prior distributions. These minimum bounds were set at 0.02 (on standardised phenotypes)  which implies that heritabilities were constrained to be between 2 and 98%  and that all correlations were forced to remain slightly below 1. These adaptations were required for the model to converge such that this dataset could be explored for causal networks. The approach suggested by Valente et al. [] is more complex and computationally demanding than the standard use of the IC algorithm and other similar methods that simply work with unconditional point estimates of covariance matrices  not requiring prior model fitting. Although this is appealing in the context of mixed effects SEM  there is a compelling reason to follow the approach of Valente et al. [] because mixed effects SEM allow direct genetic covariances  which are extra genetic sources of associations among traits  aside from causal effects. Assuming these genetic associations to be absent would be more difficult to accept  since genetics most likely affects multiple traits of a set in a way that is not mediated by other traits in the set. Using the IC algorithm on raw data assumes that these correlated direct genetic effects do not exist and  therefore  requires assumptions that are more difficult to accept. Furthermore  using the output from such an IC analysis in a mixed effects SEM with unstructured genetic covariances implies inconsistency of assumptions in the different analysis steps. The computation time of the IC algorithm increases rapidly with an increasing number of analysed traits  because of the increasing number of partial correlations to be tested. The IC algorithm required testing the partial correlations between each pair of fatty acids conditional on all possible subsets of the remaining fatty acids. With 14 traits there are 91 distinct pairs of traits [<U+2009>×<U+2009>(<U+2009>-<U+2009>1)/2] and 4096 possible conditioning sets (2)  leading to 372 736 partial correlations to be calculated for each posterior sample of the residual (co)variance matrix (i.e.  2<U+2009>×<U+2009><U+2009>× (<U+2009>-<U+2009>1)/2). In addition  the size of the posterior sample also affects computation time. Additional thinning of the MCMC speeds up computation time for the adapted IC algorithm. Parallel computing would be a promising strategy to reduce the computation time of the algorithm. However  other refinements to the method used here will be needed when the number of variables increases strongly  for instance with high-throughput gene expression data  such as microarray or RNA-seq. Correlations between traits play a role in livestock management practices. These correlations can result from different causal relationships  such as direct or indirect causal effects between traits  or from a common causal parent  or even from a combination of these. The concentrations of fatty acids in milk are clearly correlated  but the partial correlations indicate that only a few are directly connected in the network. Even an undirected structure is informative and reveals direct and indirect associations between variables. Nonetheless  prior knowledge may be used to orient additional edges  and resulting causal inferences can then be confirmed with additional data and studies. Representing the associations between traits with networks may provide better insights into the underlying biological mechanisms and offer opportunities for management tools to focus on pathways instead of correlations. Response to interventions applied to a biological system can be predicted using SEM. Shifting the focus from correlation matrices to causal diagrams might result in faster and better understanding of responses to interventions. The principles of the IC algorithm and SEM can also be used to investigate gene regulatory networks in gene expression studies [–]. Understanding the relationships between genes can  for instance  identify targets for intervention that could contribute to the development of therapies for certain diseases. Application of the adapted IC algorithm proposed by Valente et al. [] resulted in an undirected network for the 14 milk fatty acids studied. The pathway from C4:0 to C12:0 reflected the  synthesis pathway of short and medium chain saturated fatty acids. By using prior biological knowledge  directions were assigned to that part of the network and the resulting structure was used to fit an SEM. The edges between C10:1 and C12:1 and between C14:1 and C16:1 did not correspond to associations reported in the literature  which might be due to a common hidden causal variable. Other expected relations based on biological knowledge were not found or were detected only when the HPD interval was relaxed. The output of the IC algorithm suggested causal relations between the studied traits. This changes the focus from marginal associations between traits to direct relationships that may result in changes when external interventions are applied. The causal structure can give more insight into underlying mechanisms and the SEM can predict conditional changes due to such interventions.
