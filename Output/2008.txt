The purpose of this work was (i) to assess the genetic variability of RFI estimated by an X-ray technique and (ii) to develop predictive criteria for RFI. Two predictive criteria were tested: loss of body weight during feed deprivation and compensatory growth during re-feeding. Ten heterozygous rainbow trout clones were used. Individual intake and body weight were measured three times at threeweek intervals. Then  individual body weight was recorded after two cycles of a three-week feed deprivation followed by a three-week re-feeding. The ratio of the genetic variance to the phenotypic variance was found high to moderate for growth  feed intake  and RFI (/ = 0.63 ± 0.11  0.29 ± 0.11  0.29 ± 0.09  respectively). The index that integrates performances achieved during deprivation and re-feeding periods explained 59% of RFI variations.

The purpose of this work was (i) to assess the genetic variability of RFI estimated by an X-ray technique and (ii) to develop predictive criteria for RFI. Two predictive criteria were tested: loss of body weight during feed deprivation and compensatory growth during re-feeding. Ten heterozygous rainbow trout clones were used. Individual intake and body weight were measured three times at threeweek intervals. Then  individual body weight was recorded after two cycles of a three-week feed deprivation followed by a three-week re-feeding. The ratio of the genetic variance to the phenotypic variance was found high to moderate for growth  feed intake  and RFI (/ = 0.63 ± 0.11  0.29 ± 0.11  0.29 ± 0.09  respectively). The index that integrates performances achieved during deprivation and re-feeding periods explained 59% of RFI variations. These results provide a basis for further studies on the origin of RFI differences and show that indirect criteria are good candidates for future selective breeding programs.

One environmental factor that can affect the response to selection in breeding programs is the density at which the shrimp are cultured (low-medium-high). Phenotypic plasticity in the growth response to different densities might be accompanied by a significant genotype by environment interaction  evidenced by a change in heritabilities between environments and by a genetic correlation less than one for a unique trait between environments. Our goal was to understand whether different growth densities affect estimates of those genetic parameters for adult body weight (BW) in the Pacific white shrimp (). BW heritabilities were significantly different between environments  with the largest at high density. These differences resulted from both an increased additive genetic variance and a decreased environmental variance when grown at high density. The genetic correlation between BWs at the two environmental conditions was significantly less than one. Whereas these results might be suggestive for carrying out shrimp selective breeding for BW under high density conditions  further understanding of genetic correlations between growth and reproductive traits within a given environment is necessary  as there are indications of reduced reproductive fitness for shrimp grown at high densities."

The least differentiation was observed between the two sub-populations of Mbarara south and Luwero in Uganda  while the highest level of differentiation was observed between the Mugamba in Burundi and Malagarasi in Tanzania. An estimated membership of four for the inferred clusters from a model-based Bayesian approach was obtained. Both analyses on distance-based and model-based methods consistently isolated the Mugamba sub-population in Burundi from the others. Correspondence to                 .  Ndumu  D.B.  Baumung  R.

Here  we apply a maximum-utility-strategy to prioritize 14 traditional Ethiopian sheep breeds based on their threat status  contributions to farmer livelihoods (current breed merits) and contributions to genetic diversity. Contributions of the breeds to genetic diversity were quantified using Eding's marker-estimated kinship approaches. Non-genetic aspects included threats ( low population size  low preferences by farmers) and current merits (economic  ecological and cultural merits). Threat analysis identified eight of the 14 breeds as threatened. Analysis of current merits showed that sub-alpine and arid-lowland breeds contribute most to farmer livelihoods in comparison to other breeds. The highest contribution to the genetic diversity conserved was from the Simien breed. Simien showed high between-breed (low between-breed kinship = 0.04) as well as high within-breed diversity (low within-breed kinship = 0.09 and high  = 0.73 and allelic richness = 6.83). We combined the results on threat status  current breed merits and contributions to genetic diversity to produce a ranking of the 14 breeds for conservation purposes. Our results balance the trade-offs between conserving breeds as insurance against future uncertainties and current sustainable utilization.

The influences of cytoplasmic effects were investigated by comparing animal models with and without a random term representing cytoplasmic effects. The models were applied to the eight-week weight  scan weight (mean 152 days) and ultrasonically scanned muscle and fat depth. The animal model included the random effects of animals and the maternal additive genetic  maternal permanent environmental and maternal common environmental effects. In total there were 24 569  10 509  8389  8369 records for the eight-week weight  scan weight  muscle depth and fat depth respectively. Four subsets were further analysed containing maternal lines with at least five  ten  fifteen and twenty animals/line. There was no evidence of cytoplasmic effects on eight-week weight and muscle depth. Cytoplasmic effects contributed 1–2% of phenotypic variance for scan-weight and fat depth  but the effect was generally non-significant (P > 0.05). As the number of animals per maternal line increased  the magnitude of cytoplasmic effects also increased for these traits. Direct heritability estimates for the eight-week weight  scan weight  muscle depth and fat depth using the full dataset were 0.18  0.25  0.24  and 0.21 respectively."

The models were applied to the eight-week weight  scan weight (mean 152 days) and ultrasonically scanned muscle and fat depth. The animal model included the random effects of animals and the maternal additive genetic  maternal permanent environmental and maternal common environmental effects. In total there were 24 569  10 509  8389  8369 records for the eight-week weight  scan weight  muscle depth and fat depth respectively. Four subsets were further analysed containing maternal lines with at least five  ten  fifteen and twenty animals/line. There was no evidence of cytoplasmic effects on eight-week weight and muscle depth. Cytoplasmic effects contributed 1–2% of phenotypic variance for scan-weight and fat depth  but the effect was generally non-significant (P > 0.05). As the number of animals per maternal line increased  the magnitude of cytoplasmic effects also increased for these traits. Direct heritability estimates for the eight-week weight  scan weight  muscle depth and fat depth using the full dataset were 0.18  0.25  0.24  and 0.21 respectively.

In order to further understand the functions of the porcine CA3 protein in muscle  the temporal and spatial distributions of its gene product were analysed and the association between the presence of specific polymorphisms and carcass traits in the pig was also examined. Real-time PCR revealed that the  mRNA expression showed no differences with age in skeletal muscles from Yorkshire pigs at postnatal day-1  month-2  and month-4. We provide the first evidence that  is differentially expressed in the skeletal muscle of Yorkshire and Meishan pig breeds. In addition  the whole pig genomic DNA sequence of  was investigated and shown to contain seven exons and six introns. Comparative sequencing of the gene from three pig breeds revealed the existence of microsatellite  160 in intron 5 and microsatellite  158 and a novel microsatellite marker that includes a tandem repeat of (TC) in intron 4.

In order to further understand the functions of the porcine CA3 protein in muscle  the temporal and spatial distributions of its gene product were analysed and the association between the presence of specific polymorphisms and carcass traits in the pig was also examined. Real-time PCR revealed that the  mRNA expression showed no differences with age in skeletal muscles from Yorkshire pigs at postnatal day-1  month-2  and month-4. We provide the first evidence that  is differentially expressed in the skeletal muscle of Yorkshire and Meishan pig breeds. In addition  the whole pig genomic DNA sequence of  was investigated and shown to contain seven exons and six introns. Comparative sequencing of the gene from three pig breeds revealed the existence of microsatellite  160 in intron 5 and microsatellite  158 and a novel microsatellite marker that includes a tandem repeat of (TC) in intron 4. We also determined the allele number and frequencies of the three loci in seven pig breeds and found that they are low polymorphic microsatellite markers. Statistical analysis showed that the  microsatellite polymorphism was associated with dressing percentage  internal fat rate  carcass length  rib number and backfat thickness in the pig.

It consists of two steps: (a) computing coefficients of determination (CD) of comparisons among groups of animals; and (b) building sets of connected groups. The CD of comparisons were estimated using a sampling-based method that estimates empirical variances of true and predicted breeding values from a simulated n-sample. A clustering method that may handle a large number of comparisons and build compact clusters of connected groups was developed. An aggregation criterion (Caco) that reflects the level of connectedness of each herd was computed. This procedure was validated using a small beef data set. It was applied to the French genetic evaluation of the beef breed with most records and to the genetic evaluation of goats. Caco was more related to the type of service of sires used in the herds than to herd size. It was very sensitive to the percentage of missing sires.

It consists of two steps: (a) computing coefficients of determination (CD) of comparisons among groups of animals; and (b) building sets of connected groups. The CD of comparisons were estimated using a sampling-based method that estimates empirical variances of true and predicted breeding values from a simulated n-sample. A clustering method that may handle a large number of comparisons and build compact clusters of connected groups was developed. An aggregation criterion (Caco) that reflects the level of connectedness of each herd was computed. This procedure was validated using a small beef data set. It was applied to the French genetic evaluation of the beef breed with most records and to the genetic evaluation of goats. Caco was more related to the type of service of sires used in the herds than to herd size. It was very sensitive to the percentage of missing sires. Disconnected herds were reliably identified by low values of Caco. In France  this procedure is the reference method for evaluating connectedness among the herds involved in on-farm genetic evaluation of beef cattle (IBOVAL) since 2002 and for genetic evaluation of goats from 2007 onwards.

The design included 51 262 animals recorded for production traits  and 53 205 litter size records were considered. Three production and three reproduction traits were analysed: average backfat thickness (US_M) and live weight (LWGT) at the end of the on-farm test  age of candidates adjusted at 100 kg live weight  total number of piglets born per litter  and numbers of stillborn (STILLp) and born alive (LIVp) piglets per litter.

The experiment was based on a granddaughter design  including five Large White and three French Landrace half-sib families identified in the French porcine national database. A total of 239 animals (166 sons and 73 daughters of the eight male founders) distributed in eight families were genotyped for 144 microsatellite markers. The design included 51 262 animals recorded for production traits  and 53 205 litter size records were considered. Three production and three reproduction traits were analysed: average backfat thickness (US_M) and live weight (LWGT) at the end of the on-farm test  age of candidates adjusted at 100 kg live weight  total number of piglets born per litter  and numbers of stillborn (STILLp) and born alive (LIVp) piglets per litter.
